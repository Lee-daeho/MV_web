These corporate mascots were often portrayed dancing and/or singing for an audience in a specific space, and generally they were anthropomorphized animals or objects, although a few might be humans. Some music videos involving 2000s Virtual Singers were also marketed as ringtone commercials that one could buy for their mobile phones, specifically due to the technological limitations of the time. Some iconic child-oriented examples of this aesthetic include Gummibär or Psycho Teddy, both created by the company Jamba!, while other more juvenile examples may include Hatsune Miku and the VOCALOID boom during the late 2000s. Since 2000s Virtual Singers were primarily popularized through TV ringtone commercials and holiday jingles, the aesthetic possibly started to fall out of style during the mid-2010s, since selling ringtones or wallpapers was no longer fashionable or convenient and they became more widely avaiable for free to the public. Some of the last examples of popular 2000s Virtual Singer commercials may include GUMMI GANGNAM STYLE by Gummibär. It was a parody of the song Oppa Gangnam Style by PSY, which was one of the most popular songs at the time. Some visuals associated with the 2000s Virtual Singer aesthetic include: Music videos involving the 2000s Virtual Singer aesthetic often used childish Eurodance songs, often being associated with the Bubblegum Dance subgenre from the Nordic countries. The songs are obviously sung by virtual voices that portray the mascots, and they often use repetitive lyrics or onomatopeias. They are meant to be memorable, energetic and fun, to captivate the younger target audiences. Although Jamba! (also known as Jamster worldwide) was one of the most popular ringtone companies ever and meaningfully carried the 2000s Virtual Singer aesthetic, they were heavily criticized in the mid 2000s for dishonest advertisements, repeated telephone spam towards its customers and charging users more money than necessary. Ringtone advertisements were a relatively new phenomenon at the time and consequently they were heavily unregulated by the law, so Jamster got away with its dishonest actions. The company had spent a lot of money on advertisements - at some point, multiple residents of the United Kingdom reported that they had seen Crazy Frog ads at least 26 times on the TV. Crazy Frog, despite the fact that it drove the ringtone industry to its peak in 2005, it also quickly became one of the most hated fictional characters ever because of the company's scams. The Jamster subscriptions were pretty overpriced consisted of approximately 27$ dollars per year, and at its best, it had a total of 15 million subscribers. The clients reported that Jamster repeatedly spammed their phone numbers, and that simply messaging \"STOP\" to them wouldn't work and they would use multiple accounts to spam. Users also reported being unknowingly charged more money than necessary, and that the ringtones they could download were really different from what was originally advertised. For the 2000s Virtual Singer aesthetic, this was disastrous because people stopped trusting ringtone subscriptions and by the early 2010s they started to become obsolete. Jamster would eventually close its ringtone market and instead they developed another scam: a fake anti-virus app which reported false viruses and essentially did nothing meaningful. This led to the full downfall of the company, and in 2014, the company became defunct. Today, a fair amount of 2000s Virtual Singer ringtones are lost media as more companies were closed.

It influenced several internet aesthetics as we know them today. The aesthetic itself contains elements that are nostalgic to a great part of the people who grew up with them, such as internet memes, media, videos, characters, flash games and music. Several aesthetics like Scene, Frutiger Aero, Old Web, MLG, Old Meme, Internet Awesomesauce and many more were prominent during this phase. This also includes taking a liking to things like My Little Pony and Creepypasta. Visuals include but are not limited to bright colors, dancing characters, pixel art, low-quality images, and many more aspects that can largely vary. There is no true beginning for this aesthetic, but many major nostalgic media started from the year 2007. For example, the troll face meme was created in 2008 and drawn by Carlos Ramirez. It spread across websites such as Reddit, Imgur, and Facebook. Along with this, another funny face \"Epic Smiley / Awesome Face\" gained popularity in 2007.  These emoticons were popularly used during the 2010s internet era adding to the aesthetic. 2007 was also a year when social media began blowing up, sites such as Facebook and YouTube rose to prominence and forums and niche sites began to decline, marking a transition between old and modern web.

Similar to E-Girl and E-Boy, the term refers to chronically-online young teens who participate in TikTok trends and wear a newer iteration of alternative fashion. Unlike E-Girl, however, there is no sexual connotation to the aesthetic due to the fact that those participating are usually minors. It also tends to be more gender neutral. The fashion in 2020 Alt seems to come from newer trends seen from styles such as E-Girl, Mallgoth, and Scenecore, as well as Animecore and Kidcore. Oversized graphic t-shirts, sweatshirts, and hoodies are worn on top of striped undershirts or simply doubles with striped arm warmers. Bottoms are usually shorts or pleated skirts. These are often paired with chunky pump sneakers and Converses, Demonia boots, or plain Crocs. Legwear tends to be ripped tights or fishnets, which can be swapped or even doubled with knee-high socks and/or leg warmers propped up with garterbelts. Accessories may include kandi bracelets, cat ears, chokers, maid bonnets, or the very popular bunny/frog hats with long \"arms\". Casual looks may feature pajama pants. 2020s E-Kids tend to participate in many online communities and are most popular on TikTok. They tend to post content related to online hobbies and are known to communicate and congregate about them on chatrooms such as Discord, and Amino, in areas related to gaming, anime/manga, K-Pop, and various niche fanbases. Recently, video games such as Minecraft and Roblox have been used similarly as social media-like platforms and is where the style is seen the most. E-Kid accounts may post content related to trendy songs (which, in turn, are often used in video edits), fan blogs/zines, and may jokingly create videos with food/drinks such as Monster, Gatorade, \"Battery Acid\" (made by mixing the two together with sour candy), and sometimes featuring Asian cuisine. 2020 Alt is sometimes mislabled as Scene (or \"Scenecore\"), which resulted in further criticism from the Scene community. This likely resulted in the alternative name \"Posercore\". There are concerns with the \"chronically online\" aspect of children who participate in this aesthetic, especially with unrestricted internet access and unchecked amount of screentime potentially impacting their mental and physical health.",

It was utilized at a period when publishers preferred to stress their systems' realistic capabilities. This aesthetic's colors were often subdued with sepia/brown color filters, with strong directional shadows and a heavy bloom effect. Gears of War established standards for other companies to follow and served as a model for Unreal Engine 3 in other games of that generation. The dull colors of the aesthetic tended to lead to a Post-Apocalyptic setting with destroyed buildings, rubble, and a dusty sky, but other drab settings such as deserts and cities were also seen. The gritty aesthetic gained so much traction that video game mascots such as Sonic the Hedgehog used it in their titles. Designer Steves Peeps coined the phrase in 2023. With the debut of the eighth generation of consoles, including the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, this aesthetic's fall accelerated over time. With increased visual capabilities, using the aesthetic appearance was no longer necessary and, in the grander scheme, looked down upon.",

It grew out of graphic limitations of games that ran on hardware with 8-bit CPUs like Sega Master System, NES, Game Boy, Atari, and Virtual Pets. It is also associated with later games that didn't necessarily run on 8-bit hardware but still had limited graphics. It is characterized by blocky, sometimes extremely simplified pixel art and absence of dithering. Art, especially animated sprites, often lacks any outline or shading. Another common design element is text with a dropshadow to add legibility or visual appeal. Because of the low resolution (the consoles in particular were limited to 256-pixel resolution) of these systems relative to the display, the pixels were extremely large, particularly on consumer televisions which could easily be twice the size of a typical CRT display. While 8-bit is generally understood to correspond primarily with the Sega Master System and NES-based console games, this page includes earlier and similar-era media on other platforms like arcades and computers. Due to its nostalgia factor and the low cost of extremely simple graphics for amateur game design, the aesthetic has never entirely gone out of fashion. However, most \"retro 8-bit\" games tend to harken back to the 16-bit era rather than true 8-bit.[1][2] The earliest games published in the late 70s and early 80s were heavily limited by the color palettes and lack of understanding of how to work in what was essentially a new medium. The resulting games frequently presented a complete lack of detail or subtlety. Graphics lacked in dithering, aliasing or outlines and animation was extremely simplistic. Typical examples include Karateka, Space Invaders, Utopia and Winter Games. Some computer games continued to display a similar aesthetic well into the late 80s, like King's Quest. This era is here referred to as the Big Pixels sub-aesthetic. As the eighties progressed, early NES games introduced a different graphical paradigm to PC games, leading directly to the style today known as 8-bit, and characterized by its reliance on blocks of 8x8 pixels, which couldn't use more than three different colors. Further limits existed on the total number of sprites that could be displayed, such as the total number of colors, etc. This created an immediately identifiable look in games like Super Mario World and Pixel Medieval Fantasy games. As game design progressed, designers and artists developed tricks to get around these limitations leading to games like Kirby's Adventure and Mega Man 4-6. Even the simpler 16-bit games were a marked step up over their 8-bit equivalents. The difference is always very obvious when comparing an 8-bit game and its 16-bit successor or port: The exact nature of limitations varied depending on the exact systems involved, and were very different on earlier computers than on consoles. Early computer games had a specific aesthetic that we'll call Big Pixels: Classic 8-bit hallmarks: A peculiarity of 8-Bit graphics is that the pixels, especially on CRT televisions, had some black spaces around them, allowing for much subtler actual appearances than can be credited when looking at their equivalents on modern monitors.",

During The Matrix hype around 1999/2000, studios were quick to release the next Matrix by taking influence from the various styles that were done in the iconic film from 1999. The aesthetic was mostly known for its use of Bullet Time (a slow motion camera tracking shot) and its costumes which included black leather trench coats, combat boots, Oakley glasses, bullet proof vests, latex catsuits and dark formal wear. Action films exploded during the 80's with prominent stars such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, Jean Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris and Sylvester Stallone - this was the power house era of action cinema, which continued on even into early 1990's - but from around 1994, action films started to take a lot of inspiration from eastern action and anime, since this type of format was starting to pick up some traction from western audiences. Video games also became a slight influence on the action genre as certain plot details and story elements were heavily borrowed from video game tropes. The action genre at the time also started to use, computerized imaginary especially after the success of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. John Woo was the biggest influence on not only The Matrix but most western action films from the 90's on-wards. John Woo, director of Once a Thief (1991), Hard Boiled (1993) and Face Off (1997) included a lot of 90's Cool tropes in his films even before the aesthetic took off, once he started to produce more Hollywood action movies. He carried over a  lot of his signature techniques that would further add to the coolness factor, he was also one of the first to implement a sort of bullet-time one shot in the film Hard Boiled before The Matrix did. Once 1995 hit, action movies started to quickly adopt the cool factor, with these films being the prominent example of the aesthetic during both 1995 and 1996. The films included Hackers (1995), Desperado (1995), Heat (1995), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), Screamers (1995), Mortal Kombat (1995), Golden Eye (1995), Eraser (1996), Mission: Impossible (1996), Maximum Risk (1996) and Broken Arrow (1996). During this part of the aesthetic, there was a lot more emphasis on either hacking, espionage or lone savior tropes. The Y2K Futurism aesthetic was also used heavily around this time as a lot of the storytelling can often revolve around the growing threat of internet surveillance and digital malware - to put things in a better perspective, these films used a lot of camera techniques to hammer home the cool factor - things such as slo-motion, lomo effects, panning in and out, quick cuts and split screen splicing. At first glance it seems rather counter-intuitive that the era named after it could start before The Matrix was released in 1999. In truth, The Matrix took heavy inspiration from ongoing changes in 90's action movies. Things such as the growing rise of computer effects, anime and video game influences, the internet and of course a rise of science fiction; so the \"Matrix Effect\" period existed even before The Matrix was released to the masses. Movies like Blade (1998), Lost in Space (1998), The Fifth Element (1997), Double Team (1997) and Spawn (1997) all had an element of pre-Matrix action tropes that then allowed for The Matrix to eventually succeed after. Once 1999 entered the picture, this aesthetic blew up in a major way, and that then led to the golden period which was the early 2000's. Around this time, films started to look and feel exactly like The Matrix - it seemed like Hollywood studios wanted to achieve the same success the Wachowskis managed to do with their hit film - a ton of movies around this time were called the next Matrix, or at least followed the exact formula. Films such as Simon Sez (1999), Charlie's Angels (2000), Spy Kids (2001), Blade 2 (2002), X-Men (2000), Resident Evil (2002), Sword Fish (2001), Die Another Day (2002) and The Art of War (2000). Somewhere around the mid-2000s, the aesthetic was still around but winding down, especially after both the success of The Bourne films and The Nolan Batman reboot in 2005 - grittier became the norm, and overly CGI-riddled action films with a Nu-Metal soundtracks seemed out of place by 2006. This is why films like Ultraviolet (2006) did not resonate with audiences of that time, as it seemed rather out-of-date by that point. The movie was further compounded by being extremely Y2K in its visuals and looked like a long-winded music video from 2001. 2007 marked the death of 90s Cool, as by this point action films became more gritty and realistic, going forward with tons of shaky cam and a more \"hands-on\" displays of violence. With the heavy Y2K nostalgia in early-mid 2020s pop culture, one can assume that a revival of this movie-making style is overdue. 90s Cool is more vivid in it's marketing aesthetic, especially in posters and trailers it uses a ton of vibrant colors and displays psychedelic and abstract computerized images, usually of the main protagonist posing or facing directly towards the camera, the font is either bold or highlighted around the edges to make it stand out, and surrounding it is mostly computerized grids, this adds to the Y2K Futurism/Cyberpunk aesthetics respectively. Another vivid aspect of this aesthetic is the costuming which is often very dark and ominous, there is a big emphasis on looking cool so black leather is often the go to look that adds to that factor, this aesthetic also takes heavy inspiration from anime, hence why it shares similarities to shows like Tri Gun (1998), Akira (1988), Vampire Hunter D (1985) and Eat Man (1997). The movies that really personified the look of this aesthetic were both Blade and The Matrix, reinforcing the black leather look as the new action movie standard going forward, here is a list of key elements often used in the costume design of 90s Cool: This aesthetic used a lot of CGI art work and unique camera work to convey a sense of unworldliness, especially during that Matrix period we talked about earlier, campy CGI was often used in these films and it gave it a sort of unique quality. Other aspects include close up shots, split screen splicing, one take shots, slow rotation (AKA Bullet Time) and a lot of wire work in the choreography. Material Arts is usually the main component of this visual aesthetic, although it's nothing new in action films, the material arts during 90s Cool often mixed heavy uses of special effects such as CGI with the fights to give it that otherworldly feel. There was also a lot of wire work used around this time which increased even more after the release of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (2000). Here are some cinematic tropes often associated with this aesthetic. These are the films during the first wave of the 90s Cool, this was before The Matrix Effect really kicked things into motion, but these films still apply as they use many of the tropes and cliches, that we have been discussing here. This is when things kicked off, movies started to actually fully adapt this aesthetic. It all then accumulated with the release of The Matrix in 1999, although there where films before The Matrix that had very similar styles and tropes that would inspire The Matrix and every other 2000s action/Sci-Fi film going forward. This style was also heavily featured in television too, especially some what low budget TV or shows centered around some sort of espionage plot. The main aspects of 90s Cool became a lot more noticeable around 1998/1999 or so and then continued to explode in popularity from there, we also saw a heavy emphasis on girl power around this time with TV shows mainly focused on female protagonists as well as men. From around the time of The Matrix, popular music videos used to pay homage to The Matrix or other similarly styled movies. The music videos would usually feature espionage styled aesthetics, latex catsuits, black leather outfits, high tech gadgets, bullet time, CGI Effects and lo-mo effects. This was mainly due to the videos being composed as music for the movie soundtrack hence relating it to a similar theme. This was true in the music video for Lara Crofts: Tomb Raider, the popular band U2 released their music video for Elevation which features a lot of bullet time techniques that loosely pays homage to both Tomb Raider and The Matrix. I'm going to list all of the music videos that showcased a similar matrix styled vibe that was popular within 90s Cool, this was from roughly the late 90s to early 00s. During the late 90s, gaming started to appeal a lot more towards late teens and adults, especially with the release of both the Playstation and Playstation 2, gaming started to look a lot more edgy and gritty but this consigned with the rise of material arts heavy action that we discussed earlier and gaming went towards that direction, especially with the switch from 2D to 3D a lot of gaming became action orientated, this ushered in the rise of Mature Gaming with games such as, GTA Series (1997 - ), Metal Gear  (1987 - ), Max Payne (2001), Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2003) and Oni (2001). Like most things during this time it was influenced by The Matrix or the certain aspects of The Matrix seeped into these games, but a lot of action oriented games used a ton of bullet time, slow-motion, time splicing and freeze frame techniques in its mechanics to give it that unique feeling, Max Payne (2001), being the most notable as it has a heavy use of bullet time and time splicing. Another game that used matrix styled techniques is Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2003), in which you can rewind time before you die using a magical time altering dagger, both Resident Evil (1996 - ) and Metal Gear Solid (1998 - ) pre-date The Matrix, but still have uniquely action orientated mechanics that the 90s Cool aesthetic is known for.",

This aesthetic can primarily be found in science fiction media of the Digital Age, such as user interfaces (holographic touchscreens and heads-up displays), depictions of cyberspace, and other technological imagery. Examples include interfaces from Minority Report (2002) and Iron Man (2008), or the video game TRON 2.0 (2003) and the film TRON: Legacy (2010), as well as stock images and backgrounds/wallpapers related to keywords like \"technology,\" \"high-tech,\" \"digital,\" or \"cyber.\" Because many aspects and concepts related to software and digital technology are intangible, many people have resorted to using common abstract symbolism to signify the use of said technologies. An early example would be TRON (1982), which depicted a digital world with glowing lines, circles, and grids which partly inspired the Synthwave aesthetic. The Matrix (1999) is also notable for representing a simulated reality as green raining digital code, which became associated with computer hacking. According to designer Chris Noessel, the color blue became common in late-20th-century science fiction as it was associated with unnatural or artificial things.[1] The \"technological circle\" motif can be found in films as early as Star Wars (1977). However, the use of this aesthetic in its current form to portray the concept of \"technology\" would not become widespread until the 21st century with the increasing popularity of the Internet and the influence of sci-fi anime like Ghost in the Shell and live action movies like Minority Report and Iron Man. Abstract design motifs often described as \"high-tech\" include: In stock images, symbols such as locks (representing cybersecurity) or the shape of a brain (representing artificial intelligence) may be combined with the aforementioned motifs as well. The use of technology in business may be portrayed as a businessperson tapping a floating touchscreen with the associated design elements. By the Late-2010s, some commentators considered this stock imagery to be cliché.[2][3] Graphical user interfaces like these only appear in science fiction (known as \"fantasy user interfaces\" or FUIs[4]), stock images, or in user-customized desktop skins and widgets using software such as Rainmeter. Most default GUIs of tech products today tend to lean more towards the Flat Design aesthetic, which is intended to be more simple and user-friendly. Hexatron is a vague sci-fi aesthetic that was prominent throughout the 2010s following the end of the Frutiger Era, and is characterized by hexagons, neon blue, holograms, and futuristic technology. It maintains some Frutiger Aero motifs such as futurism, gloss, and 3D graphics, but contrasts it by largely omitting the nature-centered values of Frutiger Aero, incorporating sharp corners and edges to emphasise Abstract Technology. Hexatron influences are usually found in modern sci-fi media and real life gaming-tech equipment such as the DualSense controller. Hexatron is also adjacent with Cyberpunk, Neo-Vectorheart and DORFic due to their shared similarities. DORFic is an aesthetic featuring Abstract Tech-esque minimalist imagery that was popular from the Mid/Late-2000s to the Mid-2010s. DORFic is an acronym for daylight, orange, futurism, and the last 4 letters of the word \"graphic\" (simplified to \"Fic\"). This aesthetic is a subgenre of Frutiger Aero, Abstract Tech, and can be compared to Stecffism due to their shared element of being corporate.",

However the \"adventure\" subgenre also had a significant impact, drawing inspiration from the \"Lost World\" fiction and non-fiction explorer literature. The core of this aesthetic is perhaps the Indiana Jones franchise, which, beginning in early '80s, started as a tribute to the existing genre; the character of Indiana Jones was created as a pastiche of such heroes and historical figures, but in turn also redefined, revitalised and popularised the aesthetic in modern times, and spawned other tributes and ripoffs. The roots of the aesthetic are older and can be traced to the western colonialism, and represents a Victorian's romanticised perception of the Exotic. In a historical context, protagonists of the tradition were hardened western explorers, archeologists, hunters, officials, and even spies, who served and operated in Africa, \"the Orient\" (Asia and the Middle East), and the Amazon to contact other cultures and even primitive tribes. Those historical personalities had multidisciplinary background in many languages, cultures, history, engineering, wildlife, and nature. The limited knowledge and understanding of history and these undiscovered regions- and the high amount of superstition and pseudoscience prevailing in the era- gave to these stories a larger-than-life aura of mystery. Pseudohistorical and supernatural elements are common in fiction; even more recent works portray a highly fictionalised version of real-life locations and figures. Egyptian mysticism, curses, shamanism, out-of-place objects, ancient aliens, and extraterrestrial or Atlantean technology, are frequent tropes. Weird though it may sound (and on the other hand, quite fitting) the ancestor of perhaps all explorer/adventurer/archaeologist/egyptologists was an ancient Egyptian himself: Prince Khaemweset. He traveled around Egypt, visiting ancient temples and tombs of earlier dynasties, making restorations and rediscovering forgotten lore. After his death, his exploits were remembered in legendary literature; in one of those stories, which could have come out of a pulp magazine, he was seeking the lost \"Book of Thoth\" to augment his magic powers. He discovers it in an ancient tomb, but he ignores the warnings of the tomb's occupant, and is punished by its curse. In the beginning there was the Age of Discovery, which resulted to the Golden Age of Piracy and Colonization. The cruel conquistadors, when not slaughtering the natives and destroying their culture, heard some tales about \"lost cities\" with treasures and gold, and made (non-archaeological) expeditions to find them, fueled by lust and greed. This was the origin of El Dorado. Francisco de Orellana was the first to explore the Amazon river, which he documented; its name is credited to him, after fighting the Tapuyas, whose women he compared to the Amazones of classical literature. In the dawn of the 19th century Johann Ludwig Buckhardt worked for the African Association and travelled up to Syria. Having adopted arabic language, customs and appearance, he merged into the locals and thus learned about the \"lost city\" of Petra, unknown to the West. After surviving several adventures such as treacheries and robberies, he discovered it and returned to document it. The Victorian era coincided with the New Imperalism period of colonial expansion and the \"Scramble for Africa\" phenomenon. In that context, western colonial adventurers roamed the then-wilder portions of the world of Africa, the Middle East and the Americas; those were explorers, expeditioners, journalists, soldiers, spies, missionaries, archeologists, aviators, scentific investigators. Some of those individuals were not only heroic, but often polymaths who possessed diverge overlapping disciplines, and operated on a number of diverse but interconnected levels. One of the most exemplary of those figures was Sir Richard Francis Burton (1821 – 1890) who, inspired by Buckhardt's adventures, became famous for his explorations in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas, and the literary works he authored or translated. Another legendary figure was Dr. David Livingston, missionary and explorer; with the ambition to discover the sources of the Nile River, and stop the East African slave trade, he became the first European to cross south-central Africa, and led the Second Zambesi Expedition to examine the natural resources of southeastern Africa. Meanwhile, journalist Henry Morton Stanley organised an expedition to the Ottoman Empire, accompanied a force to Ethiopia to release British hostages, reported on a Battle in Abyssenia, and visited Persepolis in Iran, before famously \"rescuing\" Dr. Livingstone. He then led an exploration of central Africa. Dr. Livingstone's exploits influenced young Frederick Selous, who since his childhood dreamed of going to Africa and become a big game hunter. He became a celebrated hunter, conservationist, explorer, and British army officer, leading expeditions, contacting unknown tribes, and participating in the Matabele Wars. Selous, along with Frederick Russell Burnham became the inspiration for the archetypal action-adventure pulp hero: Allan Quatermain. In other parts of the world, in the turn of the century, Western adventurers explored and discovered fascinating remnants of \"lost\" civilizations all around the world: from the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, the ruins of mythical Troy in Turkey, Minoan palaces on Crete, Greece, and the remnants of the Assyrian empire. On the other side of the globe the \"lost city\" of Machu Picchu was found, as well as Mayan pyramids shrouded in the jungle. Such stories, and their finds captured the imagination of the public opinion, and wondered about the still-unexplored wild regions of the world and what they would hide. This gave rise to the \"Lost World\" genre of fiction. Father Abbé Charles-Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, a French priest, writer, ethnographer, historian, archaeologist. While a student he started writing essays in local folklore and historical accounts, gaining a reputation as a young writer and intellectual, although he always would be accused for plagiarisms and inaccuracies. After his ordination as a Catholic priest he made many travels to Central America as a missionary (1848). He was fascinated by the antiquities and little-understood monuments, and learned the history of the region (what was known then) and the indigenous languages. In 1864 he joined the French military expedition in Mexico as an archeologist. He published a history of the Aztec civilization, based on what was known/speculated about them, translated the mayan sacred text Popol Vuh, along an essay on mayan mythology and a grammar of the K'iche' dialect. In Madrid, he came across a copy of a manuscript written 300 years earlier by the Spanish cleric Diego de Landa, where he attempted to transcribe a \"Mayan alphabet\". Brasseur republished it, hoping that it would be the basis of deciphering the then-mysterious Mayan hieroglyphs. His work was significant in the preservation and divulgation of the language and history of the Aztecs and Mayans, but he was also responsible for fanciful theories... The first second half of the 20th century, the lines between science, spiritualism and mysticism was blurry. Many scientists, including archeologists and travelers, were superstitious; furthermore they weren't as much interested in accuracy, as leaving an impression with sensational stories. Some early theories were fueled by religious interpretations, as the Mesoamericans or the Pacific islanders were seen as the Lost Tribes of Israel. An early such figure can be found in the French antiquarian, artist and explorer Jean-Frédéric Maximilien de Waldeck (1766? – 1875) who valued his self-promotion and \"a good story\" more than truth. He lied about his place of birth and citizenship, claimed to be a noble (from Baron to Duke) and that he travelled to S. Africa and Egypt with Napoleon's expedition. While stıll in Europe he was hired to work on some engravings for an older report on Palenque. For some reason he chose to reproduce them fancifully with some Egyptian look. When he eventually left for Mexico, he participated in its exploration, making the ruins of Palenque, Mérida, Yucatán and Uxmal his home. His illustrations and architerctural reconstructions of the Aztec and Mayan ruins and sculptures followed the same philosophy of suggesting the connections between Mexico and Egypt. Father Brasseur had similar views: he perceived similarities between K'iche' Mayan and Old World languages; he thought that America was the origin of all languages, and Atlantis, a prehistoric advanced civilization, was the link of a trans-Atlantic contact. Brasseur also also believed that the Mayans continued the lost culture of Atlantis and sought a common link between Egyptian and Mayan mythologies. Using Mayan historiography he wrote a speculative history of Atlantis. The two, Brasseur and Waldeck \"met\" when the latter's illustrations accompanied the former's texts. This time Waldeck's reconstructions were embelished with Greco-Roman influences (and the way he adapted the mayan scripts he erroneously included heads of elephants). One more influence from Brasseur came after examining an old codex which he identified as Mayan. In his tentative attempts of translation (partially \"helped\" by the innacurate de Landa's alphabet) he identified the name \"MU\". In his last article (1872) he advanced the theory that shifts of the Earth's axis resulted to four cataclysmic periods from 10,500 BC. In 1908 the Church of England appointed Frederick Bligh Bond director of excavations at Glastonbury Abbey. Bond was a Freemason and member of the Theosophical Society and the Society for Psychical Research. He claimed that the retired navy Captain \"John Alleyne\" contacted dead monks and the builder of the Edgar Chapel at Glastonbury, who advised him where to excavate, discovering the nature and dimensions of some buildings. The Church strongly disapproved of spiritualism and Bishop Armitage Robinson dismissed him in 1921. In the early 1920s the Bolshevik Gleb Bokii (chief cryptographer and officer of the Soviet secret police), was inspired by Theosophical teachings and Tibetan traditions and experimented with Buddhist spiritual techniques for \"engineering perfect communist human beings\". With his friend Alexander Barchenko, a writer and researcher of \"anomalous phenomena\", known for his researchings of Hyperborea in Russian Far East, they embarked on a quest for the mythical realm of Shambhala to retrieve its wisdom. Intrigues within the Soviet intelligence service put an end to the expeditions, while the Foreign Commissariat sent its own expedition to Tibet in 1924. F.A. Mitchell-Hedges was a famous but controversial adventurist. In Mexico he was captured by Pancho Villa and worked as a spy. His curiosity for travel and discovery grew because of his interest in the lost city of Atlantis. He considered the Bay Islands of Hondoura the remnants of Atlantis, and that the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua was the \"cradle of civilization\". His finds are in question, and his most controversial, about which he is most famous, is the Crystal Skull of Doom; his daughter claimed that she discovered it in 1924 in a Mayan temple in Lubaantun, under a collapsed altar (documental evidence suggested that her father bought it much later from an art dealer); the adventurer claimed that it was more than 3.600 years old and had supernatural powers in the hands of a Mayan priest. Cosplayers might wear more impractical and period-specific accessories pointing to the Victorian or interwar era such as: There is no music closely associated to the adventurous pulp genre, however the soundtracks of the above media can contribute. The Indiana Jones soundtrack for example is characterized by uplifting marches and fanfares. Tribal and ethnic music can also give further shape to the aesthetic. Querying YouTube keywords such as \"lost world temple jungle adventure music\" can yield interesting results. Both the historical figures who originated the aesthetic, and the characters of adventure pulp fiction are polyglots and polymaths with a rich background from academia to hard adventuring and survivalism. The character of Doc Savage, a typical pulp hero, fits the competent man archetype: he can pilot an airplane, survive in the jungle, decipher Mayan hieroglyphs, communicate with an uncontacted Amazon tribe, even foil the plans of an evil Nazi or Soviet scientist. As a result the \"adventure pulp\"-related hobbies can be widely diverse, from scholarship to the extreme outdoors. Please note that those lists greatly overlap, and titles are repeated between each other. Perhaps a more concise list should be made.",

Since Adventurecore is such a broad aesthetic the standards of fashion are flexible and can be difficult to discern from contemporary fashion. Here it has been sorted into three distinct categories. Associated with daily life, Stylistic Adventurecore is more based on presentation than practical activities. Practical Adventurecore is more suited for camping, hiking, and outdoor travel, with specialized clothing and equipment to help navigate through the elements. Both practical and stylish!

This movement emerged during the aftermath of World War I, reflecting the Futurists fascination with aviation and the transformative power of modern technology; which became one of the most important and newest topics in post-war Italian art. \nThe artists of the Aeropittura art movement sought to create an aesthetic that featured the most interesting elements of the new technologies of the time, particularly focusing on aeroplanes. Aeropittura art usually experimented with key elements like dynamism, speed and the portrayal of flight in their art; trying to make their static paintings look like they're moving[1]. So, Aeropittura is often portrayed from the \"point of view of a bird\", creating a sense of vertigo. \nAeropittura became officially an art movement in its own right when a group of eight Italian artists published the Perspectives of Flight in 1929, which was the manifesto of the Aeropittura art movement and its general ideas. That group of artists included; Benedetta Cappa, Fortunato Depero, Gerardo Dottori, Fillìa, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Enrico Prampolini, Mino Somenzi and Tato.  \nThe term Aeropittura is a combination of the Italian words aero (from aeroplano; airplane) and pittura (painting). Some visuals prominent in Aeropittura included: Aeropittura had a major focus on technology and aviation; which aligned with the Italian fascists' interests of militarizing, modernization and promoting extreme Italian nationalism in the country, just like the Futurism movement as a whole. Therefore, various Aeropittura artists considered themselves fascists and actively collaborated with the fascist regime, producing propagandandistic artworks that glorified politicians and dictators like Benito Mussolini or military factions like the Italian Air Force. Some artworks also were meant to persuade people into Catholicism. This has led to the art movement getting discredited for its heavy association with fascism, and some argue that it was purely a tool of propaganda; although not all Aeropittura artists were necessarily fascists. For example, some Aeropittura artworks were actually used as a way to express a sense of discontent with the regime and criticize it.",

According to Aestheticism, art should be produced to be beautiful, rather than to teach a lesson, create a parallel, or perform another didactic purpose, a sentiment best illustrated by the slogan \"art for art's sake.\" Aestheticism originated in 1860s England with a radical group of artists and designers, including William Morris and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. It flourished in the 1870s and 1880s, gaining prominence and the support of notable writers such as Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde. Aestheticism challenged the values of mainstream Victorian culture, as many Victorians believed that literature and art fulfilled important ethical roles. Writing in The Guardian, Fiona McCarthy states that \"the aesthetic movement stood in stark and sometimes shocking contrast to the crass materialism of Britain in the 19th century.\" Aestheticism was named by the critic Walter Hamilton in The Aesthetic Movement in England in 1882. By the 1890s, decadence, a term with origins in common with aestheticism, was in use across Europe. Aestheticism has its roots in German Romanticism. Though the term \"aesthetic\" derives from Greek, Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten's Aesthetica (1750) made important use of it in German before Immanuel Kant incorporated it into his philosophy in the Critique of Judgment (1790). Kant, in turn, influenced Friedrich Schiller's Aesthetic Letters (1794) and his concept of art as Spiel (Play): \"Man is never so serious as when he plays; man is wholly man only when he plays\". In the Letters, Schiller proclaimed salvation through art: These ideas were imported to the English-speaking world largely through the efforts of Thomas Carlyle, whose Life of Friedrich Schiller (1825), Critical and Miscellaneous Essays and Sartor Resartus (1833–34) introduced and advocated aestheticism while also, if not marking the earliest use of the word \"aesthetic\" in the English language, certainly popularising it. Ruth apRoberts declared him the \"apostle of aesthetics in England, 1825-27\", in recognition of his pioneering influence on the subsequent development of the aesthetic movement.",

We aimed for this fusion of 19th-century silhouettes with African culture.....\" He refers to the look as “Afro-Victorian,” adding: “In the world of fantastical, the story worked on such a completing human level that we really wanted to reach out to audiences and offer them something very appealing and modern.”- Michael Wilkinson, Women's Wear Daily, November 13, 2020[1] The term Afro-Victorian was coined by costume designer Michael Wilkinson, when designing the aesthetic for Netflix holiday musical \"Jingle Jangle\". \"My concept was to create eye-catching Victorian-era silhouettes accented by fabrics from African cultures and countries. It was a constant balancing act to juxtapose the old and the new – even though our story is set in the 19th century, the music and the choreography is very modern, and we wanted to make sure the costumes appealed to contemporary audiences. Again, color was important here – David reminded me that history wasn’t in black and white and sepia – it was in COLOR!\" - Michael Wilkinson, Awards Daily, February 18, 2021 Even though the term was first introduced to the public by Wilkinson in 2020, the style could be found in the works of artist Yinka Shonibare,  the photos of photographer Tamary Kudita and in the style of the Herero women of Namibia. Yinka Shonibare CBE RA was born in 1962 in London, UK. He studied Fine Art at Byam School of Art, London (now Central Saint Martins College) in 1989 and received his MFA from Goldsmiths, University of London in 1991. Shonibare’s interdisciplinary practice uses citations of Western art history and literature to question the validity of contemporary cultural and national identities within the context of globalization. His trademark material is the brightly colored Dutch wax batik fabric he buys in London. This fabric was inspired by Indonesian design, mass-produced by the Dutch and eventually sold to the colonies in West Africa. In the 1960s, the material became a new symbol of African identity and independence.[2] A product of dual heritage, Tamary Kudita was born in Zimbabwe while her ancestry can be traced back to the Orange Free State, the Boer republic in Southern Africa. She received a BA in Fine Art at Michaelis School of Fine Art at the University of Cape Town and quickly established herself as a fine art photographer with exhibitions in Zimbabwe and abroad. Kudita's investigations into the legacy and impact of colonialism on the family structure has resulted in exhibitions delving into the history of the Post-colonial identity, race, and representation.[3] Their style of dressing was influenced by the wives of German missionaries and colonialists who first came to the country in the early 1900s. The long dresses are heavy and reflect the style of the Victorian period with numerous petticoats worn to add fullness to their skirts. They are hand-sewn by the women who add their own personal style and flair. According to Tim Henshall, a British tour operator who has visited the region for nearly two decades and gotten to know some of the women, the headdress is “built to represent the horns of the cattle, which are so important to the Himba and Herero communities.” “The Germans in Namibia brought people in to work for them so they took the local communities and gave them work in their houses and on their land,” said Henshall, who runs Kamili Safaris. “Instead of the Herero being topless and barely covered, which would offend the modest attitudes of Victorians at the time, they wanted them to be covered up,” he added. Henshall added that the women showed no sign of being bothered by wearing the outfits, even in Namibia’s tropical climate. The Herero women take enormous pride in their outfits and have also developed a sideline in making and selling dolls wearing exact replicas of the dresses to tourists.[4] External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

Afrofuturism is one of the rare aesthetics that can encompass the visual medium, fashion, the written word, and music, and tackles themes such as feminism, alienation from your people, the grotesque, water symbolism, and reclamation of one's identity through their roots. Afrofuturist thought is probably what inspired the initial push for the Art Hoe movement. Probably the most popular example of Afrofuturism in popular culture right now is Black Panther. Afrofuturist music is said to have its roots in the late 1950s thanks to jazz musician Herman Poole Blount (better known as Sun Ra), and continued the tradition with funk musician George Clinton, legendary rock star Jimi Hendrix, rapper Missy Elliot, and even modern artists like Janelle Monáe, Rihanna, Kid Cudi, Busta Rhymes, Outkast (especially Andre 3000), and even Beyoncé to a lesser extent exhibit elements of the Afrofuturist aesthetics and philosophy. It is here that Afrofuturism is probably best known to the layperson in terms of its offering, considering many artists in the Afrofuturist school have become bona fide musical legends. The Afrofuturist aesthetic takes common science fiction elements and mixes in African traditions and fashion with it; the best-known example of Afrofuturism is Black Panther (which has, indeed, led to Afrofuturism entering into mainstream discussion and is noteworthy for having a predominantly black cast and crew). Possibly the earliest visual work of Afrofuturism is actually none other than the legendary science fiction series Star Trek thanks to the character of Nyota Uhura (played by Nichelle Nichols), the communications officer of the USS Enterprise. A popular story told about Star Trek is Nichelle Nichols being encouraged by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to stay on the show because of how important her role on the show was to portraying a more positive future for the African American community at the time, saying: When she told this to series creator Gene Roddenberry, he replied simply with \"Finally, someone gets it.\" Other visual works of Afrofuturism include the Blade trilogy, Space is the Place (starring Sun Ra), and A Wrinkle in Time, as well as the paintings of artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Angelbert Metoyer, Sheeba Maya, Manzel Bowman, and Mshindo Kuumba. Afrofuturist fashion draws very heavily upon traditional African prints and colors and adapts them to more modern and fashion-forward clothing styles to create a distinctly African identity, often looking like a real life super hero in the process (but don't confuse the two, please; Afrofuturist fashion is a form of self-expression, not an attempt for them to become vigilantes). In the 70s, American soul and funk artists adopted a quasi-futuristic, androgynous style similar to British Glam Rock but often with heavier metallic fabrics and accessories. (Artists like James Brown, George Clinton, and Sly and the Family Stone are key examples of this.) In the 80s, artists like Grace Jones and Afrika Bambaataa furthered this aesthetic in their own distinctly creative ways. While some Afrofuturists can draw explicitly from their particular tribal history for their fashion aesthetics, others (who may not be as well-versed in their national and tribal history; a common occurrence in African Americans due to the vast majority having their ancestors forced over to the States via the slave trade) are sort of left to their own devices and try to get the best approximation of their cultural heritage that they can be based on the traits of the different African tribes, which can lead to some absolutely breathtaking fashion that could, very well, be the future of fashion. One particular piece of advice for creating one's own Afrofuturist fashion is \"Listen to your spirit\". There are many examples of Afrofuturist fiction out there; the works of Octavia Butler have long been associated (albeit controversially) with the Afrofuturist movement, but many point to the Ralph Ellison novel Invisible Man, released in 1952, as being the earliest example of Afrofuturist fiction. Many works from W.E.B. Du Bois, Charles W. Chesnutt, and George S. Schuyler are often cited as works of Afrofuturism. Perhaps the most famous example of it in writing, again, goes back to Black Panther in Marvel Comics, where the fictional nation of Wakanda (the home of the titular hero) was depicted as being the most technologically-advanced nation in the world thanks to the country lying on top of vast quantities of Vibranium (an incredibly valuable metal in the Marvel universe) thanks to a meteorite crashing into the area in the distant past. Other comic books and characters of importance include Blade (whose style is now admittedly more influenced by Trad Goth culture) and Cyborg of The New Teen Titans.

After Hours isn’t defined in terms of a specific artstyle or media, but instead by the imagery of various abandoned places such as empty streets, schools, and parks. However, the aesthetic is not limited to physical settings either; online settings such as abandoned blogs, empty game servers, and inactive websites can also elicit similar feelings. The concept is built on the contrast between the memories or expectations associated with a place and the current reality of it being abandoned or devoid of human presence. These feelings, which have collectively been coined as kenopsia, include a mix of nostalgia, melancholy, and a sense of surrealism. The emptiness of the abandoned space and the remains of its former vitality can create a powerful emotional response. For some, it might cause them to reflect on the passage of time, the transience of life, or the impermanence of human activities. The always-present tranquility of After Hours distinguishes it from the adjacent aesthetic of Liminal Space, which is intentionally designed to be unsettling and foreboding.[1] Several people who identify with this aesthetic like to explore such places, while others - such as graveyard shift workers - have no option but to be active during night. These night-crawlers love silence and quiet settings. Being away from everyone and everything is comforting to them. The aesthetic is commonly seen in Post-Apocalyptic media to convey the effects of the world becoming empty. Sometime about March 29th, 2015, John Koenig coined kenopsia for his online project, The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows.[2][3][4][5] Visuals for After Hours tend to be dimly lit public areas usually bustling with people, but are shown as empty. Photos usually have streetlights that are on 24/7 as the rest of the street is dark and lifeless. Unlike the Liminal Space aesthetic, these empty areas are not always intended to be unsettling; rather, they are supposed to invoke a feeling of rebelliousness and tranquility. To people that participate in this aesthetic, the late hours are mysterious and contemplative, a moment filled with the imagery of light poles, shady corners, clocks, trash blowing, quiet urban scenery, wanderers and cat's eyes lurking. The visuals associated often convey a haunting and surreal atmosphere. When exploring abandoned or empty spaces or locations, certain visual elements tend to be highlighted. These visual elements can include decay, emptiness, silence, nostalgia, and stillness. Often these evoke feelings of despair or uneasiness. Anything with these characteristics is usually identified as evoking kenopsia. Often these things are also related to liminal spaces, so there is crossover in that regard. After Hours activities usually involve interacting with empty public areas; whether it be traveling through or waiting for someone that may never come. Some activities related to After Hours are illegal or dangerous and will vary according to the urban area where it takes place. These include: Kenopsia has inspired various forms of media, including photography, literature, film, and art, where creators capture and convey the unique atmosphere associated with abandoned or desolate spaces. Some examples that utilize kenopsia include: As an aesthetic based heavily on ambient, ambient-based, and adjacent music genres can be seen as complementary to this aesthetic. There are many ways one can communicate the feeling of kenopsia and some do through music by evoking feelings of emptiness, nostalgia, or solitude, similar associated things.

Colloquially it refers to dark western styles such as Punk, Grunge, Emo, etc though the true meaning includes a wide range of darker and lighter styles from all cultures. Sometimes, if a subculture is particularly popular (rock is an example of this), alternative rock would be its own sub-genre outside of 'mainstream' rock. It is important to note that most aesthetics could fall under the alternative label nowadays. Additionally, the line between alternative and mainstream is becoming very blurred due to the power of the internet in promoting \"underground\" artists. Alternative originated as a genre of music, described by Merriam-Webster as \"music that is produced by performers who are outside the musical mainstream, that is typically regarded as more eclectic, original, or challenging than most popular music (such as conventional rock, pop, or country), and that is often distributed by independent record labels.\" Due to this, in music terms, alternative and indie (independent) have similar connotations, indie meaning not associated with a mainstream record label. It is important to note that \"indie\" is not a specific sound, it better describes the way the sound is released. Alternative rock is the most popular genre of alternative music, and is what most people think of when alternative is mentioned. Alternative rock gained most of its popularity from 1991 to 1997 in the wake of Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", as described in this article. The title \"alternative\" has developed to often be used as a label for clothing that is outside current fashion trends. The label \"alt\" is also being used a lot on TikTok to describe fashion that doesn't fit into other categories. Alternative originated in the 1960s, when Rock was one of the most popular genres of music, with artists such as The Rolling Stones. Alternative rock differed to this, and could be said to have started when Velvet Underground first got together in 1965, as this article states. Alternative music most often aims to sound different to whatever the current popular music model is. Some claim that the origin of Alternative Rock can be traced down to The Velvet Underground's album \"The Velvet Underground & Nico\". Genres featured within this album include art rock, punk, garage, shoegazing, goth, and indie. Alternative rap and hip-hop started around the late 1980s when artists such as De La Soul began to create hip-hop music that was influenced by multiple genres. Some genres that often featured in alternative hip-hop were jazz, pop, rock, funk, and soul. Alternative rap gained more popularity around the 1990s. The sound of alternative rap made a return with Kanye West and Childish Gambino. Alternative rap/ hip hop emphasizes musical elements, more so than \"gangsta rap.\" Alternative Country - or outlaw country - is more linked to Cowpunk. Since alternative culture is built around alternative and independent artists, supporting small artists is a large part of alternative subculture. Followers of alternative culture generally choose to support individual artists over larger companies whenever they can. Additionally, since alternative celebrates what is outside the mainstream, alternative people are supportive of marginalized people who are often seen as \"not normal\", people who are often attacked by the mainstream media. Alternative people also support other subcultures that are seen as \"weird\" by the mainstream, such as furries and cosplayers. Overall, members of alternative culture tend to have left leaning views. One reason for this is because they support individual artists and often steer clear of big producers where possible. Alternative music often covers themes and political views that mainstream culture avoids, such as Radiohead's 'OK Human,' which addresses a world, \"fraught with rampant consumerism, social alienation, emotional isolation and political malaise.\" Artists (Alt-R&B) Alternative fashion is similar to that of punk and goth. Music is the central element, while fashion and visuals are optional. However, the label \"alternative fashion\" has evolved to mean any fashion outside of the mainstream. When most people think of alternative fashion, they think of Punk, Goth, or Emo fashion. Although alternative fashion is often a combination of these styles, it is not limited to them. For instance, Fairy Kei could be considered alternative fashion since it is outside the mainstream. The alternative community generally supports small artists, and this sentiment often mirrored in the fashion, with places like Etsy and small businesses being good places to shop for alternative clothes. Thrifting is also encouraged, along with DIY. External links to help you better understand alternative aesthetic: Vendors",

There is considerable disagreement over what counts as \"American\" because vast differences exist between different regions and subcultures within American society. For example, most people would put Jazz or Hip-Hop aesthetics in separate categories from Americana, despite both genres being uniquely American in their origins, promulgation, and current praxis. Similarly, Juggalos and the Amish do not fall under the \"Americana\" umbrella, though Yeehaw might. Much of the aesthetic is characterized by nostalgia for an idealized past, often seen as \"more wholesome\" than modern American culture and style. The aesthetic is often commercialized: restaurant chains such as Red Robin and Applebee's decorate their interior walls with a collection of mid-20th century artifacts and signage which is affectionately known as \"Americana clutter\". Individualism is a social theory favoring freedom of action for individuals over collective or state control. Freedom is a strongly tied conviction present throughout America but especially the south. America is known as the \"Land of the Free\" due to freedom of religion, speech, press, opportunity, etc. These motifs were founded in the early years of America when those were relatively unheard of, and thus are deeply ingrained in the national consciousness. Hard work is seen as the only way to achieve success. Local community provides a sense of security and stability. These people share the same family background, culture, religion, and values. Americans as a whole share a national identity, encounter the same media and have a knowledge of history that creates a general aesthetic that applies to the nation as a whole. While many Americans may not like the aesthetic, they will mutually agree on its Americanness. Examples include: Greasers are a youth subculture that was popularized in the 1950s to 1960s by predominantly working class and lower class teenagers and young adults in the United States. The subculture remained prominent into the mid-1960s and was particularly embraced by certain ethnic groups in urban areas, particularly Italian- and Hispanic-Americans. Route 66 was named after historic U.S. Route 66, the first interstate highway to connect the East and West Coasts of the United States, this aesthetic is centered on classic American car culture. Though it is primarily a visual aesthetic, it is often associated with classic rock 'n' roll tunes from the 1950s. American car enthusiasts may also be referred to as gearheads. This subgenre of the Americana aesthetic often overlaps with Greaser and hot-rod culture (a.k.a. Kustom Kulture). Okies are residents, native, or cultural descendants of Oklahoma. During the 1930s, Californians referred to migrant Midwestern farmworkers as \"Okies\", who were refugee farm families from the Southern Plains who migrated to California to escape the ruin of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. In James Blish's Cities in Flight science fiction series, the term \"Okie\" was applied in a similar context to entire cities that, thanks to an anti-gravity device, take flight to the stars to escape an economic collapse on Earth. Working as a migrant labor force, these cities act as cultural pollinators, spreading technology and knowledge throughout the expanding human civilization. The later novels focus on the travels of New York City as one such Okie city, though there are many others. The Redneck or Hillbilly aesthetic is concentrated on the rural poor from Southeastern United States with a strong emphasis on traditional values and the simple life. Terms like White Trash, Cracker, and Hick are also associated with this aesthetic, however these terms (including Redneck) are considered derogatory. The term redneck originated from 1893, coming from the sunburn often seen on farmers. Because of the large amount of rural land and short, subdued winters, colonists naturally chose the southeast for farming. The large, rolling hills also gave way to animal farms and became one of the key images associated to the southern aesthetic. An ever-present stereotype of rednecks is racism and the confederacy. While many redneck types may be racist, not all of them are, and it is harmful to stereotype them all as such. Although Rednecks are associated with the South and the Confederacy, they should not be confused with the wealthy plantation owners of 19th century and Southern Belle culture. American writer and historian James Truslow Adams described the American Dream in 1931 as \"life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement [or economic situation]\". This idea is from the Declaration of Independence, which professes that all men are created equal. The \"American Dream\" has changed over the decades and centuries. In the 1700s the first American ideal was frontierism. Also called expansionism was the expansion of American territories into official, U.S. States. This was an age of mass migration and settlements with an attitude called \"Manifest Destiny\". Many Europeans were enticed by free land, and immigrated over to the States. This combination of many European cultures made America a \"melting pot\" of culture. This is also linked to the Western and Prairie aesthetic. For more information, see the American Pioneers page. The discovery of Californian gold in 1849 brought about a whole new American Dream, although it still was influenced by frontierism. This is also linked to the Western aesthetic. The post World War Two era brought about a new era of consumerism and national pride. Women went back into traditional roles as homemakers, while men returned to being the main breadwinners. Technological advances such as washing machines, blenders, electric toasters, and televisions modernized the lives of the expanding middle class. Due to the Baby Boom, child and family friendly restaurants, hotels, and theme parks like Disneyland, enjoyed huge success. The term \"teenager\" was also used for the first time in the 1950s. Also see Diner and Atompunk. Women's fashion and gender expectations from this time period heavily influenced the Tradwife movement.",

While visuals vary, the main visual of Analog Horror consists of old styled footage with glitchy, static effects. A majority of TV Broadcast or commercial analogs usually contain a deep blue color palette or a blank background of any color. They also contain a schedule of shows that are going to be broadcasted and display the time, which usually take place between 12 AM - 5 AM. Distorted, warped and blackened faces are another common reoccurring visual. These faces are often heavily shadowed and use the \"sharpen\" effect. The faces also display twisted, sinister and unnatural expressions and contain extremely detailed features. Space imagery also appears in many Analog Horror videos, often in a sinister light, such as the planets and moon in Gemini Home Entertainment and Local 58. While not music-based, there is an amount of songs and artists that can fit into the analog horror aesthetic. They usually include alternative-type songs with a darker beat. Songs from the early 1900s are also used as they can be nostalgic and unsettling.",

The boundaries of the period are set by the beginning of the dynastic monarchs (pharaohs) who ruled Egypt and Rome's conquest of Egypt. The aesthetics of Ancient Egypt have influenced art and design for thousands of years. In recent centuries it was most prominent during the Victorian Era through the Egyptian Revival style in design and architecture, due to early archeology in Egypt. In the 1920s, after Howard Carter and his team opened the tomb of King Tutankhamun (King Tut), Egyptian art influenced the Art Deco movement, causing an 'Egyptomania'. There were revivals of the aesthetic of Ancient Egypt during the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. Architecture and objects in this style are called \"Neo-Egyptian\" or \"Egyptian Revival\". The style was popular mainly at the beginning of the 19th century, due to Napoleon Bonaparte's attempt to conquer Egypt, which led to an international Egyptomania. During this period, Neoclassicism (a movement that tries to revive Greco-Roman art), more specifically the Empire style, was the mainstream aesthetic. Because of this, some mixes of Neoclassicism and Egyptian Revival were created. An example of an Egyptian Revival structure is the Egyptian entrance of the Hôtel Beauharnais in Paris, circa 1804, L.E.N. Bataille. Later in the 19th century, some Academic artists made history paintings with scenes from Ancient Egypt, like The Egyptian Widow from 1872 by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, or Cleopatra Testing Poisons on Condemned Prisoners from 1887 by Alexandre Cabanel. The style had another wave or popularity in the 1920s, thanks to the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamen, opened in November 1922. Because of this, there are some examples of 1920s and 1930s Art Deco mixed with Neo-Egyptian motifs. The aesthetic of Ancient Egypt mixed well with Art Deco due to the fact that both use simplified motifs, geometric shapes, symmetry and repetition. The combinations of intense colours found in Ancient Egyptian jewellery were reused in the 1920s. Ancient Egypt is a popular setting for fantasy films, especially those involving time travel and magic. Supernatural and horror movies make use of the \"Mummy's Curse\" trope.

Androgyny in terms of clothing style may be expressed without regard to biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual identity. Androgynous-based visual aesthetics, as in the explanation above, are a merging of female and male stereotypical styles. As a style aesthetic, it has existed for a very long time, as far back as the late Victorian period which saw the rise of Dandies (a group of extraordinarily well-dressed men) and women like George Sand who preferred to wear men’s clothing (much like Marlene Dietrich later famously would on film). Women found it easier to be accepted wearing “male” clothing, particularly when Levi’s began putting out jeans specifically for women in the 50s. This instantly broadened the ideas of women wearing men’s clothing beyond the fringe early feminism it had originated in. In the late 60s, Dandism for men had a resurgence, incorporating in it what had become (but in the Victorian era, were not) stereotypically “feminine” styles such as ruffles, lace, velvet, and vibrant colors. Meanwhile, pantsuits were slowly being incorporated into women’s work wear. By the early 70s, Britain had a wildly rebellious insurgence of young men who, influenced by  neo-Dandism, went a step further to create Glam Rock. Men wore makeup and grew their hair long or teased it. They dressed in semi-dress-like (but still tailored to the male form) kimonos and tunics, a profusion of sequins and glitter, intricate bodysuits, items of jewelry (particularly bangles), and much more. This aesthetic was almost completely dominated by both straight and gay men and very few women in the scene dressed this way (except the likes of Suzy Quatro). It wasn’t until the late 70s that women rediscovered androgyny again, both in Britain and around the world. In America, a somewhat similar style was seen in 70s Disco, funk, and soul. Many of these typically male musicians adopted quasi-futuristic one-piece ensembles that glittered and shimmered as much as Glam Rock did. They weren’t known for wearing makeup, but did embrace jewelry and platform boots. The American and British Punk and New Wave movements made it possible for women, regardless of whether straight or lesbian, to try more masculine clothing. Artists like Patti Smith, Joan Jett, and Siouxsie Sioux (in her earlier days) were some of the first women in these scenes to pioneer this. By the 80s, women went a step further by cutting their hair short and decking themselves out in suits, with or without makeup (like Annie Lennox, Grace Jones, and Laurie Anderson). Early Post-Punk and Goth girls were much the same, adopting “masculine” items like leather jackets and short hair. In Britain during this time, a scene developed out of the ashes of Glam Rock and inspired by David Bowie: New Romantic. Perhaps the only completely androgynous fashion scene, the adherents of this style were limitless in their expression regardless of their sexuality. Men could be more subtle and wear lipstick with vibrantly-colored suits (like Japan the Band and Duran Duran) or deck themselves out in more costume-esque, Rococopunk regalia (like Visage and Adam and the Ants). Unlike in Glam Rock, women in the New Romantic and Synthpop scenes were seen to have the exact same freedom in their clothing as the men did. They could be subtle simply by cutting their hair into a spiky crop or by going all out and wearing a suit and tie. American pop music also embraced this thanks to the work of Prince, who moved from wearing Speedos to purple glitter, lace, eyeliner, and platform boots. Even Michael Jackson began to be drawn into the lure of shimmer and ruffles. (This was likely the effect that the glamour of 70s Disco continued to have.) The Deathrock and Goth scenes also showed a profusion of androgyny. Straight and gay men could (and in some clubs, still can) be seen in makeup, teased hair, fishnets, black beads, and even semi-deconstructed dresses (like Ollie Wisdom of Specimen or Rozz Williams of Christian Death). Women wore much the same kind of clothes and makeup, equally regardless of their sexuality. Hair Metal was the last of the West’s truly androgynous scenes, which in itself was a visual hybrid of Metal and Glam Rock. The hair was typically long and heavily teased, smudged eyeliner was the main makeup, accessories such as bangles and layered necklaces was used, and these were contrasted with motorcycle leather and tight jeans. As androgyny for men began to fade away in the West, it was adopted by Japan. Directly inspired by Deathrock, New Romantic, Hair Metal, and Synthpop’s stylistic freedom (as well as their homegrown Goth scene), they wore exaggerated, costume-esque clothing. This typically included ruffles, lace, beaded jackets, and a profusion of makeup with shockingly transformative effect. Once again, this was a straight and gay men-dominated scene, and many women who came to Visual Kei soon gravitated towards Gothic Lolita (though to be fair, so did many of the men, such as Malice Mizer’s Mana). J-Pop became a tamed version of this, influenced by the ever ambiguous Gakct’s leaving the Visual Kei scene. These men often dressed (and wore subtle makeup) to further resemble Shoujo manga’s softer take on “bishounen”, manga art of young men with effeminate faces and male bodies. Much of modern bishounen art itself can be seen to have roots in New Romantic (thanks to the influence of Japan the Band and Duran Duran), Goth (artists like Bauhaus and Gene Loves Jezebel), and David Bowie himself, whether in his Glam Rock or Synthpop phases. J-Pop’s influence spread to K-Pop, which openly adopted much of their clothing, hair styles, and (subtle) makeup. Khonmiman (or “flower boys”) became a revolutionary movement in South Korea that grew out of K-Pop’s influence and has given men in their country the freedom to wear makeup and androgynous (though not specifically traditionally “feminine”) clothing without censure. Meanwhile, while in most of the West men are discouraged from androgyny (not realizing that it is very different from transvestism and drag), women in both the straight and gay communities have been free to dress in more traditionally “masculine” styles. This is not looked down upon and is in fact romanticized by the (equally harmful) stereotypes touting the superiority of Tomboys to so-called girly-girls. It is also interesting to note that the most openly androgynous fashion movements have had very little to do with gender politics. This was particularly seen in the early 80s, a rare time when both straight and gay individuals were able to express themselves without any necessary interest in social-political issues outside of their movement. New Romantics, Goths, and even the preceding Glam Rockers wore whatever they thought looked cool, regardless of societal norms or their own sexual preferences. Androgynous people dress or style themselves to look neither typically male nor female. The goal of dressing androgynously (on purpose) is to have an ambiguous gender appearance - where people don't automatically assume that you're male or female because it is difficult to know. This being said, biological sex does play a part in dressing androgynously - AFAB people dress typically more traditionally masculine and AMAB people typically dress more traditionally feminine. To reiterate, the androgynous aesthetic is not a gender identity, rather it is a form of dress. It’s a hybrid style of traditionally masculine and feminine clothing, makeup, and hair. The point is not to look like the opposite gender but to merge qualities of both in the style. It isn’t completely either, and has a history of being worn by straight people just as often as those in the gay community. (It’s also worn around the world by people of every race, culture, and creed.) Historically, both men and women have indulged in wearing makeup, dying their hair, accents like ruffles and puffed sleeves, accessories like bracelets and necklaces, short and long hair cuts, tights/hose, pastels and the color pink, wearing suits, and wearing tunics, robes kimonos, or kilts. In truth, fashion and style has been notoriously fickle for centuries. Regardless, it’s important to remember that not everything is flattering to everyone in terms of clothing. Tailoring and accentuating the natural lines of the body is usually what makes an androgynous style that is well-balanced between genders. (It’s also important to note that being LGBTQ is not necessary to wear androgynous clothing, hair, or makeup. It’s a movement without bounds in gender or sexuality.) Some 'androgynous fashion staples' would be things such as External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic. Androgynous is not a music-based aesthetic, but there are plenty of artists and songs that include themes of androgyny.",

It is very similar in vibe with the Rococo style of the 18th century. Some of the old paintings with cherubs you find on Pinterest are Rococo. The aesthetic is designed to emulate the same unearthly beauty that the European stereotype of angels are described and depicted with, though it can also include non-European angel aesthetics. This can be done with modern or older presentation methods. It’s also worth noting that much of the angel mythology and imagery comes from multiple belief systems (from Greek paganism, to Judaism, to New Age, to the aforementioned Christianity). So there are no specific religious connections or connotations involved in an angelic aesthetic. There is also an entirely Angelcore store in the Montmartre district of Paris, called La Boutique des Anges, Rue Yvonne le Tac no. 2. There are all kinds of designs with angels, mainly figures. As an aesthetic based heavily on feeling, ambient-based and adjacent music genres can be seen as complementary to this aesthetic. Folk and classic piano are also popular. The difference between cherubs (aka putti, singular putto) and angels are enough to warrant its own tag on various social media websites most notably Tumblr. Cherubcore focuses on the feelings and values portrayed by heavenly cherubs and the small, sweet, baby-like innocence of the figures that differ from the divine essence of angels. There is often a distinct crossover in this aesthetic with Babycore and Delicate Sweet, with a hint of Lovecore now and then due to the similarity between cherubs and the mythical figure Cupid. The visuals of cherubcore are the same as angelcore but add more fun visuals like candy, cherubs laughing in paintings, hearts, porcelain figures, and child's toys. There are lots of pinks and whites involved as well. Fashion has a very similar overlap to Coquette(especially gloomy coquette), and Babycore, with youthful and childlike articles of clothing and accessories. It is worth mentioning that the baby angels portrayed as cherubs in art and in this aesthetic are based off of ancient greaco-Roman putti associated with the god Eros/Cupid, and not on the actual biblical portrayal of cherubs which is vastly different. The Fallen Angel aesthetic, also known as dark/goth angelcore, takes angelcore and adds more somber themes and dark visual tones while still providing the essences of ethereal and other-worldy. Many of the themes of fallen angel involve feelings of \"falling from grace\" or unworthiness/not wanting to be placed on a pedestal like angels are commonly portrayed. The aesthetic itself can both exude feelings of peace and radiance or sorrow and malice depending on the camp presented. Common motifs for fallen angels include angel statues, black wings, flowing white and/or black fabrics, fire, halos, horns and tails, the sky and the ground, snakes, and much more. Visually, there is a crossover with Dark Naturalism, which exhibits dark, misty visuals of nature. Other visuals can overlap with Traumacore and Grunge, employing angelic motifs mixed with heavy melancholy themes. Fashion takes regular angelcore and turns it black, almost gothic. It can also take an aforementioned Grunge route. This aesthetic can focus on criticizing the Catholic religion, sharing similar aspects of reasoning with Sacricore. Common topics include excommunication, religious trauma, and mental illness. Often this is mixed with the aforementioned feelings of falling from grace or feeling tainted, and potentially being cast out of a religion or choosing to leave it. Biblical Angels are taken from the biblical depiction of angels, rather than the altered humanistic version created by the media. There are various sections of the Bible where angels and cherubs are described, including Ezekiel 1:5-11, Isaiah 6:2, Job 38:7, Ps 8:5, Ac 26:13, and Re 1:20. These verses and many others describe angels as hot, pure energy, and frightening to humans. This is a popular subject in art and can be seen across media. Often times they are depicted as half human, half animal or as energy balls with a thousand eyes circling around it with six wings. This subject focuses on the reality of divinity and the terrifying truth that had been covered up by mainstream society over history. The overall theme of the biblical angel aesthetic is questioning monstrosity and fear, and presenting truth to those living in ignorance. It is both ethereal and horrifying, and has a subcommunity for those who identify with these depictions. These communities also use their art of biblical angels to portray the previously mention themes, as well as humor. Being ethereal and mysterious, feeling \"too big your body\", and a deep philosophical nature can accompany the moods of this aesthetic.

Works that fall under this category tend to explore the themes of class, industrialism, and feature English staples such as cheap tea and biscuits. Other common themes are the hardships of labour occupations such as coal or steel mining and factory work that are common among those in the working class in England. A lot of Anglo Gothic media is influenced by the boom in council estates being built in the 1960s in England, hence a lot of imagery being evocative of that time. The term 'Anglo Gothic' was coined by Tumblr user demixian in 2020; however, this style for aesthetic is represented back in the '90s. Anglo-gothic envisions run down British suburbs (which mainly have terraced homes that are falling apart or shoddily built apartment buildings). Some other aspects are broken cars from the '90s and early '00s and cloudy or rainy days. Much of this aesthetic can be seen in the early British a Goth and Post-Punk scenes, many of who chose to romanticize their industrialized surroundings and embrace the darkness it entailed. Later, some 90s Britpop went in the same direction (although it wasn’t common). Some music that falls under the Anglo Gothic category includes: Anglo Gothic media is distinct from traditionally Gothic media set in England due to its grounding in more modern times as well as its emphasis on industrial towns and council housing, which became more prominent in the 1960s.

The term is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of ''underground'', which refers to its origins in underground theater. The origin of Angura lies in the underground movement of the same name that first occured during the 60s in Japanese theater. The plays were very experimental with a focus of grotesque and exaggerated depictions of \"normal life\" in Japan during long periods of war, adaption of Ero-Guro novels and manga were also very common. The stage actors would sport shironuri makeup, school uniforms, and traditional kimono elements, which are still common staples of the style nowadays. The clothes tend to be heavily influenced by traditional Japanese elements as well as the Showa era (1926-1989) but with a Goth spin to it. The make-up usually consists of shironuri, and is dark and heavy. While kimono are the most common used by Visual Kei artist, the style also often features modified Japanese school uniforms, such as seifuku and gakuran.

Visually, it could be described as elegant, ethereal and slightly mysterious. Artworks relating to this aesthetic typically involve the night and other elements relating to it, like the moon, stars, moonlight, galaxies, etc., as well as mythological creatures relating to angels or vampires. It is a sister aesthetic of Technoneko2000, as both have influenced Nightcore as a whole. The visuals found in the Anime New Moon aesthetic are all about nighttime and ethereal elements. The color palette of the aesthetic often uses multiple shades of blue (from pastel to navy), white, purple and pink. For instance, PicsArt, a popular image editing app, has an image filter called \"Nightcore\"[1], which also uses this specific color palette associated with the Anime New Moon aesthetic. The aesthetic focuses on beautiful aspects of the night, like the moon, moonlight and stars, as well as other elements like galaxies or waterfalls. The characters featured in the images and edits are typically fantastic characters, like angels, vampires or magical girls. Other elements found in the aesthetic are white birds and butterflies.

It primarily features figurines, posters, and old desks/computers that reflect the Weeaboo anime subculture of the early 2000s to mid 2010s when it was a niche community that was not accepted in mainstream society. It originated in the 2010s with Weeaboo communities such as 4chan who idealized 2000s anime. It also spread to TikTok in the 2020s when anime culture became mainstream with new members idealizing an anime community that they never got to experience. Animecore also heavily overlaps with Cutecore. Both feature similar visuals of edited image collages and pictures of rooms, and both can include darker themes. The primary difference is Cutecore's focus on Kawaii plushies and clothing, while Animecore focuses on 2000s anime figurines. Animecore is not anime on its own, but rather the images consumed outside the context of the stories anime is conveying. The aesthetic culture here is the Western fans of the Japanese genre, rather than the artistic environment within anime, which can encompass multiple aesthetics. Animecore encompasses the period of Otaku and Weeaboo history approximately the early 2000s to mid 2010s, when anime in the United States was only a small online fandom. Due to Animecore's focused time period and the rise in reaction to \"cringe culture\" that is increasingly prevalent on the internet, it overlaps with aesthetics such as Webcore or Scene.  Japanese Anime as a style gained worldwide prominence into the 1990s due in part to a mix of the decade's interest in alternative and creatively freer media in response against highly regulated mainstream media, anime's close relation with entertainment and multimedia technology, especially after the 1980s Japan Bubble Economy which cemented Japan's then electronics monopoly over the world, and its propensity for inciting otherworldly wonder due to its own visuals and expression. This makes its cultural relevance to the era, ever so significant. Animecore represents itself by its high flying visuals and themes it communicates inspiration and insight with, to its bright and colorful to its dark and nightmarish. The overall theme to Animecore can be summed up as \"The Drive of Mankind\"- Be it for a better future, to explore the stars, smash down ancient conspiracies, defying the system, or to even salvage the dark future or merely live life free from troubles and annoyances, it all comes back down to the heart and soul of the people and how far they are willing to go for it. Commonly featured in this aesthetic are edits and GIFs of scenes from popular anime franchises or anime-style music videos, photography of merch collections and rooms, various memes that exist within the anime fandom (like Caramelldansen or Touhou), gaudy Blingee-esque edits, but also stolen and edited fanart that is often posted without neither credit nor permission, which is also common in other aesthetics. Ball-jointed dolls and anime figures are also popular. Sometimes, distortion methods are used to lower image quality to replicate the look of many old web artifacts. Even then, this doesn't touch the surface of Animecore, as fans range far and wide in their interests and series, as web and graphic design range from the simple to more intricate and complex that utilizes detailed art graphic borders and backdrops and overall site design to capture a specific feel for their presentation, and the series themselves presented provide an extension of their own style with additional impressions. Currently into the mid-2010s and 2020s, the primary visual of Animecore is Moe characters, who evoke feelings of affection within viewers. They are always young girls with large eyes, colorful and distinctive hairstyles, and kawaii outfits such as school and maid uniforms, and are often Neko Girls. Images of bedrooms cluttered with anime merchandise, such as posters, figurines, and banners show the simultaneously obsessive and cozy feelings that Animecore conveys. Animecore is commonly part of Linux Ricing, the modification of Linux to be more efficient or aesthetically pleasing. Common themes include: vintage anime aesthetics (such as Serial Experiments Lain and vaporwave), and nostalgia for the bygone early internet and UNIX era. Ahoka Clone is the aesthetic associated with Animecore in the online Linux, programming, and hardware community etc. The name comes from the 4chan boards /g/ and /w/ where a user named Ahoka created the aesthetic. The style is based around having a minimalist wallpaper with a solid color and a single image of an anime girl. Early Animecore defines anime fan aesthetic from before Web 2.0 or the 2010s and even the mid to late 2000s, when HTML 2.0 coding was yet to be implemented. Early Animecore makes use of 1990s and early 2000s anime, manga, and video game series, use of Photoshop edited images, examples including incorporating more \"dreamy\" elements like fade transitions, light bloom borders, border graphics, special effects, and simple to intricate HTML 1.0 coding based layouts. Trashy Animecore is a subgenre of Animecore centered around poorly drawn anime art, often on purpose, for a comical tone. Trashy Animecore can be noted on old anime memes from Nico Nico Douga (such as Gal-O Sengen) and old Fanimes (anime fanseries) from YouTube and Nico Nico Douga (such as Nyan~ Neko Sugar Girls or Koishi Komeiji's Heart Throbbing Adventure). Other characteristics of Trashy Animecore include bad voice acting and poor audio quality. It could be considered a parody of Animecore, and is occasionally used to represent the more cringe elements of Animecore. It shares many similiarities with So Retro, an aesthetic that tries to replicate retro but fails at doing so. More information: Nightcore\nNightcore is a type of music edit referring to increasing the tempo of the song by about 35%, primarily of eurodance songs. It is heavily associated with Animecore, and almost every nightcore edit video features a 2000s anime image.

Orientalism refers to the romanticized portrayal of the East (particularly the Middle East) by the West.

This article describes the idealized and slightly exaggerated traits of arcades in contrast with the real-world location. The photos here are more neon and vibrant than many real-life arcades, and would include images from other aesthetics, such as Synthwave, Nostalgiacore and Glowwave. Arcadecore visuals draw heavy influence from arcades of the 70s, 80's, 90's, and 2000s, which can include neon colors, arcade cabinets, ticket booths, arcade tokens, and other similar elements. Typically, a unique theme is incorporated into the design, most often from the Sci-Fi genre. Arcadecore can also draw heavily from the arcade pizzerias that were popular in the past such as Showbiz Pizza, Chuck E. Cheese, and businesses of that nature, as seen with the Five Nights At Freddy's franchise for example. Arcadecore can also involve laser tag-centric aesthetics. Although mechanical operated arcade games existed since the 1900s, the modern arcade aesthetic originated in the 1970s with the invention of electronic pinball machines and video game cabinets. Arcades in the 70s tended to be decorated with bright colors with neon signs placed on the walls. The decorating trends of the 80s were darker overall but incorporated more colorful elements. Combined with the different lights of the arcade games, an arcade tends to be incredibly multicolored and fluorescent. However, the lighting, walls, and carpets are often in a darker color, such as navy or black, in order to not drown out the lights of the games. Arcadecore fashion can be very low-key or very bright and flashy, but can draw inspiration from Mallgoth, Nostalgiacore, Glowwave, and Vaporwave. Music popular in the Arcadecore aesthetic community include Rock, Synthwave, Vaporwave, Eurodance/Europop, Chiptune, Future Bass, and EDM music.",

It flourished in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, before gradually vanishing in the late 1930s and WW2. Because of this, the style is highly associated with the 'roaring twenties', and provided an escapade from the realities of the Great Depression during the 1930s. There have been multiple revivals, some in the 1980s and multiple today. Art Deco's influence permeated everything from architecture, to film to jewelry. The style uses geometric forms, clean lines, and is often angular or streamlined. Colors are usually bold and chosen for contrast. Patterns are bold and geometric, symmetrical or asymmetrical. Expensive materials were used, both natural (exotic woods, ivory, mother-of-pearl) and manmade (chrome, stainless steel, Bakelite). The Art Deco aesthetic is also very important to Dieselpunk and Decopunk, as without it, neither would really exist. The style was in a constant and very gradual transition, from the highly ornate form of the late 1910s and early 1920s, to the more streamlined and modernistic form of the 1930s. In architecture, the late form of Art Deco from the 1930s in known as Streamline Moderne, or Art Moderne, which had a more pared-down aesthetic, incorporating curves, clean lines and minimal decoration, which developed out of the glamour and style of cruise liners and the polished efficiency of machines. Art Deco initially appeared in France during the 1910s, and spread quickly throughout the world, most dramatically in the United States. Art Deco as an aesthetic was a direct reaction to the previous standard: Art Nouveau (which was popular between 1895 and 1900), and eventually overtook the Beaux-Arts and neoclassical stylings that were popular in European and American architecture at the time. Art Deco actually took inspiration from various other previous aesthetics of the time: pre-modern art that could be seen in the Louvre at the time (among other art museums, Russian Constructivism, Italian Futurism, Orphism, Functionalism, Fauvism, Modernism, the recent unearthing of ancient Egyptian artifacts, and so much more). Art Deco itself eventually evolved into the style known as Streamline Moderne. Shockingly, many examples of Art Deco are still standing to this very day, especially in New York City; buildings such as the Chrysler Building, the American Radiator Building, the General Electric Building, the Comcast Building, and the Empire State Building. Other examples of Art Deco architecture include the Lincoln Theater in Miami, Florida, the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, and the Robert Stanton Theater at King City High School in King City, California.  One of the more popular elements in Art Deco architecture is Streamline Moderne, an international style of Art Deco architecture and design that emerged in the 1930s. It was inspired by aerodynamic design. Streamline architecture emphasized curving forms, long horizontal lines, and sometimes nautical elements.[2] Streamline Moderne appeared most often in buildings related to transportation and movement, such as bus and train stations, airport terminals, roadside cafes, and port buildings. It had characteristics common with modern architecture, including a horizontal orientation, rounded corners, the use of glass brick walls or porthole windows, flat roofs, chrome-plated hardware, and horizontal grooves or lines in the walls. They were frequently white or in subdued pastel colors.[3] Although Streamline Moderne houses are less common than streamline commercial buildings, residences do exist. The Lydecker House in Los Angeles, built by Howard Lydecker, is an example of Streamline Moderne design in residential architecture. In tract development, elements of the style were sometimes used as a variation in postwar row housing in San Francisco's Sunset District. Streamline style can be contrasted with functionalism, which was a leading design style in Europe at the same time. One reason for the simple designs in functionalism was to lower the production costs of the items, making them affordable to the large European working class. Streamlining and functionalism represent two different schools in modernistic industrial design. While Art Deco is primarily renowned as an architectual style, there was a definite painting style associated with the Art Deco aesthetic. The style's simplified forms and strong colours were particularly suited to the graphic arts. The most noteworthy artists associated with it were Adolphe Jean-Marie Mouron (commonly known as Cassandre), Jean Dupas, Tamara de Lempicka, Reginald Marsh, Rockwell Kent, and Diego Rivera. However, the aesthetic tended to lend itself much better to sculpture, as many statues were created in the Art Deco style. Demêtre Chiparus was a Romanian sculptor who worked in Paris, and used ivory brought by Belgian merchants from Congo to make the hands and faces of his figures. Many of his artworks are polychrome (in multiple colours), standing on marble pedestals. The Art Deco period was also one when graphic design and poster illustration flourished. The posters of Adolphe Jean-Marie Mouron (commonly known as Cassandre) are very iconic. They are characterized by flat shapes, simplified icons, limited colours, and gradients. He payed careful attention to alignment and rhythm, using modular grids and combining basic shapes. His posters that present vehicles, like cruise liners or trains, are very expressive, having a highly monolithic look. Exotic woods and luxury materials like mahogany, ebony, shagreen (a type of sharkskin), ivory and mother-of-pearl were used in Art Deco furniture. Many of the famous designers of this style prized high-quality materials, creating pieces and entire interiors that were the epitome of luxury. One of the leading designers was furniture maker Jacques-Émile Ruhlmann. Its reliance on private patrons, most notably from the French couturiers, Paul Poiret and Jacques Doucet, and its incompatibility with industrialized production ensured that Art Deco was a relatively short-lived style. From the beginning, the movement spanned work of designers like René Lalique, Jean Dunand, and Edgar-William Brandt, but also the creations of modernists like Eileen Gray, Pierre Chareau and Robert Mallet-Stevens. The period between the two World Wars was also a time of technological innovation, thanks to advances in plastics, stainless steel, and aluminum. Items like radios, clocks, combs, and even door handles were made of Bakelite an early plastic that could be moulded easily and inexpensively. Affordable objects like these brought Art Deco to many homes. Much of the furniture was luxurious, had sinuous shapes and was produced using rich materials. Some of the most iconic pieces were produced by Jacques-Émile Ruhlmann, a leading French post-WW1 cabinet maker. His creations are considered to be among the finest examples of Art Deco. They were very glossy, often with a ebony and ivory colour contrast. In comparison with the Art Deco furniture that looked luxurious and fluid, some pieces were sturdy and pared-back, with angular, Modernist shapes. Much of this geometric kind of Art Deco furniture was for the US market and was mass-produced. Another area were impressive design were produced during the 1920s and 1930s was the one of clocks. Multiple sets made to be put on mantels were produced. They are often made up of marble and/or onyx with warm colours, and usually have a bronze figurine at the top of the clock. Multiple designers, like Jean Goulden, produced Cubist-inspired pieces, that featured angular geometric shapes. Another influence of Cubism was how some clocks have square, octagonal or even triangular dials. The fonts used for the dial numbers were also Art Deco, so the entire clock looked very harmonious and homogenous. Glass from the same period was extremely creative, expressive, and technically creative. Beautiful effects were achieved by working with layers of glass. Here, fluid motifs taken from Art Nouveau were present, together with new, bold and modern shapes. René Lalique and the Daum bothers (aka Frères Daum) produced some of the most luxurious glass pieces. During the 1930s, Art Deco became more popular, due to its associations with the dreamlike Hollywood lifestyle and, as a result, was eventually fully embraced by mainstream manufacturers. Because of this, kitschy mass produced Art Deco-like objects started to appear. Their quality was in contrast with the one of luxurious designs from the 1920s. Art Deco fashion followed a lot of the same rules laid out for its art and architecture, introducing lots of geometric shapes, long lines, and exaggerated accessories. Art Deco fashion included lots of evening gowns, skirts, hats, and bias-cut dresses. For women, the Art Deco period was the time of the \"flapper\"; a woman who bobbed their hair, loved jazz music, wore excessive make-up, drank, smoked, drove, had casual sex, and generally took a proverbial piss on social norms at the time. The Flapper sub-aesthetic in Art Deco was forever immortalized by the legendary cartoon character, Betty Boop. Jazz is the music genre most associated with the 1920s and the 1930s. However, songs of Maurice Chevalier, like Paris sera toujours Paris and Valentine, or Josephine Baker's Dis moi Josephine and La Petite Tonkinoise, encapsulate the vibe of Art Deco Paris. The creations of Busby Berkeley also capture this vibe. Cuphead is a 2017 video game that is heavily inspired by the cartoons of the 1930s, and so its soundtrack is reminiscent with that period. The style appeared in the 1910s, before WW1. At the beginning, it was not well defined, and so it was influenced by the movements popular at the time, mainly Neoclassicism, Neo-Rococo and the Neo-Louis XVI style. The Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris has a small collection of furniture of this type. The discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamen, opened in November 1922, sparked a wave of Egyptomania. Because of this, there are some examples of 1920s and 1930s Art Deco mixed with Neo-Egyptian motifs. The aesthetic of Ancient Egypt mixed well with Art Deco due to the fact that both use simplified motifs, geometric shapes, symmetry and repetition. The combinations of intense colours found in Ancient Egyptian jewellery were reused in the 1920s. As time passed, Art Deco became increasingly more simplified. The one from the 1930s was different compared to the one from the 1910s and 1920s through its simplicity, and more or less lack of ornamentation. Streamlining involves the contouring of objects into rounded, smoothly finished and often teardrop-shaped aerodynamic shapes so as to reduce their drag and resistance to motion through air. Streamlining was first used in the early 20th century to improve the performance of aircrafts, locomotives and automobiles when moving with high speeds. However, by the 1930s, industrial designers were using streamlining less for functional reasons, and more for making household objects look sleeker and more appealing to the consumer. Using clay models, designers created sleek, modern-looking shapes for a whole range of products, including fridges, vacuum cleaners, radios, cameras and phones. Besides design, streamline forms are also present in the architecture of the 1930s. This made buildings look like huge appliances. A key feature of them are the rounded corners, whether the balconies have them, or the facade is rounded due to the building being at the intersection of two streets. Many buildings in Miami Beach were designed in this style, which continued until the New York World's Fair in 1939. The Art Deco period ended more or less when WW2 started. However, its decline was not linked with the war. There was a very smooth and gradual transition from the ornamented Art Deco designs from the late 1910s and the 1920s, to the minimalist Bauhaus designs of the late 1930s and 1940s. Late Art Deco designs are often simplistic, featuring round corners, giving hints of the trends of the following decades. This is because Modernists wanted to get rid of ornamentation and produce objects and buildings made up of basic shapes, that looked futuristic and machine made. However, interesting and creative shapes can be found in post-Art Deco design and architecture, particularly in Mid-Century Modern and Brutalism.",

The aesthetic was created by Tumblr user sensitiveblackperson.[1] Famous original Art Hoes include actress Amandla Stenberg, stylist Rian Phin, illustrator and musician Jenelle Lewis, and rapper Babeo Baggins. Although it began as a women's African American art movement, it later branched out to include all genders and nationalities who appreciate both art and nature. Typical Art Hoe fashion items include the following: Some typical hairstyles include: Art Hoes are drawn to a vintage aesthetic, often shopping at thrift stores, Urban Outfitters, and even some lesser-known fashion brands. DIY culture is popular among Art Hoes as well, and you will find people with this aesthetic painting or embroidering their designs on their clothing. As implied by the name, the Art Hoe aesthetic involves various forms of visual art and nature. This includes Polaroid pictures, plants (mainly ivy and succulents), acrylic paints, and Copic markers. The aesthetic usually also features pictures of girls in nature as well, specifically girls known to like nature. The music of the Art Hoe subculture draws inspiration from a multitude of influences, encompassing a diverse range of genres. However, four primary genres stand out as the most popular within the art hoe community: Alternative Pop, Indie Pop, Alternative Hip-Hop, and Bedroom Pop. The Art Hoe community is characterized by its strong support for non-mainstream artists, allowing unconventional and alternative music styles to thrive. These artists, often using innovative approaches to music, resonate deeply with Art Hoes. One notable aspect of the Art Hoe music scene is the formation of \"cult\" fanbases around these non-mainstream artists. These passionate communities actively promote and celebrate their favorite musicians and their works. Art Mom describes a person, typically a woman, who is very wholesome and loves art as their own child. There is some overlap with Softie personas in this aesthetic, as Art Moms may be very soft hearted and loving towards their art and others. Artsy Space Kid is an aesthetic that is very similar to Art Hoe but revolving around space instead of nature or art. Artsy Space Kid fashion draws inspiration from Art Hoe: Typical hairstyles include: 2. https://powgoddess.com/blogs/blogs/art-hoe-aesthetic",

It was popular mainly between 1890 and 1910, its period ending with the outbreak of WW1. After the war, it was succeeded by Art Deco and other forms of Modernism. Art Nouveau was a reaction to the academic historicism and eclecticism of the 19th century that favoured fine arts (paintings and sculptures) over applied arts (architecture, furniture, ceramics, etc., much of what we refer to today as \"design\"). It was inspired by natural forms, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers, and whiplash forms. Other defining characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement, often given by asymmetry and by sinuous lines;, the use of modern materials, such as iron pillars with glass, and the young European women depicted as femme fatales. Art Nouveau was known under multiple names based on country or region: Jugendstil in Germany, Nieuwe Kunst in the Netherlands, Modern Style in Great Britain and Modernisme in Catalonia and Spain. Despite being highly associated with the Belle Époque, the movement didn't have a hegemony in Western art of the period. While innovative Art Nouveau buildings were erected around the year 1900, historicist (Neoclassical, Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, etc.) objects and structures were produced during the same period. Sometimes, this led to blends of historic styles and Art Nouveau. After WW1, the movement was seen as very \"passé\", \"dated\" or \"out of fashion\", being replaced by Art Deco and Modernism, which featured angular shapes, a machine-inspired aesthetic, and sometimes completely rejected ornamentation. The avant-garde's preference for simple geometric shapes was better suited to industrial production. Later, Art Nouveau inspired the psychedelic art of the 1960s. Many psychedelic concert posters from the 1960s were in fact copies of Art Nouveau posters, with only their colours and text being changed. Today, many people love Art Nouveau, and some Contemporary artists take their inspiration from this style. Nowadays, the style is best known through Alphonse Mucha's posters that feature young women and foliage designs. The taste of Europeans for Japanese art was one of the key factors that led to the emergence of the movement. Multiple Western artists who worked in this style had collections of Japanese art in their homes, serving as early iterations of weebs. Art Nouveau posters were particularly influenced by Japanese woodblock prints, featuring blank colours and faded earthy colours, like olive green, and visible outlines. Ceramics and glassware were influenced by Japanese pottery, usually being simplistic and in darker earthy colours. Another Japanese influence were the circle-shaped windows present in Art Nouveau architecture; these were frequently based on moon gates found in zen gardens. Due to the fact that Art Nouveau appeared in the late 1880s and 1890s, the movement was somewhat influenced by styles of the 19th century. Usually, these influences range from very subtle to non-existent. In rare cases, some Art Nouveau objects like furniture, ceramics, or metalworks may have some Gothic Revival or Rococo Revival elements, especially in France. In Spain, Antoni Gaudí, the most famous Art Nouveau architect and designer, frequently took inspiration from traditional Catalan styles and Mudéjar and Gothic architecture, and was a prominent figure of the Modernisme movement in Catalonia. In the UK, artists were influenced by the complex knots found in Celtic and Anglo-Saxon artifacts. In Romania, Art Nouveau was a factor that led to the emergence and popularity of the Romanian Revival, or Brâncovenesc Revival style, using elements taken from peasant and Brâncovenesc architecture. Similarly, the National Romantic style appeared in Northern Europe (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia), and some Hungarian examples of Art Nouveau have folkloric sources of inspiration. Despite historic inspirations in some cases, Art Nouveau was a form of anti-historicism. This is because the 19th century was one of revivals, with Greco-Roman revivals (aka Neoclassicism and the Greek Revival style), the Gothic Revival, the Rococo Revival, the Renaissance Revival, the Egyptian Revival, etc. At the end of the century, some artists felt the need to free themselves and their art from this historicist tradition, creating new styles adapted to the spirit of their time. This is particularly the case of the artists and architects of the Vienna Secession, who reacted specifically against the conservative historicism of the Künstlerhaus. Art Nouveau wasn't a consistent style, having different local versions in multiple countries. What most people picture when they think of Art Nouveau is the French and Belgian version, with whiplash lines and foliage ornamentation. The British version had its roots in the Arts and Crafts movement. Because of this, in the UK, the Glasgow School produced objects and structures using straight geometric lines and gentle floral decoration. In Austro-Hungary, artists of The Vienna Secession reacted against the mid- and late-19th century academic eclectic style. Like in the UK, they frequently used straight lines and geometric designs. Examples of this are the Secession Hall in Vienna, Austria (1897-1898, by Joseph Maria Olbrich), the Stoclet Palace in Brussels, Belgium (1905-1911, by Josef Hoffmann), and Gustav Klimt's pantings from his golden period, like The Kiss (1907-1908). Due to these facts, some of the fonts used in British and Austrian Art Nouveau posters are reminiscent of Art Deco and Bauhaus typefaces. Local versions of the movement were also determined by the fact that artists sometimes took inspiration from styles specific to their country. In Sweden and Norway, some of the Art Nouveau buildings and objects were inspired by those of Vikings, usually with complex knot-shaped ornaments (aka interlaces). In Romania, the style was not allowed by the authorities, due to the fact that it was popular in Transylvania, a region of the Austro-Hungarian empire at that time where Romanians were oppressed. So, the Romanians who wanted an Art Nouveau home in the 1900s and early 1910s could only put some subtile ornaments reminiscent of the style, while the rest was completely in the academic Beaux Arts style. Key Art Nouveau visual elements and features: The most recognisable and iconic characteristic of Art Nouveau is the use of motifs based on plants and organic shapes like flowers, vines and leaves, most often represented in ironwork. In many ways, the use of organic shapes was a conscious reaction to the Beaux-Arts academic style. The whiplash, or whiplash line, is a motif of decorative art and design that was particularly popular in Art Nouveau. It is an asymmetrical, sinuous line, often in an ornamental S curve, usually inspired by natural forms, which suggests dynamism and movement. Architects liked to use the mix of glass and metal in Art Nouveau architecture, which was seen as a sign of modernity at that time. The Paris metro entrances, designed by Hector Guimard around the year 1900, are a very good example of this. Thus, in contrast with the past, Art Nouveau architects didn't try to hide the metal structure of a building, instead making metalwork an integral, intentional, and beautiful part of a building.

In bodybuilding (especially in recent years), there are two different competing philosophies as it pertains to where bodybuilding should go.  The first is what's often referred to as \"classic\" or \"golden era\", which is a throwback to the golden era of bodybuilding (which contains individuals like Sergio Oliva and Arnold Schwarzeneggar) where, while size is important, it's not as important as having a very visually pleasing figure which can be attained by a variety of factors; the right genetics, the proper diet, the proper exercise routine, and, yes, drugs (though there are some who are referred to as \"all-natural\", meaning they forgo any drug usage and instead maintain a strict diet and exercise routine without having to rely on steroids or human growth hormones.  This philosophy has gotten so popular in recent years that the IFBB (the biggest governing body in bodybuilding) have set up a specific division for this bodybuilding philosophy called \"Classic Physique\".  Adherents to this philosophy include individuals like Breon Ansley and Chris Bumstead. The second philosophy is often referred to as \"the mass monster\", where it's about trying to get to be as freakishly big as possible, regardless if your figure is aesthetically pleasing or not (though there are some in this particular philosophy who do have at least mildly aesthetically pleasing bodies) who compete in what's known as \"Men's Open\".  Popular examples of bodybuilders who follow this philosophy include Dorian Yates, Phil Heath, Ronnie Coleman, Jay Cutler, Kai Greene, and Mamdouh \"Big Ramy\" Elssbiay. On top of these primary two philosophy, there are other forms of bodybuilding, including Men's Physique (usually the smaller of the bunch and not nearly as intensive as Classic Physique and Men's Open, though you still have to put in the work to maintain an aesthetically pleasing figure), 212 (which is the next step up from Men's Physique where you have to maintain a weight of at least 212 pounds to be eligible), as well as women's bodybuilding (which contains individuals such as Rachel McLish etc), which can be split up into Bikini, Figure, Fitness, and finally Women's Bodybuilding.",

Modern depictions tend to use a distinct, brightly-colored art style but it can also appear just as it does in the page's main image. It often depicts imagery associated with \"traditionally American\" values, particularly a belief in the nuclear family and the suburban lifestyle. But it's important to note that this isn't the Googie or Raygun Gothic aesthetic; it does not center itself around a utopian future but rather a dystopian nightmare. Atompunk is the dark underbelly of 1950s and 1960s sci-fi characterized by potential dark futures such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, satirical parodies of typically suburban American life such as Dad's Nuke and more recently satirical parodies of the Raygun Gothic and Googie aesthetic such as Futurama. Atompunk typically envisions a satirical or dark twist on the Raygun Gothic/Googie/Populuxe aesthetic such as post-apocalyptic space age settings like Dad's Nuke and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep though Atompunk will sometimes take the form of the simple Googie aesthetic, just with punk sensibilities. Atompunk fashion tends to draw heavy inspiration from how people in the 1950s/1960s viewed how the future was going to look, similarly to Raygun Gothic's fashion, so a lot of the outfits seen in pulp sci-fi of the time tend to be the primarily focus on Atompunk fashion, as well as T-shirts adorned with graphics invoking the covers of pulp sci-fi comic books of the time (which did tend to be rather sexually suggestive from time to time) being part of the Atompunk fashion aesthetic. The Atompunk aesthetic originated from the Raygun Gothic and Googie aesthetic being born from the eccentric but brilliant mind of Philip K Dick with the book known as Solar Lottery. It is the dark underbelly of the Raygun Gothic aesthetic and was created as a way to vent frustration at 1950s and 60s American society, acting as the counterculture to the typically utopian or otherwise non-dystopian stories that were popular at the time. The term Atompunk was obviously created after Cyberpunk was invented but it has existed in spirit long before the aesthetic made pessimism popular similar to Dieselpunk works such as Metropolis and Things to Come. Why is this stuff considered atompunk while media such as The Jetsons, Calvin and Hobbes and all the other non-dystopian 60s/50s retrofuturism are considered Raygun Gothic? Simple, the term punk has a meaning. While most would liken the meaning to just being connected to the punk movement, like cyberpunk, that's a misattribution; instead, the term punk refers to how countercultural it was in its context. Steampunk was countercultural in the sense that it was the development of a completely unique and new genre that oftentimes defied societal norms. Dieselpunk consists of two aesthetics: Ottensian Dieselpunk/Decopunk and Piecraftian Dieselpunk ( every other part of the Dieselpunk genre like Brazil, Metropolis, Things To Come, Etc) which were created as counterculture in their respective genres (Ottensian after World War 2, Piecraftian during and before World War 2). Meanwhile, The Jetsons was created specifically as a celebration of its culture and not something designed to push against the culture; but the things Phillip K Dick made were designed as counterculture. The most well-known example of Atompunk in the present day is the Fallout series, which seems to take influence from early-to-mid atompunk media such as 2000 AD and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep",

This genre focuses on the concept of magic being tied to the soul and the artistic interpretation of that feeling. It is dream-like, surreal, magical, otherworldly, and pure. It is the brightest, most colorful light that luminates hope in a dark world. Auroracore seems to be somewhat of a combination of Snowdrop and Unicorncore, but lacks the complete requirements to fall under those aesthetics or encompasses more than what the mentioned aesthetics requirements are. Because Auroracore is a fairly new aesthetic, the media surrounding it is limited and almost nonexistent. It primarily exists through the internet in forms such as art pieces and aesthetic boards. The aesthetic may have originated from themes relating to the Walt Disney Company. Key examples are the Disney World 50th Anniversary and D100 aesthetic styles, as well as the visuals of the Magic Happens parade. The term “Auroracore” was coined by Wiki user LucidDaydreamm in September 2021, named after an original character of LucidDaydreamm’s. Auroracore uses both color theory and artistic expression to convey the concepts of beauty, purity, magic being tied to one's soul or identity, and the expulsion of darkness. One of the key artistic devices of this aesthetic used to convey those values is the unnatural emphasis or exaggeration of fantasy elements. For this reason, the aesthetic must always be unrealistic. Motifs such as stars, crystals, and feathers are commonly used. These elements by themselves are often tied to purity and magic use, which are two very important main themes of this aesthetic. This aesthetic mainly consists of the colors blue and purple, although pinks and cyans can be seen as well. Whites, blacks, grays, and metallics are also often included, but are only shown accompanied by the other colors. Subjects of this aesthetic must always depict multiple of these colors and have a luminous, glowy, or surreal effect to emphasize the element of fantasy or magic. Warmer colors such as reds and oranges do not exist in this aesthetic unless they are accent colors in small quantities. One of the concepts that this aesthetic revolves around is the concept of an \"ethereal form.\" These \"forms\" are brought to life when one discovers the power of an element about themselves that is a part of their soul identity. Examples of the demonstration of this aesthetic in media include: Related characters include: Music related to Auroracore has a mystic and fantasy feel - this means that several genres can be applied to this aesthetic. The most common genres associated with this aesthetic include Classical, Synthpop, and Dance. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

Pushing boundaries with his development of Cubism, Pablo Picasso was part of the early 20th-century art world’s avant-garde. In French, avant-garde means the \"vanguard\" or the \"advance guard\" — basically the people whose ideas and techniques that are ahead of their time or in advance of those generally known or accepted. Usually it refers to a movement in the arts, like Dadaism, or in politics, like anarchism. The term can also be used as an adjective to describe something that’s cutting-edge. Avant-garde design has traditionally made up only a small percentage of manufactured goods, yet its influence on the history of design has been enormous. Generally, works and ideas of this type have had an impact far beyond the audiences made of small circles for whom they were primarily intended. Usually, some years must pass for an avant-garde concept or design to catch up. For example, Marcel Breuer's pioneering tubular metal furniture from the late 1920s and 1930s was not nearly as widely accepted in its own day as it was in the 1960s and 70s. The work of the avant-garde is frequently given the adjective \"New\" - New Art, Art Nouveau, New Wave - to describe its forward-looking agenda. Avant-garde music is music that is considered to be at the forefront of experimentation or innovation in its field, with the term \"avant-garde\" implying a critique of existing aesthetic conventions, rejection of the status quo in favor of unique or original elements, and the idea of deliberately challenging or alienating audiences. Avant-garde in music can refer to any form of music working within traditional structures while seeking to breach boundaries in some manner. The term is used loosely to describe the work of any musicians who radically depart from tradition altogether In fashion terms, avant-garde spanned generations of notable designers who reshaped the way people perceive and wear clothes.",

        "description": "B-Movie Horror\n\n\n\n\nThe Devil Bat, 1940\n\n\nKey Values\nLow budgets, formulaic scripts, relatively short running times, and minimal production design\n\n\nRelated Aesthetics\nHorrorDevilcoreGorecoreGothicHalloweenVampireWerewolfWitchcore The B-Movie Horror aesthetic is a love letter to a mostly bygone era of film. It is taken from the often outlandish looks of cheaply-made 1930s-1980s B-horror movies, which aimed not to stay in the public consciousness as great pieces of art but instead to entertain (and in this case scare) audiences for the duration of their runtimes, and make some money, then be forgotten. Still, many of these old horror films have gained cult followings and enjoy a place in modern culture thanks to memorable characters, plots, effects, and of course the aesthetic. Features of this aesthetic include grainy or washed-out-looking footage, cheap effects (especially prosthetics and fake blood), ridiculous but distinctively styled posters, and dramatic title screens. (This will specifically cover American B-horror movies and B-movie culture. Feel free to add information on B-horror from your country.) During the Great Depression, the film industry was hit hard. To entice people to go to theaters, films began to be screened in pairs, called Double Features. Often one of these films, called the \"A-Movie,\" would have the bigger budget and a longer runtime, while the second, the \"B-Movie,\" would be much more cheaply produced, and were at first made by up-and-coming talent as opposed to more experienced directors, writers, and actors. Later, films bought from failing studios were screened as B-features. In the 1950s and 1960s, B-horror movies became especially popular, somewhat thanks to the Silent Generation and Baby Boomers becoming teenagers and young adults with disposable income. B-horror movies of this era are what many people tend to think of when they think of B-horror, with their bright colors and dramatic narration. This was the early part of the Cold War, when horror movies fed off of Americans' fear of nuclear war, mind control, spies and stolen identity, and alien invasions (which were all of course metaphors for communism and/or teenagers). Some of these B-horror films are lost, and most are simply not remembered, but some are still a part of cultural and sub-cultural canon to this day, including (according to IMDb) The Giant Claw, The Alligator People, Teenagers from Outer Space, and Attack of the 50-Foot Woman. With the rise of in-home televisions in the 1950s onward, double-features became much less profitable, and B-movies began to be used for late-night programming. Early made-for-TV movies could have higher budgets and were more like anthology series or mini-series, but the rise of TV also lent itself to the new sub-genre of exploitation films, a type of low-budget movie with an emphasis on sex and gore. The 1980s and 1990s made up the second great era of B-movies, thanks to the rise of home video. Now, cheaply-made movies could be released directly to video and marketed in video stores instead of going through the much more expensive process of releasing to theaters. These were extremely popular, probably owing to the fact that they were so cheap to make and watch.  Some of the best-remembered B-horror movies came out in this era, defining the genre for Gen-Xers and Millennials. B-horror movies from this era include Killer Klowns from Outer Space (a parody of 1950s B-invasion movies), Demonic Toys, Happy Birthday to Me, Chopping Mall, Ice Cream Man, and of course the charmingly strange Blood Rage. Many a horror series that began in theaters at this time had countless straight-to-VHS or made-for-TV sequels, including Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Jaws, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. A lot of these continued to get sequels, or were totally remade or rebooted, as DVDs became the more dominant form of home video entertainment in the 2000s. In a more cynical post-9/11 world, the horror genre was loaded with what would have once been called B-movies. There was of course the sub-genre of found footage films, popularized by 1999's The Blair Witch Project, and what we now call \"torture porn.\" Violence, gore, torture, insanity, and a largely pessimistic feel characterized this sub-genre, which includes House of 1000 Corpses, the Saw franchise, Hostel, and The Human Centipede. There were some comedic and parodic B-horror movies, too, (Birdemic and Evil Bong, for example), but they were nowhere near as popular as they had been in the 1980s. No discussion of B-horror movies would be complete without at least mentioning the 2010s made-for-TV franchise Sharknado (which is somewhat a parody of the 1950s B-disaster horror movies), that started a whole sub-genre of imitators, and brought killer shark movies back into the pop cultural conversation for a little while. Finally, in the 2010s streaming became the primary way of watching movies. Many old Double-Feature horror films can be found for free on YouTube, and newer films can be watched with subscriptions (and sometimes also for free on YouTube). They're not necessarily coming back, in the sense that they are becoming popular again, because they never really left, but a whole new generation of film nerds now has the opportunity to discover the weird and wonderful world of B-movie horror. In short, B-horror movies are not high art, but they have been around for a long time, and they maintain a place in popular culture.",

This aesthetic leans toward softer, more Kawaii elements, and is distinguished from Kidcore through its usage of lighter colors and visuals typically reserved for babies and toddlers as opposed to school-aged children. It also differs from both Softie and Dollette(which it is often mistaken for) in that it is much frillier and more childish, and from Babygirl in that it lacks suggestive or nsfw undertones. Morute is also similar to Babycore but with dark, creepy, or gothic elements that are not found in Babycore. Babycore is often associated with age regression/littlespace, although not everyone who enjoys this aesthetic uses it to enter a younger headspace. Babycore is inspired by soft Kawaii aesthetics, namely Yume Kawaii, Sweet Lolita/Sweet Boystyle, and Sanriocore/Melodycore, as well as Delicate Sweet,and also often has some Kitschy elements. It is also very similar to the Puppycore subtype of Petcore. It is important to note, since many people get confused, that Babycore is NOT interchangeable with being an ABDL or the adult baby community. Some adult babies may have this aesthetic for their roleplay or regression, but not all of them do and something is not automatically babycore just because it is babyish and used in this context. There is a small but significant divide in the babycore aesthetic community between hyperfeminine, soft, vintage, cherub-like, very light-colored visuals more aligned with Delicate Sweet, and more modern, plastic, cluttered, colorful (but still soft) visuals, more inspired by Yume Kawaii and Jojifuku. These two sections of the community can often overlap and are not different enough to become their own unique aesthetics; they are united as a community by their shared values of childlikeness, innocence, and \"cuteness\", and visually by the use of pastels and infants'/young children's items. Babycore visuals include: Personality traits that can represent childlike behavior are as follows: Since babycore is an aesthetic rather than a specific fashion style, fashion can take inspiration from any soft, babyish, and/or kawaii styles. Fashion inspired by Melanie Martinez Crybaby era is popular. Although some may choose to wear adult baby onesies, babycore does not necessarily focus on infant-like style. It leans more towards \"girly\" toddler fashion, such as: Apart from being leaned towards \"girly-like features\", there are baby boy outfits out there: External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

Babygirl encompasses sweet and innocent imagery and attitudes that give the adult wearer an overall childlike feel. This aesthetic is similar to the soft girl or kawaii style. The Babygirl aesthetic is inspired by Soft Girl, Erokawa, and Babycore, but with the substyles can vary from Bubblegum Bitch or Bimbocore to E-Girl or Pastel Goth. Often this can cross over with bratty attitudes and behavior; this means the sweet and submissive nature can morph into teasing, pouting, tantrums, entitlement, and a compulsion to challenge others. These childish themes allow the person to release typical adult stressors and fall into a more easy and comfortable state of mind as a stress relief technique sometimes known as voluntary age regression or littlespace. Although, this aspect in its depth is not required or utilized by all in the community and is reliant on individual preference. The main purpose of this aesthetic, seperate from the sexual part, is to allow adults to feel and reclaim childhood wonderment and comfort, and to also overcome obstacles from abuse (similar to Traumacore's purpose) and heal while still maintaining a more matured sense of style and dignity. Be advised when searching terms related to this aesthetic as the results will show explicit content aimed at adults 18+. TBA Visuals for babygirls lie on a vast spectrum under the cute, feminine umbrella. This ranges from baby and toddler motifs to traditional adult feminine silhouettes and beauty standards. Many visuals are colored pink or any pastel color, usually traditionally feminine colors. The visuals include, but are not limited to: The main side of the Babygirl aesthetic tends to wear flirtier, pastel clothing, and younger clothing. Can look similar to Dollete and Softie except more babyish and Kawaii, very similar to Babycore, except often with a more erotic undertone that is not found in Babycore. Some staples include: Unlike the main, softer, side of the Babygirl, this aesthetic is less babycore and more bubblegum bitch. This means it's less cutesy and more chic. Baddie Babygirls may be more bratty, but still childlike at heart. This type often has visuals relating to makeup, playgrounds and Barbie or Bratz dolls. Similar to Barbiecore with more Baddie and Bimbocore influence. This the Babygirl style that tends to prefer darker colors than the typical Babygirl would enjoy. Often darker imagery is associated with this side as well, like weaponry, chains, and cute devil-esque figures. They may act like brats like the Baddie side would yet can still be sweet and small. This can encompass everything previously stated about Babygirls, just with darker colors and themes, although pinks and light colors are still used. This is similar in style to E-Girl, Pastel Goth, Gimbo/Goth Bimbocore, and sometimes Kinderwhore or Morute, with visuals stemming from these as well. This can include weapons with sparkles, nighttime, pink-hued photographs, roses, chains, and much more. Criticism of the Babygirl aesthetic primarily centers on concerns about its potential romanticization of pedophilia. This criticism arises from the aesthetic's association with ageplay and power dynamics, where a dominant caretaker assumes a parental role over a submissive partner adopting a childlike persona. Critics argue that this dynamic, despite being consensual among adults, may inadvertently contribute to the sexualization of childlike attributes. The use of terms like \"babygirl\" has been criticized for blurring the lines between a consensual adult dynamic and darker themes associated with incest and child sexual abuse. Some critics fear that the aesthetic may create a dangerous scenario, particularly when it comes to underage individuals participating or being exposed to the sexualized elements associated with the aesthetic. Babygirl is sometimes likened to the controversial Nymphet aesthetic, where concerns about the sexualization of minors also come into play. Despite these criticisms, members of the babygirl community emphasize the importance of consent, safety, and aftercare, distancing themselves from any association with pedophilia. The majority of participants argue that the aesthetic is a form of consensual adult roleplay that centers around trust, vulnerability, and healing, rather than endorsing inappropriate relationships with minors.

It takes the already-present romanticism of ballets themselves and gears it towards the academia culture. It includes imagery from classical and contemporary ballet, as well as modern and post-modern dance (particularly from the techniques of Lester Horton and Martha Graham). It is extremely broad and varied, much as the imagery of classical dance itself is. It can be Gothic and dark (for example, Suspiria and Black Swan), ethereal and light (An American in Paris and The Glass Slipper), the academic and practical (The Turning Point and Dance Academy) or a mix of all of three (The Red Shoes and Princess Tutu). There is also a great deal of fairy tale and mythological references involved, as much of ballet and modern dance pieces often feature supernatural subject matter. Typical symbolism usually involves swans, wings, and black and white contrasts (as much of the stereotypical imagery comes from Swan Lake and La Sylphide.) In literature and film it often features tropes of ballet being a melodramatic, tragic, agonizing, and overly-insulated world. As these stereotypes are taken more from the fantasy of the plots of ballets themselves than from the reality of the dance world (which is a small, but supportive community of artists), these tropes are unnecessary to the aesthetic. It can be appreciated equally by ballet/modern dance aficionados as much as actual dancers (professional or not). Ballet Academia activities are either learning about ballet or activities relating to it, such as: Clothing for this aesthetic is elegant and graceful, and are usually dancing leotards or performance dresses. Many high fashion designers (such as Chanel, Christian Dior, and Rodarte) have created ballet and modern dance costumes, particularly for the Ballet Russes in the 20s. While dance imagery can be found in any genre of music, there are pieces specifically written for ballets reaching as far and wide as Tschaikovsky to Copeland. Few contemporary artists enjoy this imagery, although Stevie Nicks (due to her personal fondness for ballet and it’s influence on her personal style) has often returned to this aesthetic. Her videos for “Gypsy”, “If Anyone Falls”, and “Stand Back” are particularly balletic.",

The aesthetic is strongly associated with Coquette, a hyper-feminine aesthetic among teenaged girls. Balletcore itself may have started from Princesscore and other feminine aesthetics gaining popularity during the pandemic.[1] The aesthetic also gained popularity in South Korea and other nations.[2] The style is based on either the practice outfits or the performance costumes of professional ballet dancers, which includes very specific trends and textiles that developed separately from mainstream fashion. Throughout fashion trends, ballet has always had some influence, but with this trend, the trend was more explicit, with the entire outfit being ballet-inspired, as well as the name being prominent. Balletcore is largely based on pre-existing fashion that has always existed within the ballet-dancing community and in performances. The beginnings of ballet as people know it today began in the Romantic period during the early 19th century in Western Europe. The lasting influence from that period in fashion is the use of long, calf-length sheer skirts and the introduction of pointe shoes, which are specialized shoes that allow dancers to stand and move on the tips of their toes. As the dance continued into the 20th century, the use of sportswear was vital for this activity. Leotards, knit jersey, and other modern inventions became commonplace within the studio. As many fashion designers took inspiration from the performances, as well as other people looking to dancers as a symbol of grace, people mimicked their fashion in everyday clothing. For a more comprehensive history on ballet's influence on fashion, see the Wikipedia article. The rest of the section will now focus on Balletcore as a modern trend related to the internet and virality. Like in the past, designer fashion brands included ballet elements in recent collections. Simone Rocha is a designer known for contributing to the aesthetic due to her consistent use of tulle, pearls, and satin. Specific designer garments also led to the rise of the aesthetic. Miu Miu's ballet flats, with the same satin material and bows as a pointe shoe, debuted in the F/W 2022 collection.[3] (Note that F/W collections are always shown in summer.) Part of this trend is also the return of early to mid 2000s fashion; ballet flats, legwarmers, bolero cardigans, and ruffled skirts were incredibly popular among teenagers during this time, and a more preppy and feminine aesthetic was generally popular. Balletcore also became known in South Korea because of the incredibly famous K-pop group Red Velvet basing their March 2022 EP Feel My Rhythm's aesthetic on ballet. In their music video and promotional pictures, they wear pink satin high heels and corsets with white chiffon dresses. Many popular co-existing aesthetics contributes to the popularity of Balletcore among internet teens. The Coquette community, which has a pink, frilly aesthetic that includes ribbons and tulle, often crosses over. Another link with the Balletcore community and its popularity is the emergence of the online \"female rage\" fandom/community, which is incredibly linked with Waif. The online community focuses on discussing media with mentally ill female characters; this includes the film Black Swan as a major inspiration, and its distinctive costume design was aspirational to many young women. Balletcore is largely a fashion aesthetic. However, the framing of many photos is often tied to the setting of a ballet studio, which is very specific with its mirrored wall, rubber or hardwood floors, and barres (horizontal poles for practicing dance.) Often, the models/influencers would also pose as if they were dancing ballet, such as turning out their feet, looking off to the side, or mimicking the hand position of dancers. Ballet has had a large influence on textiles, as clothes for active movement or the expectations in design for ballet performances require them. Mainstream fashion takes influence from ballet with flowy dresses or tutus, light and breezy layers, leg warmers, and ballet shoes. On the performance side, satin, lace, and tulle are common, while on the practice side, soft knitwear, spandex, lycra, and chiffon are worn. The popularity of Balletcore can be related to the rising concern that the skinny body trend is coming back. Ballet as a profession has long been associated with anorexia and other eating disorders. Because the aspirational image and motifs of the fashion are associated with people who are thin, there is concern that teenaged girls would gain eating disorders in pursuit of the aesthetic. Many pro-Ana and thinspo blogs have already posted or reposted content relating to Balletcore. Many ballet dancers also dislike the aesthetic because it is essentially cosplaying ballet dancers who wear this in their day-to-day profession, often with little accuracy. There does not appear to be political or social criticism. But rather, some consider it cringe, but do appreciate that it makes the public excited about the dance.[4] External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

Barbiecore is the more kid-friendly version of its more adult, jaded, McBling inspired sisters Bubblegum Bitch and Bimbocore. The main defining characteristic of this aesthetic, which can vary in fashion style, is the color hot pink. The aesthetic also includes more \"girly\" 2000s television series like Lizzie McGuire and Hannah Montana, which focused on middle class American families. These shows encouraged confidence, female friendships, freedom, and girl power. Other products produced for tweens and teens in the early 2000s, like Lip Smackers, are also part of the aesthetic. Imagery from a more upper-class lifestyle created by the Barbie toy line and movies, which includes multiple cars, a private jet, huge house, multiple pets including horses, and a yacht, is also found in this aesthetic, especially when the items are pink. Fashion takes inspiration from the Soft Girl and Pretty Preppy fashion, though with fashion inspired by specific Barbie movies there can be crossover with Key West Kitten, Fairycore, Princesscore/Pink Princess, Mermaidcore, and Equestrian aesthetics. The cutesy graphics can cause a crossover with Sanriocore or Unicorncore. Barbiecore accessories include: Barbie is most often depicted as a white woman with blonde hair and blue eyes.

The term \"Baroque\" originated from the Portuguese word barroco, which means \"misshapen pearl.\" Barroco was used first to criticize the overly ornate music of the Baroque era. It was later also applied to art, fashion, and architecture of the period, but eventually lost its pejorative tone. Though relatively minor, the 20th and 21st centuries have seen a renewed and prolonged interest in Baroque music, art, and motifs. Famously, Dolce and Gabbana's 2012 collection of Baroque-inspired clothing confirmed a subtle, decades-long trend: a comeback for some of the Baroque era's most recognizable patterns and colors. The Baroque artistic movement is characterized by its melodramatic tableaus, lavish ornamentation, use of deep colors, chiaroscuro, and asymmetry. The paintings most commonly depict scenes from the Bible or Greek mythology and portraits of nobility. Common visuals include: The Baroque emerged from the Counter Reformation as an attempt by the Catholic Church in Rome to convey its power and to emphasize the magnificence of God. The Baroque and its late variant the Rococo were the first truly global styles in the arts. Dominating more than two centuries of art and architecture in Europe, Latin America and beyond from circa 1580 to circa 1800. Born in the painting studios of Bologna and Rome in the 1580s and 1590s, and in Roman sculptural and architectural ateliers in the second and third decades of the 17th century, the Baroque spread swiftly throughout Italy, Spain and Portugal, Flanders, France, the Netherlands, England, Scandinavia, and Russia, as well as to central and eastern European centres from Munich (Germany) to Vilnius (Lithuania). The Portuguese, Spanish and French empires and the Dutch treading network had a leading role in spreading the two styles into the Americas and colonial Africa and Asia, to places such as Lima, Mozambique, Goa and the Philippines. Due to its spread in regions with different architectural traditions, multiple kinds of Baroque appeared based on location, different in some aspects, but similar overall. For example, French Baroque appeared severe and detached by comparison, preempting Neoclassicism and the architecture of the Age of Enlightenment. Hybrid Native American/European Baroque architecture first appeared in South America (as opposed to Mexico) in the late 17th century, after the indigenous symbols and styles that characterize this unusual variant of Baroque had been kept alive over the preceding century in other media, a very good example of this being the Jesuir Church in Arequipa (Peru). The first Baroque buildings were cathedrals, churches and monasteries, soon joined by civic buildings, mansions, and palaces. Being characterized by dynamism, for the first time walls, façades and interiors curved, a good example being San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in Rome. Baroque architects took the basic elements of Renaissance architecture, including domes and colonnades, and made them higher, grander, more decorated, and more dramatic. The interior effects were often achieved with the use of quadratura, or trompe-l'œil painting combined with sculpture: the eye is drawn upward, giving the illusion that one is looking into the heavens. Clusters of sculpted angels and painted figures crowd the ceiling. Light was also used for dramatic effect; it streamed down from cupolas and was reflected from an abundance of gilding. Solomonic columns were often used, to give an illusion of upwards motion and other decorative elements occupied every available space. In Baroque palaces, grand stairways became a central element. Besides architecture, Baroque painting and sculpture are characterized by dynamism too. This is in contrast with how static and peaceful Renaissance art is. Besides the building itself, the space where it was placed had a role too. Both Baroque and Rococo buildings try to seize viewers' attention and to dominate their surroundings, whether on a small scale such as the San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in Rome, or on a massive one, like the new facade of the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, designed to tower over the city. A manifestation of power and authority on the grandest scale, Baroque urban planning and renewal was promoted by the church and the state alike. It was the first era since antiquity to experience mass migration into cities, and urban planners took idealistic measures to regulate them. The most notable early example was Domenico Fontana's restructuring of Rome's street plan of Pope Sixtus V. Architects had experimented with idealized city schemes since the early Renaissance, examples being Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472) planning a centralized model city, with streets leading to a central piazza, or Filarete (Antonio di Pietro Aver(u)lino, c. 1400-c. 1469) designing a round city named Sforzinda (1451-1456) that he based on parts of the human body in the idea that a healthy city should reflect the physiognomy of its inhabitants. However, none of these idealistic cities has ever been built. In fact, few such projects were put into practice in Europe as new cities were prohibitively costly and existing urban areas, with existing churches and palaces, could not be demolished. Only in the Americas, where architects often had a clean space to work with, were such cities possible, as in Lima (Peru) or Buenos Aires (Argentina). The earliest Baroque ideal city is Zamość, built north-east of Krakow (Poland) by the Italian architect Bernardo Morando (c. 1540-1600), being a centralized town focusing on a square with radiating streets. Where entire cities could not be rebuilt, patrons and architects compensated by creating spacious and symmetrical squares, often with avenues and radiating out at perpendicular angles and focusing on a fountain, statue or obelisk. A good example of this is the Place des Vosges (formerly Place Royale), commissioned by Henry IV probably after plans by Baptiste du Cerceau (1545-1590). The most famous Baroque space in the world is Gianlorenzo Bernini's St. Peter's Square in Rome. Similar with ideal urban planning, Baroque gardens are characterized by straight and readapting avenues, with geometric spaces. Succeeding Mannerism, and developing as a result of religious tensions across Europe, Baroque art emerged in the late 16th century. The name may derive from 'barocco', the Portugueseword for misshaped pearl, and it describes art that combined emotion, dynamism and dramawith powerful color, realism and strong tonal contrasts. Between 1545 and 1563 at the Council of Trent, it was decided that religious art must encourage piety, realism and accuracy, and, by attracting viewers' attention and empathy, glorify the Catholic Church and strengthen the image of Catholicism. In the next century the radical new styles of Baroque art both embraced and developed High Renaissance models, and broke new ground both in religious art and in new varieties of secular art – above all landscape. A key feature of multiple Baroque paintings is the strong contrasts of light and darkness on certain parts of the picture to direct attention to the central actions or figures. This was done for producing a dramatic atmosphere and creating spectacular effects of highlight and shadow. Artists wanted to make the viewer experience awe. They also often used asymmetry, with action occurring away from the centre of the picture, and created axes that were neither vertical nor horizontal, but slanting to the left or right, giving a sense of instability and movement. Applied arts prospered in this style. Baroque furniture could be as bombastic and covered in gold leaf, as the rooms they were meant to adorn, and their motifs and techniques were carefully calibrated to coordinate with the architect's overall decorative programme. One of the most prestigious furniture makers was André Charles Boulle, known for his marquetry technique, made by gluing sheets of tortoiseshell and brass together and cut to form the design. His works were also adorned with gilded bronze mounts. Complex Gobelins tapestries featured scenes inspired by classical antiquity, and the Savonnerie manufactory produced big highly detailed carpets for the Louvre. These carpets with black or yellow backgrounds had a central motif or a medallion. Chinese porcelain, Delftware and mirrors fabricated at Saint-Gobain (France) spread rapidly in all princely palaces and aristocratic residences in France. During the reign of Louis XIV, big mirrors are put above fireplace mantels, and this trend will last long after the Baroque period, being popular even today when someone wants to have a Vintage room decor. Despite being highly decorated, Baroque designs are characterized by rigor, symmetry and overall balance. Symmetrical elemnts flank vertical or horizontal axes. A key motif are human faces (aka mascarons), sometimes surrounded by radiating solar rays or by peacock tail-shaped ornaments called palmettes. Other motifs widely used in Baroque design include cherubs (aka putti), scallop shells, foliage spirals (aka rinceaux), lion heads, ram heads, gryphons,  garlands of various leafs, flowers or fruits (aka festoons), acanthus leafs, urns, balusters (especially at the top of highly detailed cabinets), corbels, trophies of arms, modillions (often featuring inside a man from profile), oval-shaped frames called cartouches, tassels, ribbons, bows and rectagular or diaper (lozenge) lattice patterns decorated with dots or florets. Most of these ornaments will be also used in Rococo, Neoclassical and Victorian designs, but a little modified. When it comes to furniture, large solid wood pieces were made of chestnut, walnut, or oak. They were often gilded, or decorated with veneer or marquetry made of many woods of various and contrasting tones. Gilded bronze fittings were added to the wood structure. Besides ornaments, bronze was also used for handles, lock plates, hinges and for other practical elements. Beds often had baldaquins with curatins, and were decorated with urns at the corners of their top. Tables, particularly consoles, were highly decorated. They had marble, porphyry or alabaster tops, and sometimes marquetry was used to create patterns. When it comes to seating, armchairs, chairs and folding stools were used. Patterns, fabrics and materials: Baroque music is spirited and extravagant, much like its artistic and architectural counterparts. It is characterized by winding, florid melodies, and the bass line often serves as a \"heartbeat\" which drives the music forward. Well known Baroque composers and some examples of their work: For LGBT people of the Baroque era, please see the Wikipedia articles for LGBT people in the 17th and 18th centuries. In recent decades, some LGBT people have adopted the Baroque aesthetic as part of their stage or performing act. The trailblazing singer Klaus Nomi used Baroque music, motifs, and costumes in his performances in the 1970s and especially the 1980s. Presently, the singer Prince Poppycock dons stylized Baroque costumes for performances. The popular dancer Carlos Fittante specializes in Baroque-era dance, and often performs in full costume; this dancing provided healing after his partner died in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City. Similarly with other styles, like the Gothic or the Rococo, there was a revival of the Baroque during the 19th century. Neo-Baroque buildings, furniture, paintings, tableware, mantel clocks and other objects were created during the 19th and the early 20th centuries. After WW1, styles of the past were seen as \"dated\" or \"passé\", including the Baroque. The complex ornaments of these movements were replaced by geometric shapes and abstracted motifs, or just simple blank surfaces, in Art Deco, Bauhaus and mid-century design. Later, during the late 2000s, the 2010s and the 2020, due to the interest for vintage stuff and the appreciation of young generation for styles of the past, new Baroque-inspired objects were and are produced.",

A Basic Girl tends to love Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts, wear Ugg boots and yoga pants, a sense of authencity, and a varying degree of shallowness[1]. This aesthetic was created through a negative view of popular trends[2] seen mostly adopted by white teenagers and young adults, and is often used as an insult to these demographics. This aesthetic is often used by major media companies when creating female characters to make them more relatable to a larger audience. Artists like Klymaxx and Kreayshawn are among the first to use the term basic bitch in music in the very late 00s and the early 2010s. This term and its variations are also used by influencers like Lil Duval and Spoken Reasons, and these pieces of art and media often described a basic bitch as \"uncouth, uncool, and inauthentic\". It's original meaning has a similar definition of the popular 80s derogatory word 'airhead' but adds another more complicated level of trend following and racial tones. This type of woman and its criticisms swiftly grew in popularity in pop culture, especially in hip hop music. Social media also ran with the criticisms of basic white girls as images and old school format memes were shared and created. This popularization caused the term and its associations to be put under fire due to its insulting and shaming nature. Though the time it existed lived only between 2009 and 2016, the negative connotations of women following popular trends blindly lives on, although the terminology has evolved. The Basic Girl aesthetic is visually characterized by a combination of popular symbols and trends associated with a stereotype centered around romance, femininity and trendiness. It encompasses visuals such as Starbucks cups, Ugg boots, yoga pants, Jeeps, selfies, manicured nails, dyed blonde hair, Birkenstocks, Top 40 hits, Taylor Swift, iPhones, and an affinity for romantic comedies. These visuals often reflect a trend-following approach, embracing self-love and going with the flow. The aesthetic's visual appeal lies in the display of branded items, fashionable choices, and an inclination towards a specific color palette that may involve pastels. These visuals are frequently shared on social media platforms. Basic Girl fashion is often associated with pretty, feminine, comfortable and easily obtainable items that are usually cheap to produce and cheap to buy except for key brands that are known by name like Ugg boots. Fashion is the main key factor in identifying Basic Girls and are one of the more criticized elements of the aesthetic. Examples of the fashion include: Trendy girls can be seen through various forms of media, both online and on the small and big screens. Many pieces of media are also associated with Basic Girls as this stereotype often follows the most popular shows and movies in recent times. Many of the listings are associated with basic white girls at the time of origin, however, with the evolution of trends the associated media also evolves.",

It was developed during the 1980s. Respectivily, it is heavily influenced by the politics of the Basque Country and its culture. Musically, it is heavily influenced by Ska-Punk, Urban Rock and Reggae music. Coindicing and contrasting with La Movida in the rest of Spain, Basque Radical Rock was a really important influence on Spanish Rock music during the 1980s, especially in Bilbao. The singers and musicians associated with the Basque Radical Rock movement were heavily obscene, disrespectful and politically incorrect but in an ironic way[1], although it's worth noting that the area of the Basque Country was going through pretty though political times, including the presence of terrorist groups such as the Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA), and this was reflected in their music, some of which faced censorship due to its emphasis on offensive topics. Regardless, the singers were predominantly left-wing, aligning with the goals and causes of the original Punk movement. The term \"Rock Radical Vasco\"  was coined by José Mari Blasco in 16th of October of 1983, and it first appeared on his manifesto   that was published in the Egin newspaper. However, some people (regardless of being Basque patriots or not) didn't completely agree with the genre's name because of the principle that \"Punk Rock has no country or nation\". This can be considered true because of the fact that some musical artists from other parts of Spain also participated in Basque Radical Rock music. Additionally, this musical genre coincided with Las Movidas, which together implied social progress in Spain after the Francoist dictatorship. For example, Vulpess were the first all-female Punk band in the country. For some cultural insights, at the time the Basque Country was a political melting pot and protest songs were really popular at the time. That's why Basque Radical Rock songs almost always had an element of socio-political commentary. Compared to typical Punk Rock music, Basque Radical Rock definitely has much more violent and political visuals. This is reflected by some of its motifs, like guns, skulls or protests. This is likely due to the violent era the Basque Country went through during the 1980s and 1990s. The E.T.A organization, police brutality, the Spanish civil war and the Spanish Post-war period are often referenced in Basque Radical Rock songs. This is reflected in some songs such as No olvidamos, 3 de marzo by Soziedad Alkoholika, which references a police brutality incident in Vitoria-Gasteiz in 1976, or the song ETA by Eskorbuto, which references the terrorist organization of the same name (also leading to the song becoming subject to censorship). The red star is also one of the most common used motifs. This symbol traditionally represents Socialism, however in Spain, red stars are associated to separatist movements[2]. The flags of the Basque Country and Navarre are also widely used in contrast with its associated political ideologies. Scribble art is often used and other commonly used symbols include Anarchist symbolism[3] (such as the Anarchist symbol or Le Chat Noir), images of rebellious children, protests, blood splatters, paramilitar and terrorist imagery, upside down crosses, caricatures, etc. Basque Radical Rock is also notable for having its own Spanish grammar inspired by the Basque language: the letter C is replaced by a K (for example: Escorbuto becomes Eskorbuto) or Zs (for example: Sociedad becomes Soziedad). The main ideology that's common within almost all Basque Radical Rock bands is anti-establishment. The songs' lyrics often criticize society, the state (in this case Spain), the central government (in this case Madrid), the police, monarchy, the church, the military, NATO, etc. Many artists of the Basque Radical Rock movement were from poor backgrounds due to the economical crisis going on in the region at the time. The \"Industrial Reconversion\" in Spain also introduced highly fatal drugs such as heroin to the biggest cities of the country, leading to many musical artists dying from consuming them. The ideology of Basque Radical Rock really depends on the band/musical artists. Some bands embraced the Abertzale movement (Basque left-wing nationalism or separatism), while other bands were more anarchist-adjacent and rejected all types of patriotism or nationalism. Basque Radical Rock ended up becoming a really broad denomination with no true sense of political unity, because many bands and musical artists had their own values and musical techniques. For example, La Polla Records' songs were mainly about satirical and social commentaries, while Eskorbuto's music was more nihilistic (with the most famous example being the song Anti Todo), while Kortatu were Basque nationalists or Hertzainak who were situationists.

The biker aesthetic is not quite the bike itself, or anyone who rides one, but a specific type of style and attitude that is associated with it. The biker aesthetic is an image of toughness, roughness, sex appeal, and danger. Though motorcycles have been around since the 1800s (commercially, since the 1900s),  'biker culture' as we know it now has its roots in post-WWII. With the men coming back from service, motorcycle advertising changed to reflect a masculine aesthetic, with women being pushes out of the picture, or included only as passengers for sex appeal. This push was part of the post-war movement for men to return to their prior 'masculine' roles, with women returning to their 'housewife' duties. Although the reach of the aesthetic has spread across the world, it's mainly associated with America, Japan, and Britain. The aesthetics vary by region, though all share common aesthetics, such as the tough and ‘criminal’ association. Biker fashion changes culturally, but most incorporate leather, blacks and reds, studs, chains, jeans/denim, 'punk' styles, and 'edgy' styles. For women, there is usually an emphasis on sex appeal, while men emphasize masculinity and intimidation. Metal, hard rock, and punk music is usually associated with bikers.",

Bizarro literature can trace its roots at least as far back as the foundation of Eraserhead Press in 1999, but the description of the literature as \"Bizarro\" is a more recent development. Previous terms used to refer to the burgeoning scene include \"irreal\" and \"new absurdism\", but neither of these was used broadly. On 19 June 2005, Kevin Dole II released \"What The Fuck is This All About\", a sort of manifesto for the then unnamed genre. While the essay does not feature the word \"Bizarro,\" subsequent discussion about the essay led to the name as well as the inauguration of the Mondo Bizarro Forum. In his essay, \"The Nab Gets Posthumously Bizarroized\", Tom Bradley traces the genre's roots back in literary history to the time of Vladimir Nabokov's \"gogolization,\" and his cry of despair and horror at having his central nervous system colonized: \"...after reading Gogol, one's eyes become gogolized. One is apt to see bits of his world in the most unexpected places.\" Bradley claims the Bizarro movement is continuing and fulfilling that gogolization process, under the name \"Bizarroization\": \"...we have been completing the preposterous project which [Nabokov] took over from Gogol nearly a hundred years ago..\" Bradley further asserts that Bizarro writers can trace their spiritual roots back to the letters which Ovid wrote while exiled on the Black Sea. Bizarro visuals are inspired by the covers of Bizzaro Fiction books. This literary genre uses every and any color. It doesn't have an exact pattern, texture or effect, but it mixes pretty much anything together — like an apocalypse with monsters made of food, or perhaps a grape eating a human. Bizzaro fashion, like the visuals, is absurdist. Odd or impractical clothing is in keeping with this aesthetic. Fashion inspired by Retro-Futurism is also part of Bizarro fashion. Makeup is optional but if one were to use makeup with this aesthetic, it would have to resemble a monster from bizarro fiction or anything similar. However, fashion for Bizarro Fiction is optional because the aesthetic is more literary than visual. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

Venom's sound was closer to thrash metal, but laid the groundwork for future bands to polish, while Bathory was the first band to posess all the characteristic aspects of the black metal sound. The early years of black metal (approximately 1981 - 1987) was known as the first wave of black metal. Around this time, black metal was really just thrash and speed metal with satanic/anti-christian themes with the main difference in the music itself being the lower production quality. Then in 1984, the band Bathory was (if not the first) band in the scene to use the shrieked vocals that are commonly associated with black metal. other notable examples of first wave black metal would be Celtic Frost, Hellhammer, and Mercyful Fate. In the late 80s to mid/late 90s, there was a wave of black metal bands from Norway which revolutionized the genre and made black metal it's own subgenre. This was known as the second wave of black metal. The second wave of black metal was from approximately 1987 to 1997. One of the earliest second wave black metal bands was Mayhem with their first album \"Deathcrush\" being released in 1987. The second wave sound can be characterized by its shrieked vocals, tremolo picked guitars, and blast beats. And the visuals can be characterized by corpse paint, leather jackets, all black clothes, long black metal, beards (specifically goatees), black and white photos, and forests. Notable examples of second wave black metal would include Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, Satyricon, Emperor, and Ulver. Atmospheric Black Metal originated from the second wave in the early 1990s. The band credited for creating atmospheric black metal is the one-man band Burzum. The subgenre is a black metal with influence from dark ambient. Aesthetically, atmospheric black metal isn't as evil or satanic as traditional black metal. And focuses more on building soundscapes and atmosphere with themes of mainly Nature, mysticism, and spirituality. Visually, this aesthetic includes a lot of imagery of forests (specifically in Scandinavia) as well as animals that live in the forest. If you are trying to get into black metal, atmospheric black metal is a great gateway into the genre because it isn't as harsh or evil as traditional black metal. I'd recommend listening to The Mantle by Agalloch or Primordial Arcana by Wolves in the Throne Room as your first black metal albums. And if you separate art from the artist, I would recommend listening to Filosofem by Burzum. (Warning: The man behind the band Burzum, Varg Vikernes, is a murderer, church arsonist, racist, and a political extremist). Other notable bands include Ulver and Mgła. Blackgaze and Post-Black Metal were put under the same section due to the similarities between the subgenres and the very thin line between them. Blackgaze is a fusion genre that combines Black Metal with shoegaze. The genre is influenced by the atmospheric black metal of the 90s and emerged in the early to mid 2000s. Examples of blackgaze would include Alcest and Deafheaven, Post-Black Metal is music rooted in black metal that breaks the boundaries of the genre and often has influence from post-rock. A lot of the aggression from black metal is taken out of the genre, which makes some people skeptical if the genre can actually be considered metal. This subgenre also got the nickname \"Hipster Black Metal\". Bands would include Sadness, Deafheaven, An Autumn for Crippled Children, and Woods of Desolation. A lot of post-black metal bands are also depressive suicidal black metal (DSBM), which will be explained in the next section. WARNING: This section contains subject matter relating to self harm, depression, and suicide. If you are sensitive to topics of that nature, then please skip over this section and move to the next one. Depressive Suicidal Black Metal or DSBM is a subgenre of black metal with doom metal influence that emerged in the mid to late 90s and is audibly slow, repetitive, and dreadful with themes and lyrics about Depression, Suicide, Self Harm, and . Most artists of the subgenre use it as a coping mechanism to deal with and express the problems that they experience. The vocals are usually made to sound like the singer is suffering and in intense pain. The genre is meant to create a feel of hopelessness and dread. Some artists of this genre would include Austere, Silencer, Xasthur, and Thy Light. Unblack metal is a subgenre of black metal that originated during the second wave of the black metal. Audibly, this genre sounds identical to traditional black metal with the main difference being the themes. Unlike traditional black metal, Unblack metal is anti-satanic and pro-christian. Visually, this subgenre features crosses and other christian imagery. Such artists would include Antestor, Crimson Moonlight, and Horde. main article: Dungeon Synth While dungeon synth technically isn't black metal, or even metal, it's roots came from the black metal scene. The genre itself originated in the 1990s and the name wasn't coined until 2011. dungeon synth is a subgenre of ambient and focuses on medieval and fantasy soundscapes. A pioneer of the genre was Mortiis, who was the bassist of the band Emperor at the time, he is considered to be one of the first artists of the genre and released albums such as \"The Stargate\" and \"Crypt of the Wizard\". Another pioneer of the genre is Varg Vikernes, or his one-man band Burzum. After he was arrested in 1993, he released a series of albums from prison (these were known as his \"prison albums\"). These albums were completely made with a keyboard, because that was the only instrument he was allowed to use in prison.",

Bodikon is the direct predecessor of Gyaru, and virtually all Gal styles. The first “Gals” were Bodikon women, and the emergence of the first styles of Gyaru around 1993-1994 came largely from the “radicalisation” (described later on this page) of Bodikon style. Bodikon is therefore classified as “Gal”, and can be considered a part of the larger Ametora umbrella (which includes styles like Amekaji), though it does not typically emulate 1980s and early 1990s American fashion trends. This style was most popular in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s (usually around the period from late 1985 to 1994 at the peak of its popularity). The style was influenced by the Japanese economy at this time, as well as the widespread popularity of dance-based nightlife in Japan in the 1980s and 1990s (especially venues playing Italo Disco, City Pop, Eurobeat, Hyper Techno/TechPara, and House music). There are also parallels with the mid-1980s Japanese trend of the satirisation and exaggeration of American fashion and lifestyles. NOTE: The history described here is long and highly detailed. The body-conscious fashion presented by Tunisian couturier Azzedine Alaïa at the 1981 Milan Collection was the first of many experimental dress designs throughout the earlier part of the 1980s to attract attention internationally. By the mid-1980s (especially from the autumn of 1985 onwards following the signing of the Plaza Accord), Japan was reaching its economic peak in what became known as the “Bubble Economy”  (Baburu Keiki/Baburu Wa, バブル景気/バブルは).  The Bubble Economy was a very large economic bubble in Japan focused on asset prices, land prices and the Nikkei 225 stock exchange. It made Japan the 2nd largest economy in the world (after the United States) and the world’s largest creditor nation by 1988. It was caused by the Japanese yen rapidly (and artificially) strengthening against the US Dollar after the signing of the Plaza Accord in September of 1985. In response, the Central Bank of Japan slashed interest rates to 2.5% and held them there, making them the lowest interest rates in the world and also making credit available as never seen before in the history of Japan. In fact, the interest rates were so low that loans became practically free. Investors, suddenly with huge amounts of money to blow, plowed borrowed money into real estate and stock markets, shooting prices on a rapid upward streak, as well as borrowing against their newly appreciated holdings and buying even more. With both land prices and also salaries soaring in order to balance the real estate surge, by 1988 Japan’s total land value surpassed all of the land in the United States four times over. To highlight the extreme land prices, the total cash value of a single ward in downtown Tokyo (Chiyoda-ku) in 1988 could have purchased all of Canada- and the gardens of the Imperial Palace alone surpassed all of the land value in North America combined. Some of the most extreme land prices were found in Tokyo’s Ginza luxury shopping district- where land was sold for $250,000 (¥30,000,000 at the time) a square meter. The yen had become the world's powerhouse currency, and Japanese businesses also now found they held tremendous buying power overseas. It was widely feared in the West at the time that Japan would overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy. Japanese corporations, encouraged by the strong yen, began to develop a strong domestic economy in Japan - while also maintaining high exports of technology and cars to the United States.  These Japanese corporations were now outperforming American ones. Now, nine of the world’s top ten banks were Japanese - with Tokyo banks the world’s biggest and most powerful. By early 1989, by market cap, Japan accounted for 45% of the global stock market, far more than the US’ share of 33%, and eight Japanese corporations, five of them banks, were in the top 10 largest companies in the world, ranked by market cap. Encouraged by the booming economy, the Japanese public were encouraged by the government to spend - and they spent both massively and decadently. $500 cups of morning coffee drank by housewives and sushi were reported to have been sprinkled with gold dust in Nara and Osaka, in the belief it brought good health. After the release of the 1987 romantic comedy film “Take Me Out to the Snowland” (私をスキーに連れてって), there was a “skiing boom”, and ski resorts were constructed in huge numbers and filled to the brink with customers, resulting in very long queues. Imported cars such as BMWs, Mercedes Benz cars, Ferraris, Porsches and Rolls-Royces, especially left-hand-drive models (as this implied you had the money to import a LHD car to a RHD society like Japan), surged in popularity. It even got to the point where many Japanese women wouldn’t date a man who didn’t drive an imported car, claiming their arms were “allergic to the seats of a Japanese car”. Businessmen entertained each other with easily $184,000 worth of partying in a single night and bought gold bars as investments. People flew from Tokyo all the way to Sapporo just to enjoy a bowl of noodles and famously waved ¥10,000 banknotes and three fingers in the air on a Saturday night to get taxis, as taxis were so scarce due to the numbers going out on the town. Japan became the largest consumer market of luxury goods and there was even imitation of foreign European cuisines such as Italian food at restaurants around the country, resulting in the birth of “Itameshi” (イタめし) cuisine. The Japanese also went on a huge buying spree abroad - encouraged by the opening of the new Narita Airport, the Bubble causing appreciation of the yen, and plans to double overseas travel from 5 to 10 million Japanese between 1987 to 1992 by the government. The Japanese purchased large investments such as “virtually every skyscraper in Los Angeles”, a quarter of California’s whole banking market, major American companies (such as the purchase of Columbia Pictures by Sony in September 1989) as well as large properties in places such as Hawaii, Australia, British Hong Kong, the US and all over Europe (particularly in the south of France). There was even large-scale purchase of European art, such as the famous $39,921,750 purchase of van Gogh’s Still Life: Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers at the Christie’s London auction-house by Japanese insurance magnate Yasuo Goto on March 30th, 1987. At the time this was a record-setting amount for a work of art.  Another particularly famous investment was the purchase of the Rockefeller Center in New York by Mitsubishi Group in November 1989- raising fears of the Japanese buying up symbols of American capitalism. At the same time, Japanese tourists, often travelling in organised group-tours, were travelling abroad in increasingly large numbers - the number of Japanese people traveling abroad per year in 1986 (the 2nd year of the Bubble) was about 5.5 million, but four years later, in 1990 (the 5th year of the Bubble), it had swelled to over 10 million people. Particularly in Europe, Japanese tourists became second only to American tourists - and women in particular displayed a huge economic influence. Japanese women began to buy huge numbers of expensive luxury goods in Europe - one woman was reported to have bought an entire jewellery shop while travelling in Italy, while stores such as Gucci, Versace, Burberry, and even Harrods saw long queues of well-dressed Japanese women. Japanese tourists were especially shopping in huge numbers for Louis Vuitton and Gucci handbags, Savile Row and Armani suits (which new hirees often bought with their first paycheck) and the finest wines. All of these things made Japan an extremely rich and prosperous nation in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s, with both GDP and GDP per capita soaring to among the highest in the world, and becoming the world’s first and only “luxury mass market”. During the Bubble, Japanese companies, suddenly with a large amount of money to spend, were known to give generous budgets to the uniforms of female employees, representing at that point the fact a then-unprecedented number of women had entered the workforce. In 1985, just as the Bubble began, Japan introduced the “Equal Employment Opportunity Law” (EEOL), which brought significant public and social visibility to working women and to their aspirations for professional careers.  In the wake of the law, women assumed a much greater responsibility at work, and the balance of power between the sexes began to dramatically shift. With a new-found confidence in both the booming economy and workplace gender equality, the traditionally submissive Japanese workplace woman rapidly gave way to a highly assertive, opinionated, confident, bold, “executive” kind of woman - a new breed of female executive who could party almost as hard as her male colleagues had begun to do. Suddenly, Japanese women now had an extremely strong self-assertion, and were more likely to ignore the opinions of men and do what they wished. This “strong woman” figure became a trope in numerous manga at the time. In some estimates, 1/3 of women in the workforce worked as an “Office Lady” or “OL” (オーエル) for short. The OL was usually a young woman, usually around 20-25, who kept care of her appearance, performed secretarial and clerical work (this included cleaning the desks, answering telephones, making tea and greeting clients), and was obedient to her male colleagues. They were by intention meant to represent a beautiful image in order to represent the office, and so were often called an “Office Flower” at the time. Combining with the image-obsessed general feeling of the Bubble period, as well as the boom of the Japanese city of Kobe as a hub of fashionable, wealthy young women (in a style called the New-Tora[1]) a strong desire for luxury, sexy, daring and flashy fashion grew amongst Japanese women. Ironically, despite an increasing social progress of feminism, Japan had entered an era in which women were trying to regain their sensual femininity.  Additionally, by the 1980s, young women in their 20s had the largest amount of disposable income of any segment of the Japanese population, and as seen by the  “City Pop” aesthetic of the early 1980s, had a desire to spend extravagantly. This was only boosted by the “Bubble Economy”, as the Bubble’s strong sense of optimism, enhanced by the idea of Nihonjiron (日本人論) - widespread beliefs at the time that Japan’s case of economic growth was “thoroughly different to other countries” and that Japan was “different to other countries”- meaning that people believed that land prices especially would continue to rise forever after World War II. This even lead to the word recession being called the “R-word” during the Bubble, as the idea of recession in Japan became simply unthinkable. These kind of ideas provided young women with a strong confidence in their ability to find work upon graduation and in their future prospects in general, and led a lifestyle of pleasure and play. The Bodikon style as we know it today, while a nationwide phenomenon, first emerged in the city of Osaka in late 1985 and early 1986,  arriving in Tokyo and other Japanese cities in October and November of 1985. The general style was an immediate craze amongst young women, especially the OL, and by mid-1986 had become mainstream fashion in Japan - being worn on the street, by OL at work, at formal events, and even (secretly) at school. High school and college students were known to imitate the Bodikon style and the associated “Wanren” hairstyle (discussed later on this page). A key selling point of the Bodikon style was its sexy appeal, enhanced by its brash sexual style of flattering lines to the body (hence why Bodikon stood for “Body Conscious”) and usage of neon, colourful designs- involving usage of neon colours of red, purple, pink or yellow, often primary colours. This followed a general neon trend in 1980s fashion. Additionally, “DC” (an abbreviation for “Designer” and “Character”) brands began to take off from the early 1980s, and their youth-led, Shibuya-based stores began to sell Bodikon clothes from late 1985 onwards, marketed towards the young and affluent workforce that post-war Japan had produced. These affordably priced clothes began to permeate throughout the country and became a cultural staple of how the Japanese perceive the cultural impact of the Bubble Economy.  There were also influences of 1950s revival, apparent in the glamorous hairstyles popular amongst Japanese women and usage of furs in coats, bags, and accessories. This was most likely caused by the re-airing of popular 1950s movies such as “Kimi No Na Wa” (Your Name, 1953) by the Japanese public broadcaster, NHK, in 1985 and 1986. It is impossible to talk about Bodikon’s history without mentioning the influence of the Japanese nightlife scene of the same period. The Bubble Economy, as previously mentioned, resulted in a “spending boom” by the Japanese- and this was especially reflected in nightlife. At the time, going to the discothéque was popular in Japan, and during the Bubble a plethora of new discothéques opened. These discothéques were high-end, having a “luxurious” feel, and often requiring a dress code for both men and women. The staff would all wear tuxedos and the male customers wore suits. Female customers tended to turn up in Bodikon outfits, but anyone who disrupted the classy atmosphere of these discos was not allowed in. At the time, nightlife was a status symbol and to go to such popular and expensive discothéques was highly fashionable. In Tokyo alone, there were several “nightlife areas” that exploded in popularity - these included Roppongi (arguably the most famous district), Azabu, Aoyama, Shinjuku, Shibaura and Tamachi (the last two started to become increasingly popular in the late 1980s after they had been redeveloped and had large open areas of land left). Even though teenagers were initially excluded from the nightlife in the Roppongi and Azabu areas of Tokyo, whom aimed their nightlife at “classy” working adults, teenagers and students hungry for nightlife would illegally gather in many discos across Tokyo, with teenage girls often caught wearing Bodikon fashion there. These incidences sparked a craze for Bodikon in the teenage girl demographic, but also raised concerns from traditionalists who claimed Japan was losing its sense of morality to the crazes of money and decadence. Famous discothéques of the period included the Maharaja (マハラジ) chain of discothéques, the Juliana’s Tokyo (ジュリアナ東京) discothéque (in the early 1990s, and arguably the most famous and influential discothéque of the time. This disco is mentioned later on this page), and the King & Queen chain of discothéques. Others, among manym included the Turia discothéque in Roppongi, Akasaka’s Ronde Club in 1994 (infamous for its extreme style), and Shibaura’s GOLD discothéque (which operated from 1989 to 1995). At the time, discos like the Maharaja chain and later Juliana’s (in the early 1990s) were central meeting areas for those women participating the now-mainstream style. They became places for young women, often teenagers between ages 15-19, and college age girls (early-to-mid 20s), to let down their hair and have fun. Frustrated by Japan's male-dominated society, Bodikon women were often seeking self-expression, flaunting their sexuality after spending day after day working as OL intended to be obedient and subservient to male colleagues. The Bodikon was regarded as “ a new breed of woman”- independent and uninhibited, proud of her body, and assured in her sexuality. This resulted in two forms of the Bodikon fashion - a “daytime variant” of 1980s-style, neon designer power suits as well as more conservative bodycon dresses intended for the workplace and for wearing on the street, and a “nightlife variant” of the fashion that was a lot more revealing and sometimes had “barely-there” clothing (described later on this page).  “Wide shows” (ワイドショー), a then-emerging form of Late Night TV show that was a mixture of a news show, variety show, and a talk show, with an emphasis on 24-hour  live coverage, young female presenters and sensationalist gossip, first emerged at the beginning of the Bubble in the mid-1980s, and these “wide shows” (such as the highly famous “Tonight” (トゥナイト) variety show that ran from 1980 to 1994) often ran late-night TV specials that followed the Bodikon “gals” to discos such as the Maharaja, Juliana’s, and also places like Shibaura’s “GOLD” discothéque, interviewing them and videoing them sexily dancing and gyrating on raised catwalk platforms known as the the otachidai (お立ち台)- a kind of platform in the discos satirically named after the palace platform where the Japanese Imperial Family would appear, reflecting how the Bubble customer was expected to be treated like royalty, often driving male crowds crazy with their overtly-sexual dance moves. The otachidai first emerged from the “Gize” discothéque on the 3rd floor of the Roppongi Square Building, a building that housed prominent discos on virtually all of its floors, before emerging in the Maharaja’s Azajuban branch and then becoming a nationwide phenomenon, emerging at Juliana’s Tokyo at its opening in 1991. These Juliana’s TV specials, as well as the Juliana’s own “Juliana’s Live” show from December 1992 onwards that would air weekly to millions of Japanese (even being sponsored by Coca-Cola), sporting presenters such as the then-extremely popular American rapper MC Hammer, often had TV cameramen crouched below the otachidais in order to peep and film at the barely-covered underwear of the Bodikon women dancing - but most Bodikon women seemed to like the public exposure, viewing it as a liberation of their femininity. Additionally, there was another notable late-night TV show that was influential on the style - “Gilgamesh Night” (ギルガメッシュないと / ギルガメッシュ・ナイト). It was a softcore, late-night TV show that featured the most influential Bodikon women of the day - especially featuring the prominent Ai Iijima (who is discussed later on this page). Although aimed at a male consumer base, Gilgamesh Night actually mainly attracted a female audience intent on looking like their Bodikon idols. VHS Tapes of Bodikon women and their dance moves were also popular sources of inspiration, and during the peak of the boom in 1993 sold incredibly well. The late-night TV “specials” and the “Juliana’s Live” late-night TV show, alongside the Techno CD albums which Juliana’s Tokyo released (as the first disco to mix session CDs in six volumes) became gigantic cultural staples all across Japan - released in volumes from 1992 to 1994, they sold like crazy, having sales of 1 million copies and being a large part of the disco’s profit since the disco itself wasn’t very profitable as a business model despite the huge visitor numbers of up to 5,000 a night during its peak. They also came with a free ticket to Juliana’s, resulting in many people attempting to flood into Juliana’s using their album tickets. The cultural impact of discos like Juliana’s Tokyo during the Bubble period was phenomenal. Juliana’s in particular was a major social phenomenon - with people rushing from all over Japan, even from as far away as Kyushu and Hokkaido, to dance there.  The Opening night (15th May, 1991) was reported as “pandemonium”, with lines going on for entire streets and so much frenzy inside that they had to stop the music. Dozens of high school girls would watch the Juliana’s Tokyo dancers, almost all wearing Bodikon fashion, on the previously mentioned late-night “Wide shows” on TV and attempting to emulate their dancing and style. Female elementary, junior high and high school students were notoriously known to use their sofas as “mini otachidais” while the TV displayed the Juliana’s Live TV Specials, and they would shake their “Juli fans” while dressed in Bodikon, all over the country, especially on Halloween. These young girls attempting to be Bodikon women would end up forming the basis for Kogal later on.  Huge lines would form on the way from the adjacent Tamachi station to the Juliana's disco - the queues seemed to go on forever at the peak of the boom. One woman who had travelled all the way from Okayama to dance in Juliana’s told The Japan Times in May 1991:  “I’ve been lining up for more than 50 minutes [to enter the discothéque]”, while another woman who had travelled from Hiroshima stated “I came to Tokyo [just] to dance here.” It was even said by people that “Juliana's Tokyo is probably the only disco that the Imperial Family are visiting in the early hours of weekdays”. As a major cultural sensation, these discos promoted the Bodikon fashions that were widely worn amongst Japanese young women of the time on a large scale, however the women who wore the more extreme “nightlife variant” of the Bodikon fashion were never more than a small minority - and more of a subculture that became a symbol of Shibuya and Roppongi. For those who engaged in Bodikon however, it was much more than just the latest fashion. The body was adorned in order to be made into a “spectacle”, with an emphasis on \"collective sensation\". Being a Bodikon was a subcultural affiliation that determined many girls’ identities and self-hoods, and the idea of a subculture of fashion centred around women that would go onto to become the central focus of Gyaru, developed in Bodikon circles. These “Disco Queens” as they became referred to would after work meet their fellow Bodikon friends, go shopping for (often designer/luxury) clothes in Shibuya, particularly at Shibuya’s luxury “109” shopping mall, and change into their Bodikon clothing, famously in the train station bathrooms of Tamachi station - you could see scenes like this broadcast on Japanese national television at the time. The “Juliana's Tokyo” discothéque was located in a former warehouse in Shibaura, a bayside area in southern Tokyo that was undergoing redevelopment at the time and was desirable in the early 1990s due to its large plots of empty space, a rare commodity in overcrowded Tokyo.  Opened in May 1991 during the height of the Bubble Economy, at a cost of ¥1.5 billion, it was a joint venture by Wembly PLC, the largest leisure service group in the United Kingdom (hence Juliana’s nickname as a “British discothéque”) and Nishho Iwai Corp., a top Japanese trading company. Initially it was to be the flagship disco for a disco chain throughout Japan. The styling of the discothéque reflected its high-class, flagship status. Patrons first were checked at the door for age and dress (this dress code, previously mentioned in this article, being a very common feature of Bubble-era high-class discos), then they were let through the large fractured glass doors where they were greeted by six Japanese women dressed in miniskirts, bowing in unison. From there, the patron entered the large 1200 square meter dance floor. A chandelier made in California hung from the ceiling, which reflected the multicolored laser beams. A stage stood at the front of the room, and raised plexiglass platforms were placed periodically throughout the room where foreign professional dancers would take 15 minute turns dancing to the 26,000 watt sound system playing a variety of Techno, Rave, Eurobeat, and House music styles.  Juliana's originally started out playing Italo House and Italo Disco and quickly followed popular trends to Hardcore techno, which became the disco’s signature music style. The collection of new Rave and House genres, as well as imported European dance music, became known amongst Japanese clubbers as “Juliana’s Techno” (ジュリテク), alternatively known as “Hyper Techno”. Note that there was a difference between “Eurobeat” and “Juliana’s Techno”/Hyper Techno, although both were danced to by Bodikon women; Eurobeat was characterised by its melodic, poppy sound while Juliana's techno was characterised by a gloomy oppressive rave sound that was perfectly suited for hardcore dancing. Up to 3000 people at a time could be on the dance-floor and the VIPs could also retreat to lounges. There is a different “sound” of music attributed to each year of the boom - for example, in 1992, Hardcore Techno was popular, but in 1993 a more melodic, oppressive form of techno as well as house music were popular. By 1994, Eurobeat music was more prevalent. The Maharaja chain of discothéques was also hugely influential on the style, especially in the style’s earlier 1980s years. In the 1980s and 1990s, there were some 60 Maharaja discos in Japan, with flagship “Maharaja Gion”  known as \"the best disco in the East\". It was here that the fan-waving trend popular in the aesthetic started, when maikos (young Geishas) would go to the local Gion branch of Maharaja carrying feathered fans. Bodikon fashion was encouraged to flourish at the Maharaja as it earned Bodikon women free admission on “Ladies’ Nights”. Increasingly from 1987 onwards, women would dance in synchronised dance routines called “Para-Para” or more often at this point a hyper-Techno form of it, later known as “TechPara”. Para-Para/TechPara first emerged from the 1985 song “Take On Me\" by A-ha in the early days of the Bubble. People at Maharaja started to dance by fluttering their hands along with the lyrics of the song, and some people would match their dancing with eachother. This kind of dancing took off and spread to every disco in the Tokyo area. The staff at each disco started creating their own routines to songs, and customers went to discos so they could see the routines and learn them. TechPara was similar to Para-Para, being  choreographed, synchronised dancing using the hands and arms. Maharaja as such was known for the “First Para-Para boom” (mid-to-late 1980s), while Juliana’s became associated with the “Second Para-Para boom” (Early 1990s). The First Para-Para boom flourished until a notorious incident in the recently-opened Turia discothéque in Roppongi on January 5th, 1988, when a falling light killed 3 people in the disco. After this, the first Para-Para dancing wave ended, and the more extreme second Para-Para boom began. Wearing their Bodikon fashion, women (especially in Juliana’s) would often dance a mixture of freestyle dancing (influenced by the rave scene in the West) and this new Para dancing, on the otachidai (previously mentioned above). The otachidai had a height of about 130 cm, and was installed on both sides of the dance hall. The sexy dancing on the Otachidai - the focal point of the disco - often drove male crowds crazy, which Bodikon women found pleasure in - savouring their sexuality and leaving men powerless against the powerful, desirable woman. The Japanese media covered this extravagant partying extensively - on average 20 TV Crews a day, alongside the late-night TV shows, newspaper reports, interviews and even overseas media coverage - angering Traditionalists in the ruling political party, the LDP. Juliana’s in particular was believed to “ruffle official feathers” in Japan -  because some people believed that the women's appearance and behavior was immoral. The media would continue to give Juliana’s heavy air coverage regardless of what influential Traditionalists in the government felt, creating visiting Juliana’s into a major status symbol, and spurned on by the defeat of the LDP government in the 1993 election for the first time since 1955, created the impression of a “break” with the traditionally Japanese post-war norms. Despite the burst of the Bubble Economy in early 1992, the Bodikon subculture continued to prevail. At the time, Japan was in a sense of complete denial about the economic burst and continued to party on as if nothing had happened - in fact it took until early 1993 for the Japanese government to admit the Bubble had burst. In 1992, Juliana’s continued to soar to rapid fame and the fashion began to grow more and more extreme. The year 1993 is generally considered to have been the “peak year” for the style - by then the Bodikon women were so numerous, the media coverage was so intense, and the excess was so extreme that nearly every aspect of Japanese popular culture was affected by Bodikon women - from the late-night TV specials airing every night that drews tens of millions of viewers to infinite references in manga to the weekly tabloids detailing black and white pictures of the latest pasty-wearing women on the otachidais to the fashions even older women were donning by this point.  By this point, some of the crazier Juliana's fashion looked like a strip show. Girls were one step away from being completely naked, wearing pasties and string panties. Other parts of the country such as Nagoya and Kyoto were strongly inspired by the Juliana's boom and the discos with locations there such as King & Queen and Maharaja were even more extreme apparently, attempting to outdo the excess at Juliana’s - for just ¥100 (significantly cheaper than the Juliana’s fee), you could dance practically naked! This encouraged the development of a phenomenon called radicalisation - where the Bodikon fashion began to become very extreme. At the time, there were many prominent celebrities that embraced Bodikon fashion, that entered the public eye. These “Bodikon celebrities” were often “sexy” tarento (タレント) - which are notable television personalities in Japan, especially appearing as panellists on variety shows. “Sexy” tarento would be highly popular in the early 1990s. Others included models, “gravure idols”, and AV stars (what is notable is that Bodikon women often had links to the AV industry in Japan). More on the Bodikon celebrities is seen further down on this page. By mid-1993, the radicalisation of Bodikon style was getting beyond extreme - even in Juliana’s itself, which was markedly more modest compared to some of the other discos, and complaints were beginning to come in. Complaints from the neighbors included reports of rowdiness, girls changing into their Bodikon outfits in the alleys surrounding the disco, and in June 1993 a Tokyo magazine published photos (staged with professional models, the disco's management insisted) of nearly nude women dancing on the otachidai. An atmosphere of chaos was prevailing through the discos by this point - women saw dancing on the otachidai as a competition to compete for men and outdo each other, contributing to the rise of radical outfits to attract the most attention.  People used to fight for a place on the otachidai - elbowing each other and get in each other's way on purpose, and girls would pull each other's hair and burn each other with their cigarettes. Other women whacked other women off the otachidai with their Juli fans - this is humorously depicted in Yoko Kamio’s Boys Over Flowers manga (Hana Yori Dango, 花より男子), which was released at the time of all this going on. Additionally, the “radical” Bodikon fashion was now including public exposure of panties, on a special of the late-night TV show “Gilgamesh Night”, a tarento stripped down in public in central Tokyo to her underwear, and famously sometime in late 1993, a woman took off all of her clothes in a frenzy on the otachidai in Juliana’s in an impromptu strip-tease, nearly causing a riot on the dance floor. The (iconic) black and white photos of the incident  ended up in one of Japan’s weekly magazines and resulted in Juliana’s management being summoned by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department for a meeting in November 1993.  A police official who attended the meeting said: “We gave instructions that the otachidai is not a preferable place for customers to dance,\". According to Yoshinori Kasano, Juliana's chief business manager, the disco's management had also been thinking of imposing limits on the displays of flesh. In December 1993, Juliana's removed the otachidai and replaced it with a \"crystal stage\" on which professional dancers were to perform, and a dress code was instituted prohibiting excessively revealing clothes. Resulting from these incidents and now the crackdown on “radical” Bodikon by Juliana’s, from late 1993 people got the wrong idea that you could see girls stripping there, and so more and more perverted people as well as an invasion of girls from the countryside keen to see what all the fuss was about, who were often less sophisticated dancers. Because of this, attendance quickly dropped from 5,000 at a night at the peak of the boom to just 250 a night by early 1994. Bodikon was increasingly assumed to be a fashion of strippers - this probably wasn’t helped by the fact that numerous women in the AV industry were prominent Bodikon women.  Bodikon gals responded to the Juliana’s crackdown by frequenting even more extreme discos - these included “Ronde Club” in Akasaka, which became very popular at the end of 1993 and early 1994. Here, the most radical of Bodikon gals were to be found - an S&M theme was pronounced in the disco’s style, with whips used as dance accessories by the gals and women wore “O-Back” underwear, which exposed their buttocks. Other Juliana’s customers, disappointed by the loss of the disco as a status symbol, began frequenting other discos such as Maharaja and King&Queen, resulting in a new revival of Eurobeat music. Battered by the lack of business, Juliana’s attempted to give out large numbers of discount tickets and tried to get more customers to come but they were unable to get influential customers such as celebrities and wealthy Tokyoites like before. Bad influence on the club accelerated and they were only able to attract customers who didn't want to spend much money, and so the quality of customers went down and down. As the Juliana’s crackdown continued, they were also criticised for branding women who weren’t that radical in dress-code as “radical” and therefore banning them. A notable example of this was Kumiko Araki, arguably one of the most famous of the Bodikon celebrities. She stated that she never danced in her underwear, however was branded “radical” and was banned from entering the disco; this meant that she was not allowed entry to Juliana’s closing night in August 1994. In early 1994, Juliana’s announced it was to close at the end of August 1994 - in order to prevent the legendary name of Juliana’s Tokyo being “tainted” by recent occurrences. By mid-1994, Bodikon however was still flourishing; it was still the mainstream style of most Japanese young women and its aesthetic was now being made lucrative into other industries; Takara Tomy for example even released a doll in 1994 based around the Juliana’s concept, for young girls who wanted to emulate the glamour of the women depicted on TV. By 1994, Bodikon had also begun to receive new foreign media coverage; this included a French documentary on the lives of Bodikon women, and a November 1994 Vogue article dedicated to the “bad girls” of today’s Japan. The style began to rapidly radicalise as 1994 went on, with pieces of daring and outrageous clothing being worn - such as chokers, PVC clothing and a heavy inspiration from anime characters such as Sailor Moon. A variety of reasons can be also attributed to Bodikon’s decline, all largely tied to the bursting of the Japanese Bubble Economy.  These included the sudden loss of a large leisure income making luxury brands unaffordable, the decline of the optimism surrounding the Japanese economy, the closure of many clubs in the Roppongi area, as well as the decline of the company in the centralisation of Japanese life (as partying such as this was hugely based around company hours and often paid for by the company). The influence of Bodikon style can be seen in the mid-to-late 1990s styles of Gyaru, where the party-influenced culture and sexiness appeal is reflected. Additionally, many of the pioneers of Gyaru originally started out dancing in the Juliana’s discothéque, where lots of influence came from. After Juliana’s Tokyo, the last major hold-out of the style and of “Bubble culture” in general, closed on August 31st, 1994, Bodikon quickly vanished. With no central meeting area for Bodikon women left by September 1994, there was little justification to continue gathering in Bodikon circles. Shortly after, on September 2nd, 1994,  it was reported Japanese drug agents arrested the American-born president of Juliana’s Tokyo, Gary Wayne Callicott, and his girlfriend Michi Tsuchihashi for possession of $500 worth of illegal drugs, by coincidence on the same day the disco closed. With the name of Juliana’s already placed in bad press throughout 1994, suddenly there was now another bad association with Juliana’s and by extension Bodikon culture. In late 1994, Bodikon diverged into differing “Gal” styles - forming the birth of today’s Gyaru. The younger Bodikon women, mostly teenage girls trying to emulate the sexiness and sophistication of Bodikon culture were now by this point taking on a more “schoolgirl” aesthetic, encouraged to rebel by the growing moral panic in post-bubble Japan over enjō-kōsai (compensated dating) and schoolgirl sexuality - a symbol of the materialistic decay Japan’s national character seemed to have experienced. As such, while it had been socially acceptable to be a schoolgirl wearing Bodikon, dancing on an otachidai in the early 1990s, now that Juliana’s had closed the Japanese moral consciousness was beginning to recognise the Bubble was over - and with it came a “sobering” of morality. These younger Bodikon women and their growing interest in portraying themselves as “rebellious schoolgirls”, defying the moral panic and merging the adult-like nature of Bodikon women with the portrayed innocence of schoolgirls would end up forming the first post-Bodikon Gal style, Kogal. Other Bodikon women, especially those women who were the “Radical” Bodikon gyaru, were more interested in the values of extreme tanning that had developed in the culture around 1993-1994. With the Okinawan-born singer Namie Amuro receiving a lot of attention by late 1994 for her distinctive tan, it seemed that tanning was still trendy and popular. As such, radical Bodikon women continued to “radicalise” in their look after 1994, eventually getting to the point where by the mid-to-late 1990s it was so incredibly extreme it had formed its own Gal style, called Ganguro. Other Bodikon women, especially the older women who had emerged during the mid-to-late 1980s, were reaching their Japanese “marriage age” or generally becoming middle aged by the end of 1994. As such, encouraged by the “employment ice age” that had emerged by this point post-Bubble, many simply left their OL jobs and became housewives. The style however continued to survive in a (gradually getting smaller and smaller) number - evidence for this visibly exists in the late 1994 and early 1995 volumes of “Heaven’s Door”, where Bodikon women and Tokyo’s disco culture are evidently portrayed. In December 1994, a “successor club” to Juliana’s, Velfarre, opened, led by the same DJ as Juliana’s, DJ John Robinson. At first, Bodikon women seemed to dominate the club, however by March 1995 - when the last Heaven’s Door volume was published - it was evident the culture was on its way out,  if not had already made its exit; this was seen by Velfarre playing much more Trance music, a symbol of the growing mid-1990s Gal movement, instead of the more Bodikon-associated Techno (avex trax in the mid-1990s invested its money in Trance music and House music instead of Techno). By early 1995, when the Japanese public was left shocked by the lack of government action and widespread destruction during the Great Hanshin Earthquake in Kobe (the city’s infrastructure had been promised during the Bubble to be “Earthquake resistant”), as well as the terrorism of doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo terrorising the nation in the Tokyo Subway attacks, it was clear the mental image of the Bubble had been shattered, and with it, the culture of decadence and excess. By the mid-1990s, Bodikon were described as an “isolated tribe”, surviving in very small circles, and in 1995 the term “Juliana” was mentioned to be “dead”, with the term “Bodikon” gaining a more sexually-related meaning. However, in a 2002 article, there is mention of “Bodikon style” - whether this was a later Gyaru style that simply adopted the term or a small continuation of Bodikon disco culture however is left a mystery. Make-up included a light foundation, either a scarlet/dark red lipstick or a pink lipstick, and purple and blue eyeshadows in a single colour without any gradation. Designer lipsticks, such as a Gucci lipstick or especially a Dior pink lipstick, were very popular for this look. Eyeliner was black and clear, and there was heavy usage of mascara. Blush was diagonal and was orange, brown, or yellow. Bodikon women also had relatively thick (and slightly bushy) eyebrows -  it was mainstream to draw them much thicker than your own eyebrows. What was often done was drawing thick and dark straight eyebrows from the inside of the eyebrow to the end of the eyebrow using eye shadow, which couldn’t be as easily done with an eye pencil. Grey and dark brown eyebrow pencils were preferred for eyebrows around this time regardless of hair colour. After the Bubble burst, by the mid-1990s most women had very thin eyebrows - this process sped up when Tony Tanaka, a makeup artist, taught Japanese women the concept of trimming. In the Bubble period, women also had a strong    self-assertion, so it was said that it was better to have flashy make-up - it was not possible to easily look fashionable with a more “natural” make-up. Some Make-Up tutorials to help you out!! -> https://youtu.be/jcA8b4L6T1g (This one has English subtitles, and is probably the most useful one. However it doesn’t cover everything that a Bodikon woman would have for her make-up). -> https://youtu.be/18Cx6C1yD8c (This one has no commentary, but is a real, authentic make-up video from 1990 and therefore may be useful for getting the look just right!) Hairstyles, regardless of type, were generally always long, often reaching the woman’s knees or chest. At least 60% of women in their twenties kept their hair longer than their hip area by the early 1990s.The hairstyle that most Bodikon women wore by far throughout the Bubble was the “One-Length” or “Wanren” hairstyle  (Wanren, ワンレンボブ). This was where the hair was cut all in one length to create a mature, professional look, and was (extremely) straight and long. This hairstyle was popularised by idols such as Chisato Moritaka, and directly contrasted the “Seiko-chan” look of the early 1980s (popularised by Seiko Matsuda). The “Wanren” hairstyle was often paired with bodycon dresses or a power suit to form the “Wanren Bodikon” (ワンレン・ボディコン) set - this “set” was a crucial look in the Bodikon style and is often one of the most famous mental images of the Bubble Economy to many      Japanese people. The Wanren Bodikon set attracted a lot of attention from onlookers during the time. Wanren hairstyles were often paired with a type of bangs known as “Tosakamaegami” (とさか前髪) bangs - literally “rooster hair” in Japanese - that could either be straight or curled, and sat at the top of the head. These bangs were upright “like chicken combs”, with the bangs slightly hung down and sprayed to keep them in place. As with any fashion that originated in the 1980s, hairspray was a Bodikon girl’s must-have and many women wrapped their bangs in curlers, slept, and then the next morning, used a hairspray to keep the bangs in place before going out. Wanren hairstyles didn’t always have Tosakamaegami bangs, but it was very common. However in the early 1990s during Bodikon’s final years the Wanren hairstyle did soften and Tosakamaegami bangs started to be worn with the Wanren hair less and less. This kind of look can be seen on Makino Tsukushi in the early 1990s volumes of Yoko Kamio’s Boys Over Flowers manga (Hana Yori Dango, 花より男子). Another type of popular Bodikon hairstyle was the “Sauvage/Sovereign hairstyle”  (ワンレンソバージュ). With Sauvage meaning “wild” in French, this was a natural wave perm hairstyle with fine waves throughout the hair and lots of volume. This hairstyle was extremely popular in the mid-to-late 1980s and can basically be described as a Wanren hairstyle that was curlier. As Bodikon fashion’s heyday years were before the “Chapatsu boom” (茶髪/ちゃぱ) of the mid-1990s (when dyed brown hair, nicknamed “Tea Hair” due to its colour, went mainstream), most Bodikon women had black hair. However during the radicalisation of Bodikon around 1993-1994 (when Bodikon fashion started to become its most extreme and begin to resemble Gyaru), dyed shades of brown and even blonde hair became notable amongst Bodikon women, including famous AV idol Ai Ijima. With regards to clothing, the iconic Bodycon dress was extremely popular. It was generally considered the signature clothing piece of the style. It was almost always a neon or a generally colourful colour (the most popular colours were red or yellow) and was a mini dress that emphasized the lines of the body, capturing the femininity of the body. The Bodycon dresses of the Bubble period were characterised by being flashy and conspicuous, and the neon colours of the bodycon stood out even in central Tokyo at night. The more highly exposed bodycon dresses attracted a lot of attention from men. Encouraged by the “fitness craze” that was ongoing in 1980s Japan, young women dieted in order to wear bodycon and kept a sharp body. Bodikon women also had a high level of confidence in themselves by wearing bodycon. Bodycon dresses at the time were characterised by their clear appearance of cleavage, waist, and hip lines. The chest was often “wide open”, as women were encouraged during the Bubble to expose their cleavage, and the length of the skirt along the hip line was up to the thighs. It was initially only worn in discothéques and disco halls, before then being popularised as fashion wearable on the street by around December of 1985. Many Bodycon dresses at the time were sleeveless, and so there were a variety of bras worn by Bodikon women. Some women wore strapless bras, and some even wrapped bras with “bleached” colours to make the shape of the bust look good. Colours and patterns of bodycon dresses varied, but the most popular was a vivid bright red that matched the colour of the lips with the colour of the bodycon. In addition, there were many flashy colours such as yellow, pink, and purple, and by the early 1990s it was common to see women wearing “wild pattern bodycon”, such as leopard prints and zebra patterns. Sequin bodycon dresses were very popular, with blue sequins being especially popular. Women wore Bodycon dresses for a number of reasons; these included attracting rich men, not caring about men’s opinions at all and going all out crazy, or feeling confident and self-assertive in clothes that flattered their bodies. With regards to shoes, they were almost always high heels, usually being black and décolleté in leather with medium heel for a classy look. Furs, feather boas and a lot of gold jewellery would be worn alongside Bodycon dresses, often with luxury bags (such as Louis Vuitton or Versace bags) and gold chains. Chunky gold jewellery was very common and would be worn all over the chest area of the  Bodikon woman. There were numerous styles of Bodycon dresses, including the “Sexy Bodycon” style of string-bikinis and transparent dresses popular in clubs but inappropriate to wear on the street, but the most popular style, particular for daytime usage, was the One-Line style (ワンレン・ボディコン),  which was a little bit more conservative than today’s Western bodycon, but was intended to be a “mature” and “sophisticated” style with a closely-fitting dress, or a suit-set, that was usually in one bright colour and uniform enough to pass for office-wear. The One-Line style (or Wanren Bodikon in Japanese) was the type preferred for the daytime activities of Bodikon gals, and is also known as the Daytime Variant.  The One-Line style included the meticulous usage of the “power suit”, often colourful and with shoulder pads. This was considered a status symbol of business success for women, a highly desirable attribute amidst the success of the Bubble Economy. Sometimes a picture pattern, such as a pattern of Tokyo’s neon lights, would be worn on a power suit, but it was not super common. Power suits were worn nearly everywhere in daily life, from job interviews to nightlife to housework. “Sexy Bodycon” (also known as the Night-time Variant) became the prevailing Bodikon style by 1993 - with extreme style choices. Women wore neon-coloured string bikinis, transparent dresses as well as neon miniskirts, microbikinis and spandex, as well as extremely tight bodycon dresses with very short hemlines and often cut with revealing sections. By 1993-1994, neon-coloured PVC clothing, such as hot pink PVC miniskirts, were also highly popular in the disco scene. Pasties and string panties were often worn, sometimes even on the street. Women also wore large, customised belts and had long, often white gloves for a glamorous effect. Some of the more “radical” women - especially at Akasaka’s Ronde Club - even brought whips as dance accessories. Tanning was a major part of the radical look - along with dyed blonde and brown hair. The “Sexy Bodycon” look was popularised by influential celebrities in the Japanese media at the time - these include Ai Iijima, an AV idol who featured prominently on the late-night TV show “Gilgamesh Night” and  was a mainstream celebrity in Japan - men wanted her and women tried desperately to copy her sexy antics. Additionally, there was also Natsuki Okamoto, a race girl, who helped to popularise this sexy version of the bodycon look, even adding her own touch to the style with the “high-leg” look, which was a bathing suit cut to reveal all the thigh and hip. By mid-1994, Bodikon women were also utilising chokers in their look, and inspirations for nightlife clothing borrowed from popular anime characters such as Sailor Moon in style. Miniskirts were also popular, being usually paired with long stockings and gold chains, and were popular in both summer and winter. Both “collection” (luxury) brands and the DC brands in the relatively easy-to-purchase price range became very popular from the mid-1980s onwards due to the demand in the student disco party and office scene. In particular, Pinky & Dianne was worn by so many people that it was called the \"pin-die phenomenon.\" Famous DC brands included Alpha Cubic, Junko Shimada, MOGA, Zelda and Ingeborg (their 1980s and 1990s clothes can still be found for sale on online resellers like “Mercari”). Junko Shimada's colourful styles, particularly using colours like red and green, were “in-demand” for many young women of the time. Reflecting the new-found wealth of the Japanese, luxury goods and their brands were a key part of the aesthetic. At one point, any foreign brand was popular. Often, Japanese women would go to European countries and America, and sometimes Hong Kong if they were “poorer” (by Bubble Economy standards) to shop for luxury goods to wear. These included things from handbags, to necklaces, to even makeup, to the dresses themselves. In this period, showing off your luxury goods was a popular form of self-expression for many young women, and ownership of things like a Louis Vuitton bag or a Hermès scarf became a “rite of passage” into the booming middle class at the time. TIP ; For many outfits, you can simply use a simple bodycon dress or a power suit and it will work out fine! It doesn’t have to be ridiculously expensive!

It is often considered both a fashion style as well as a lifestyle that is often pursued by the middle class as a means of giving life a deeper meaning by living in the moment. The roots of Bohemianism as a distinct countercultural movement date back to the 19th century in Paris and surrounding areas, various years after the French Revolution. It is derived from the term \"La Bohème\", which used to be a slang term for Romani people living in France, who were thought to have come from the region of Bohemia in modern Czechia. In the late 2005 it was associated particularly with actress Sienna Millerand model Kate Moss in the United Kingdom and (as \"Boho-Chic\") actress and businesswoman Mary-Kate Olsen in the United States. Many elements of bohemian fashion became popular in the late 1960s and some date back much further, being associated, for example, with pre-Raphaelite women of the mid-to-late 19th century. Popular house decor includes tapestries, lots of plants, macramé plant holders, salt lamps, and any DIY projects; boho-chic embraces the 'here-and-now,' and so organization is not the primary concern of the bohemian style, instead in favor of observing the present and allowing yourself to leave things as they are when the next place calls you. They wear loose, colorful clothing and has been known as boho chic and hippie style. With their long flowing hair and rich, though threadbare fabrics, bohemians stand out in a crowd representing a colorful counterculture based on creativity. Chunky jewelry isn't uncommon. If you are emulating the bohemian aesthetic, please be mindful that although some have become 'accessories,' certain forms of dress and jewelry belong to indigenous people, whose ancestral culture and deserve to be respected and not appropriated. An often overlooked misuse of culturally significant pieces would be mimicry of American Indian dreamcatchers. Please allow yourself to be humble as you educate yourself about common cultural appropriation behaviors. If you are not descended from such cultures, then it is offensive to claim any tradition as your own. Bohemian style is all about embracing freedom and individuality, and the music that is often associated with this fashion trend reflects those values. Bohemian style music tends to be eclectic and diverse, drawing from a wide range of genres and styles. Some popular bohemian style music genres include: One of the main criticisms is the potential for cultural appropriation. The Bohemian aesthetic often draws inspiration from various cultures around the world, incorporating elements such as ethnic prints, patterns, and accessories. However, when these elements are taken out of their cultural context without proper understanding or respect, it can be seen as disrespectful and insensitive. The idealization of a carefree and nomadic lifestyle can overlook the challenges and hardships faced by individuals who are marginalized or living in poverty.

Its appeal lies in the delicate craftmanship related to ropework and leather as well as the exploration of power dynamics found in BDSM relationships, such as DDlg, Sissification, Pet Play, and more. Beyond its surface appeal, bondage as an aesthetic does focus on the tension between constraint and freedom, challenging conventional notions of beauty. Bondage imagery can be seen in many aesthetics such as Morute, Trailer Park Princess, E-Girl, Goth, and more. The bondage community developed a shared aesthetic with other aspects of BDSM such as power exchange and sadomasochism, due to the connotations of their practice and the aesthetic history of notable figures. This aesthetic is expressed in media depicting S&M relationships, graphic design for the community, and in fashion. Bondage fashion is heavily linked to the practices within the community.

While in nature some games can look similar to So Retro, others are basically copies of pre-existing 8-Bit and retro games and they may simply look \"cursed\" or \"off\" when compared to the actual licensed games. These types of games and consoles are usually sold on platforms like AliExpress, Wish, Alibaba and eBay, but sometimes also in gaming or antique physical stores. Although bootleg games are generally frowned upon by the Gamer community, there's also people who enjoy playing or collecting them. A similar concept in Japan includes \"Kuso-ge\", which refers to trashy games and the culture surrounding them (although they're not necessarily knock-offs). Please note this aesthetic is not meant to encourage, support or glorify the illegal activities commited by bootleg game manufacturers. The origins of the Bootleg Game aesthetic aren't easy to trace back because the creators of the bootleg consoles, cartridges and video games often hide their identities to avoid getting copyright-struck (similar to most participants in Shanzhai or ElsaGate). One of the earliest examples is Crazy Kong (1981) which was a copy of a Japan-exclusive version of Donkey Kong. Bootleg video games typically come from countries that aren't as strict about intellectual property as western ones, notably China, Russia, Vietnam or Brazil. The games they copy, hack or illegally use tend to be old games that already lost their license and legal protection, or those that are no longer widely sold in physical shops (eg: games for the Gamecube, PS1, NES, etc.). Other notable examples of games that are considered to be \"bootlegs\" but don't necessarily copy any pre-existing title include Hong Kong 97. This aesthetic/genre is closely related to the \"Shanzhai\" phenomenom, a pejorative slang term that emerged in China in the 2000s to describe counterfeit products and the culture surrounding them. Although bootleg games have come to be associated with mainland China in popular media, it's still important to not stereotype the country because many citizens don't approve of counterfeiting, and bootlegs are also widely produced in other countries where copyright laws aren't as strict. Bootleg Game influenced various aesthetics because of its wacky and low budget visuals, including Fotonight Web, So Retro and Xpiritualism. Other aesthetics it can overlap with include Dollar Store Vernacular. Each bootleg game or their manufacturers have their own stories. One of the most controversial consoles with a yet interesting history is Power Player Super Joy III. The console was approximately created in 1999, copying the Nintendo 64 model. In 2004 it became infamous because a man tried to sell them in the Mall of America (Minnesota, United States) and the FBI had to launch a raid on the mall to stop him from doing so. The console and its manufacturers were persecuted by the FBI throughout the country although it was later sold in Italy and documented by infomercials. Tropes and visuals seen in bootleg games include: In video games, a hack is when someone (typically a person or manufacturer but also companies) gains unauthorized access to a video game's code and edits them. Typically, the original games are edited until copyright laws are less likely to affect the bootleg product. Some changes made to the games may include the background music, the color palette, the characters, titles or sound effects. Some infamous examples of hacks include games like Osama Hunt (which hacks Duck Hunt) or Super Mario 14 (which hacks a Japan-exclusive game: Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3: Taiketsu! Zouringen). Hacks differ from mods because modded games are almost always based on open-source content and/or made with the creator's permission.

It first emerged during the 1950s as part of the Yanki subculture but has since moved on as an own custom bike culture. Bosozoku is believed to have originated from a Yanki biker gang known as \"Thunder Tribe\" (カミナリ族) that frequently made it into the news for their reckless driving and involvement in traffic accidents. In order to archive higher speeds, the members of the gang would remove the mufflers of their motorcycles, causing them to make loud noises akin to thunder while driving. During the 1960s, the amount of similar biker gangs continued to grow. In 1972, there was a flashmob of about 3000 yanki bikers in Toyoma City that demolished other people's vehicles, and as a result the media started to refer to biker gangs as \"bosozoku\". The Japanese word \"boso\" originally meant \"to lose control\", but in the context of bosozoku its meaning is more along the lines of \"road rage\". Members of bosozoku gangs often wear large coats known as \"tokkofuku\" (特攻服) that feature embroidery related to their gang membership and are only worn during outings and graduations. As their name implies, they are inspired by the wear of kamikaze pilots. As tokkofuku feature extensive embroidery that costs a fortune to get made, they are often hand-me-downs from retired to new members as part of the hirachy. There is a stereotype that the kanji on these coats are often nonsense phrases such as \"night dew death agony\".[1] Bosozoku gangs not only consist out of men, but also women. Just as how male members have long moved on from the stereotypical Yanki looks so have the female members from Sukeban. They often match their outing outfits to the custom paint job of their bikes and visa versa down to the acrylic nails. TBA",

The term is used with both positive and negative connotations, as becoming part of the bourgeoisie can be a goal for many, yet offensive to the many others that are opposed to the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie are also called capitalists, due to them being the ruling class of capitalist society and owning capital (money, machinery, and other resources used to create more wealth). Hence, this aesthetic is most often associated with celebrities and wealthy business owners and their heirs. Boujee people are concerned with wealth, status, and all thing luxury. They'll often show off, or \"flex\", their wealth on social media to gain notoriety and followers, or \"clout\". Often these flexes will include expensive spa trips, high-end self care and cosmetics, buying expensive foreign vehicles or mansions, trips to luxury resorts and beaches, and more activities of this sort. On the other hand, boujee people can also be portrayed as living isolated in luxury while ignorant to the struggles of the rest of society.\nBoujee people typically radiate confidence and esteem, and can be very charitable. However, they can easily turn to narcissism and entitlement. In any case, hedonism and living life on their terms are some of the main values of boujee life.

It is high-end fashion that is constructed by hand from start to finish, made from high-quality, expensive, often unusual fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finished by the most experienced and capable sewers, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Boujee fashion also tends to be chic, elegant, and stylish way that’s associated with a fashionable lifestyle, ideology, or pursuit wearing the latest.

It focuses on relatable experiences, genuine connections, and a sense of comfort, evoking a nostalgic and wholesome atmosphere. The Boy Next Door aesthetic emerged in popular culture during the mid-20th century, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. It was influenced by the rise of suburban living and the idealization of wholesome, \"all-American\" values. This aesthetic portrayed the boy next door as the epitome of an ideal neighbor and romantic interest, embodying qualities such as kindness, simplicity, and approachability. Over the years, the aesthetic has evolved and been reinterpreted in various forms of media, including films, television shows, and literature, continuing to resonate with audiences who appreciate its nostalgic and relatable qualities. In terms of fashion, the Boy Next Door aesthetic embraces a laid-back and effortless style. It often includes well-fitted jeans or khakis, plain t-shirts or button-down shirts, and comfortable sneakers or loafers. The color palette typically consists of neutral tones such as beige, gray, and white, with occasional pops of denim blue. The key motifs of the Boy Next Door aesthetic revolve around the everyday life of an average young man. It celebrates mundane activities, such as hanging out with friends, playing sports, or enjoying outdoor hobbies. The aesthetic appreciates the beauty in simplicity and finds charm in the ordinary. Boy Next Door fashion is characterized by its casual and laid-back style with a touch of preppy and clean-cut elements.

Media that aligns with the Boy Next Door aesthetic includes romantic comedies, coming-of-age films, and slice-of-life TV shows that depict ordinary experiences and relationships. Brands like American Eagle, Gap, and Levi's are often associated with this aesthetic, offering clothing that embodies the relaxed and approachable style of the Boy Next Door. Critics argue that the aesthetic often presents an idealized and unrealistic version of romance, focusing on a perfect and effortless love story between the boy next door and the protagonist. This can create unrealistic expectations and may not accurately reflect the complexities and challenges of real-life relationships. In some cases, the \"boy next door\" aesthetic may rely on shallow characterizations, emphasizing surface-level qualities and romantic tropes rather than delving into deeper emotional connections and complexities of relationships. This can lead to one-dimensional portrayals of romance. WIP WIP WIP WIP The Boy Next Door aesthetic is closely related to the Girl Next Door aesthetic, as both represent a wholesome and relatable image of youth and neighborly interaction. It shares common elements with other aesthetics such as Cottagecore, which emphasizes a nostalgic and rural lifestyle, and Normcore, which embraces simplicity and blending in. Under Construction",

It was used for several purposes (mostly by corporations), being incredibly popular during its era. It was utilized for interior décor, architecture, graphic design, clothing, consumer electronics, and media. Bright Tertiaries is primarily centered around a tertiary color palette (lime green, fuchsia, orange, and teal). It began to fall out of mainstream use in the early 2010s, design trends experiencing a major shift from Frutiger-esque maximalist designs to Minimalistic philosophies such as Flat Design. Bright Tertiaries' earliest stylistic roots can be traced back to Memphis Design in the 1980s, both aesthetics making use of blocks of contrasting color. Bright Tertiaries emerged in the Mid-2000s during the period when the Frutiger Family of aesthetics were emerging into the mainstream and '90s aesthetics such as Y2K Futurism were in decline. It was in response to the \"anything goes\" philosophy of Late-1990s/Early-2000s aesthetics, opting for a more refined, \"humanistic\" look. Bright Tertiaries was utilized in a variety of ways such as interior décor, architecture, graphic design, clothing, consumer electronics, and media; interior décor and architecture in particular were very prominent, a large portion of these being within educational grounds such as schools or colleges. Due to its sheer abundance and variety, Bright Tertiaries is almost synonymous with the zeitgeist of the 2000s, being a part of what most consider nostalgic about the decade. During its prime, Bright Tertiaries was almost omnipresent in most aspects of everyday life, similar to Frutiger Aero and adjacent aesthetics. Bright Tertiaries experienced an increase in use in media such as video games and movies, as well as variants of consumer electronics; these color variants overlap with Four Colors, a related aesthetic that has a similar color scheme to Bright Tertiaries. At the beginning of the 2010s, the zeitgeist and overall optimism of the 2000s were fading. This manifested itself in prominent 2000s aesthetics such as Frutiger Aero, Frutiger Metro, and Four Colors falling out of mainstream popularity in favor of a more minimalistic era encapsulated by Flat Design, and later Corporate Memphis. By 2017, Flat Design was established completely. Frutiger Aero (also known as Web 2.0 Gloss) is a broad design style and aesthetic that was prevalent in advertising, media, stock imagery and technology from roughly 2004 to 2013, following the end of the Y2K Futurism era and overlapping with the McBling, Surf Crush, and Electropop 08 aesthetics. It is characterized by its vast use of Skeuomorphism, glossy textures, cloudy skies, tropical fish, water, bubbles, glass, lens flare, sprawling patterns, \"humanism\", aero glass, bokeh, Frutiger fonts, Abstract Tech, auroras and bright, vibrant colors (usually greens and blues). Bright Tertiaries and Frutiger Aero are related due to their similar visuals, overlap including nature iconography, humanism, sprawling patterns, and a tertiary color palette. Frutiger Metro (also known as Flat Frutiger Aero, Vector Metro, or Vector Vomit) is a broad aesthetic that encompasses the \"Frutiger\" vector-based graphic designs of the 2000s. These designs share a lot of similarities with Frutiger Aero and other aesthetics of the time. Unlike Frutiger Aero which contains large amounts of depth and texture, Frutiger Metro is flat. Frutiger Metro and Bright Tertiaries often incorporate the same themes, such as sprawling patterns, flat blocks of color, and nature iconography. Four Colors was a frequently used color scheme found in consumer products and consumer technology during the Mid-2000s to the Early-2010s, first primarily seen around 2004 as a part of Apple's iPod \"Silhouette\" advertising campaign. It is a subgenre of Superflat Pop and Frutiger Aero and prominently consists of the colors electric lime, sky blue, hot pink and neon orange, similar to the tertiary color palette used in Bright Tertiaries. Four Colors is popular in Japan with stores and brands such as Daiso, Sony and Fujifilm. Technozen, short for Techno Kawaii Zen, (alternatively referred to as Yuki) is an aesthetic primarily inspired by the aesthetics of Mid/Late-2000s Japanese technology. It can be described as cold, sterile, and professional looking, and at the same time, cozy, friendly, and cute. It is the Japanese counterpart of Frutiger Aero and it is described as a sub-aesthetic of it; however, Technozen is largely evocative of Asian design while Frutiger Aero is more global. It is similar to Bright Tertiaries in its soft, clean, and sterile designs. Bright Tertiaries visuals follow the 2000s trend of incorporating colors that invoke feelings of nature, flourishes, naturist patterns, and a general consumer friendly \"humanist\" feel. This is very similar to aesthetics that were mainstream during the same time such as Frutiger Aero, Frutiger Metro, Four Colors, and Technozen; these similarities often cause a lot of overlap between Bright Tertiaries and the previously mentioned aesthetics. Common motifs for Bright Tertiaries visuals include: Interior décor most commonly utilizes flat blocks of color, a singular object usually only being one hue; this description can also be applied to the architecture. Occasionally, minimalist patterns similar to Flat Metro (a Frutiger Metro subgenre) will be employed. Clothing that falls under Bright Tertiaries mostly use flowers and simple/childish patterns, black being a common background color. Due to this, clothing that falls under this aesthetic is usually intended for women or young girls/infants. These patterns share similarities with Frutiger Metro and Vectorgarden. Consumer Electronics featuring Bright Tertiaries mostly overlap with Four Colors due to their shared color scheme and their tendency to use flat blocks of color. The color scheme is a little looser, employing colors outside the general tertiary color palette to a small extent.",

Nitro's stage was distinguished from the competitors with industrial steel branding and complex scaffolding. In 1997, the World Wrestling Federation debuted the Titantron stage, which would see incremental changes with each passing year, such as trons on the stage's edges and a website logo. The stages for WWE and WCW at the time incorporated gritty graphics that included  flaming trash barrels and steel fences. WWE used additional imagery for its sets and graphics during the Ruthless Aggression period, such as broken glass, concrete, and brushed metal.

Bubblegum Bitch was strongly influenced by 2000s American pop culture, and takes some visual and philosophical inspiration from McBling. Bubblegum Bitch is like a mix between McBling, Baddie (especially luxurious), and Bimbocore. A point of confusion based on this aesthetic is parody artwork and clothing featuring cartoon characters like Hello Kitty or Barbie/Bratz dolls using swear words or referencing sex. Despite what they may seem, these things are not technically Sanriocore, Bimbocore, or Barbiecore, although they can be similar as mentioned. Bubblegum Bitch is also similar to the ‘baddie’ subtype of the Babygirl aesthetic. Bubblegum bitch fashion generally uses highly saturated colors, particularly pink, purple, and white, and stereotypically feminine style. Fashion tends to be revealing, adult styles occasionally though it might not always be so. Often features typically \"innocent\" and/or pretty characters like the Bratz Dolls, Powerpuff Girls, Jigglypuff, Hello Kitty, Barbie, My Little Pony characters, and various others. Typically \"childish\" accessories and accents like barrettes, glitter, hair ties, and candy jewelry are sometimes used. These are typically paired with more serious and adult style choices, like chokers, chains, and accessories. Clothing and accessories with swear words, statements relating to politics, sexually suggestive words and phrases, and musings on mental health printed on them are popular. Light pink is the most significant color in the Bubblegum Bitch aesthetic, but many other shades of pink are prominent as well, along with the following colors: This is a list of object visuals associated with the bubblegum bitch aesthetic: Bubblegum Bitch media is more jaded and sexual than that of the other hyperfeminine aesthetics, Barbiecore, but it lacks the hard partying and drug culture of a similar aesthetic that also inspired it, McBling.

It's characterized by its youthful and playful style, happy sounds and cheesy lyrics, and childhood nostalgia. The genre was at its peak popularity from the 1990s And 2000s. The term was coined by Eurodance fans to denominate a very specific type of Eurodance music characterized by their childish aesthetic[2]. In popular media and internet culture, this musical genre tends to be associated with Shanzhai merchandise (as many Bubblegum Dance songs were featured in bootleg kids' toys from China[3][4]), Y2K Futurism, or the 2000s Virtual Singer aesthetic, which mostly consisted of CGI mascots singing and dancing Bubblegum Dance tunes. However, it also greatly shaped the Japanese rhythm game industry, with various tracks being featured in video games such as Pop'n Music or Dance Dance Revolution. Bubblegum Dance music first appeared in the 1990s in Denmark, and was also produced throughout all of the Scandinavia area, with many musical artists and bands originating from there, but it was also popular in the Netherlands and Germany, and in Italy, where it received the name of Bubblegum Italodance.  The musical genre also developed a large fanbase in Japan, mainly because Bubblegum Dance songs were featured on several Japanese rhythm games such as Dance Dance Revolution, which gave visibility to Bubblegum Dance artists such as SMiLE.DK or Miss Papaya, and many Bubblegum Dance songs were featured on AMVs and Anime memes from Nico Nico Douga.  It also is known to have a large fanbase in China, mainly because a lot of Bubblegum Dance songs were featured in bootleg Chinese toys and many Bubblegum Dance artists made covers out of Chinese songs for kids. The first Bubblegum Dance song ever released is arguably Saturday Night by Whigfield, released in 1993. With the popularity of said song, various musical artists from Europe took inspiration to make happy, childish and energetic music, deriving into the Bubblegum Dance musical scene. Bubblegum Dance music became prevalent in the late 1990s and early 2000s during the Y2K Futurism era thanks to iconic musical releases such as \"Dub-I-Dub\" by Me & My, which went viral due to its non-sensical lyrics (Dub-I-Dub-Doobi-Doo-Pa-Pa) and its fast and catchy rhythm. This way, it became inspiration for lots of Eurodance artists from Europe. Later, another iconic song was released, \"Barbie Girl\" by Aqua, which became a Top-1 track around the world, selling over 8 million copies. That encouraged lots of artists to write songs with a similar style, topics and aesthetics. The successor genre of Bubblegum Dance is considered to be Teen Pop[5] from the 2000s. In the 2020s, as the Y2K revival movement appeared among young people, some Bubblegum Dance songs (such as Bumblebee by Bambee, Superstar by Toy-Box and Barbie Girl by Aqua) went viral again on social media sites like TikTok or Instagram, slightly revitalizing the popularity of the genre. Some songs have also been used in memes. The visuals associated with Bubblegum Dance music can mainly be noticed in MVs and song/album cover arts. \nSome common motifs of Bubblegum Dance visuals are: The fashion used in Bubblegum Dance MVs is similar to Raver and Cyberpop fashion, with a childish touch to it. \nSome common characteristics of Bubblegum Dance fashion include: Bubblegum Dance songs are characterized by: Bubblegum Dance-Pop, also known as Bubblegum Pop, is a subgenre of Bubblegum Dance that appeared during the late 1990s, and it takes influence from Teen Pop music and a few other Pop subgenres. Compared to its sister genres (Bubblegum Dance and Bubblegum Italodance), it's less electronic. The most common characteristics in Bubblegum Dance-Pop are: Bubblegum Italodance is a subgenre of Bubblegum Dance, and as the name suggests, it refers to music made in Italy, with influence from the Italodance musical genre. Bubblegum Italodance music was at its peak in the 2000s, when its production skyrocketed. Most Bubblegum Italodance music was sold in vinyl records during the 1990s and 2000s in Italy, leading many songs to become rare or get lost. Bubblegum Italodance is considered different from other forms of Bubblegum Dance due to its unique musical characteristics, and some of these include: Since the Bubblegum Dance scene is closely related with the Anime fandom and the rhythm game community, many Bubblegum Dance songs are featured on Japanese rhythm games, anime MVs/edits/memes and nightcore remixes.\nSome of these video games are: Due to the childish style of Bubblegum Dance, some assume that it's a musical genre aimed at young children; however it's actually not necessarily for kids. Consequently, some songs with erotic or sexually suggestive topics and lyrics have been criticized, but they're supposed to be for adults. This is because Bubblegum Dance as a genre has no target audience. For example, many lyrics in works by the Danish band Aqua have double meanings, including their hits like Barbie Girl or Lollipop (Candyman).",

At The Disco  Dresden Dolls  Moulin Rouge The Burlesque aesthetic has a rich history that dates back to the 17th century, undergoing various transformations to become the bold and flamboyant style associated with modern burlesque. This aesthetic has also inspired artists like (early) Panic! At The Disco and The Dresden Dolls and influenced their performances and visual identity. A burlesque is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects. The word derives from the Italian burlesco, which, in turn, is derived from the Italian burla – a joke, ridicule or mockery.It often involved exaggerated and risqué humor, as well as scantily clad performers. Early burlesque shows were popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, and they frequently parodied highbrow literary works and classical theater.  In the 19th century, burlesque evolved into a genre that focused on elaborate musical and theatrical productions. These shows were characterized by their combination of humor, extravagant costumes, and lively performances. However, they maintained a certain level of sophistication and often featured well-known stories with a comedic twist. Burlesque experienced a decline in popularity in the early 20th century due to changing social norms and the rise of other forms of entertainment. However, the early 21st century saw a revival of interest in burlesque, This modern take on burlesque embraced elements of satire, sensuality, and empowerment. Performers often used elaborate costumes, choreography, and theatricality to entertain and challenge societal norms. The rise of the aesthetic can be traced back to the popularity of the film Moulin Rouge, and the song Lady Marmalade which was recorded for the soundtrack of the film. This then was followed by a resurgence in the burlesque aesthetic in terms of music videos and films such as Tim Burton's Big Fish and the music videos for Mr Brightside and Chelsea Dagger. American rock band Panic! At The Disco's first album A Fever You Can't Sweat Out was heavily inspired by burlesque and cabaret elements, shown in the lyrics, performance and fashion that the band wore at the time. The burlesque aesthetic can be most clearly seen in their music videos But It's Better If You Do and Build God, Then We'll Talk, as well as throughout their live performances - best shown for their infamous show, Live In Denver. Panic! At The Disco's aesthetic at the time definitely helped to popularise the aesthetic in the mid-2000s, and still inspires people to dress so today. The band showcased a blend of theatricality and a playful sense of drama reminiscent of burlesque performances. The use of ornate costumes, intricate makeup, and over-the-top settings in their visuals draws parallels to the theatrical nature of burlesque shows. Some defining elements of Burlesque fashion would be",

Cabincore is an aesthetic that romanticizes the life of residing in a cabin. Similar to Cottagecore, Naturecore, and Adventurecore, Cabincore embraces the idea of getting away from bustling industrial life, favoring places where days can be spent in a more remote setting. The aesthetic features a rustic, relaxing, warm cabin theme. Since Cabincore is associated heavily with being calm and relaxed, cozy clothes are a staple. Primarily folk, folk-rock, and indie-folk.

As described by Susan Sontag, the academic who codified the term, its characteristics are: \"artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and shocking excess\".[1] It is utilized in multiple mediums including film, fashion, theatre, music, and even modes of speech. The aesthetic concept is popular within the gay community because of gay men being perceived by mainstream society as less masculine and worthy of ostracization. Camp becomes a way for them to exaggerate the effeminate and taboo parts of themselves as a rebellion against what society perceives a man should be, and the culture's behavior and camp inform each other. For example, drag shows, the gay \"accent,\" and cult films popular within the LGBT community such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show are examples of camp. Defined by Merriam Webster: \"Absurdly exaggerated, artificial, or affected in a usually humorous way.\" This Definition gives the \"Campy\" aesthetic an incredibly wide reach, while still fitting within the genre. While many things can and do fall within this definition, there are some that are deeply associated with \"camp\". The \"Campy Horror\" genre is incredibly popular, with countless pieces of media that fall within it. Older film such as Film Noir, 50's movies, and other such media have a campy aesthetic when viewed today. The Flapper Aesthetic, Great Gatsby, and Art Deco all very often fall into the genre of camp when portrayed in media. Much of 80s media is loaded with camp, and was part of the culture then as well as the current appreciation of it now. Drag is commonly associated with camp, and has been adopted by the community. Camp is Very common within theatre. Camp is a very effective tool in parody media, and is used by artists such as Mel Brooks and Steve Martin. Intentional Camp. Unintentional Camp. While not meant to be camp, it still hits all the boxes. There are no \"official visuals\" of camp, as the word itself needs to be used in the context of who is performing camp. For example, Marilyn Monroe's white dress flaring up in the subway grates is not camp itself, but when another person mimics her actions in a highly exaggerated parody, it will be considered camp. This is especially true if the person doing the Monroe parody is doing so in a way to mock the white male gaze. It is also difficult to classify visuals because camp is unlimited, and highly dependent on the individual's unique perspective.",

        "description": "Cannibalcore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Colors\nRed, pink\n\n\nKey Values\nCannibalism as a metaphor for love, obsession, sex and ownership of the body\n\n\nRelated Aesthetics\nGorecoreHorrorMeatcoreYandere\n\n\nCannibalcore is an aesthetic that romanticizes cannibalism and consumption of others or the self as a metaphor to explore love and obsession, or the feeling of wanting someone or something so much that you want to consume it. There are also multiple common motifs found within this aesthetic, as the community is based upon shared interests in certain books, films, and prestige television series; Hannibal being the most explicit link to the link between cannibalism and love. In addition, Catholicism and the concept of transubstantiation, art house horror, and poetry popularized this culture. It is important to note that people who are interested in this aesthetic do not support or participate in cannibalism, but rather use the dark subject matter to reflect intense feelings about love and the body. While characters and stories involved in this aesthetic may participate in cannibalism, this aesthetic in no way condones real-life cannibalism. The introduction of a cannibal motif on Tumblr began with users spreading the popularity of the television series Hannibal (2013) in 2020, both before and after the pandemic. While the show was discussed on Tumblr while it was airing and often linked to Superwholock (the shared fandom of Supernatural, Dr. Who, and Sherlock,) the new crowd used the lens of literary/film analysis, rather than only the lens of fandom. In these discussions on Hannibal, users explored Hannibal's murders as a manifestation for his love for beauty and, later, romance with protagonist FBI agent Will Graham. This popularized the motif of cannibalism as an act of love to Tumblr. Fans of the show expounded on this motif through web-weaving/parallels/comparatives, which are photo sets of artworks, literary quotes, poetry, etc. to unite a motif. Other fanworks such as edits with quotes superimposed over an image, collages, and fanfiction also reinforced this interpretation of Hannibal, which the show creator intended the audience to come away with[1]. As Hannibal's revival naturally declined in popularity, many users explored other drama and horror works that also had love, sex, obsession, and devotion at the center of its thesis, with cannibalism not necessarily being included in all works. Some examples are seen below in the media section. This aesthetic generally uses the metaphor of cannibalism to convey the idea of consuming and being consumed by love. However there are several ways this can be interpreted based on how one uses the aesthetic. First, there is love as obsession; similar to the Yandere aesthetic, some people may use cannibalcore to express a love for another person or thing that is so intense that they want to bite, drink or somehow consume the object of their affection. Examples of this are common in music by artists such as Jazmin Bean and Melanie Matinez. Another way to interpret cannibalcore is by using it to express the idea of sacrifice or selflessness in love. In a metaphorical sense, individuals may be willing to \"consume\" or give up parts of themselves for the sake of the relationship. This sacrifice can be seen as an act of devotion, where the well-being of the partner becomes as important as one's own. This can either be portrayed as romantic, or in a less positive light, may be used to show a codependent or emotionally abusive relationship. It is usually, when utilized in a non-toxic manner, used to reference an intense relationship where one or both partners sacrifice their health, relationships, values, etc. for each other. In feminist literature and film, the metaphor of cannibalism as a representation of love has been employed to critically examine women's bodily autonomy and the societal expectations placed upon them. The metaphors used in cannibalcore can be used to express the ways in which women may feel consumed or subsumed by societal norms, gender roles, and oppressive expectations. One interpretation of this metaphor within feminist contexts is the idea of women being metaphorically \"consumed\" by traditional gender roles and societal expectations. Women have historically been expected to conform to certain ideals, sacrificing their individuality for the sake of societal norms. This can also be tied into the self-sacrifice aspect of cannibalcore described above where a person gives up parts of themself (in this case, physical parts such as blood and flesh) to show their devotion to their partner. Women in particular in our society may be expected to make sacrifices as well as do the majority of emotional labor in relationships. Additionally, because of the beauty standards women are expected to follow, the metaphor of the female body as something to be consumed or eaten is often used in cannibalcore media. On the other hand, this metaphor can also be flipped to illustrate the reclamation of women's autonomy. “Good for Her” revenge movies in which a woman takes (usually violent) vengeance on a man who has wronged her use the aesthetic of cannibalcore extremely often. A popular example of this is the film “Jennifer’s Body” in which a pretty, popular high school girl gains demonic powers after being attacked by a group of men. Used to being objectified by those around her, she now becomes the consumer instead of the one being consumed, seducing, killing and eating the men in her town to fuel her powers. In this way, the philosophy of cannibalcore can be used as a powerful representation of women choosing to redefine love, sex and relationships on their terms. By embracing their own desires, needs, and agency, women can use the metaphor to symbolize a radical act of self-love and self-determination, resisting the societal pressures that seek to consume them. Cannibalcore visuals usually revolve around flesh, blood and gore. However, gore is not a necessity in this aesthetic and does not need to be extreme to warrant fitting in the aesthetic. Key colors include shades of red and pink. Common visuals may include:",

Caricaturism can be both humoristic and Grotesque, with larger-than-life features that sometimes border on the absurd.[1] Commonly political figures like Donald Trump, and/or other political figures are usually depicted in comics[2] using this art form[3] Visual elements in caricatures distort reality, where not only people, but also animals, objects, landscapes, and essentially any element present in the artwork is prone to be exaggerated and distorted. Many modern artworks often make use of cartoon-esque elements, and occasionally grotesque features such as realistic textures and shading effects are also applied, especially when the character inspires disgust or is a villain itself. Caricaturism is a versatile art style that can be found in: Rage Comics are comics that us a a set of pre-made and/or drawn cartoon faces, Rage Faces, to express emotions or mundane activities. Rage comics are normally poorly created and drawn comics, often created with MS Paint, made to express different emotions. The most well known rage face is the Troll face, which expresses the action of \"trolling\". Rage comics were at their peak in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Wojak is a simple black-and-white MS Paint drawing of a bald man that originated in 2009.  The character has seen many variations over time, including the Doomer, Soyjak, and Coomer among others, which are often collectively called Wojak. Wojak are often used to make comics and parodies. Grotesque has come to be used as a general adjective for the strange, mysterious, magnificent, fantastic, hideous, ugly, incongruous, unpleasant, or disgusting. Originating in the 16th century, Caricaturism gained popularity during the Renaissance as artist like Leonardo da Vinci[4][5] explored exaggerated features in their artwork. However, it was in the 18th and 19th centuries that Caricaturism truly flourished. Renowned artists such as James Gillray and Thomas Nast used their humoristic and often satirical depictions to critique social and political issues.[3] Fast forward to the present day, Caricatures have found their way into the memes. In today's digital age, caricatures serve as a source of humor and commentary, often spreading on social media. Whether it's poking fun at public figures[2], or portraying a famous person, caricatures have become a popular form of visual expression.",

The aesthetic, geographically, focuses on Miami, Florida, USA, and Central & South America. It incorporates elements of 1980's fashion and imagery, with big inspirations for Cartelcore including Narcos, Scarface, Narcos Footage, Miami Vice, Hotline Miami, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories.

As a result of this; a lot of Drugcore can cross over into Cartelcore. It can also lead to some connections between Cartelcore and Vaporwave, although the drugs utilized as part of Vaporwave weren't particularly popular in the 1980s. Pastel colors and 1980's aesthetics are generally the core of Cartelcore fashion, especially paired with shades, gold jewelry (especially rings and chains). Hispanic themed fashions such as ponytails and slicked back hairdos with smart clothes, typically with silk shirts/trousers and silver heeled/tipped black boots with stirrups. As far as actual clothing items, polos and button up shirts undone about 2 buttons down from the top to display the collarbones and chains, as well as pastel colored shirts and pants. Bullet proof vests, blue jeans, and a black short sleeve button up shirt however, are the most accurate representations of this aesthetic. Basically any 1980's music can work for this, but Spanish music is preferred (IE: Narcocorridos).

This aesthetic is mostly centered around current cartoons on popular streaming services, such as Netflix and Hulu. Given the long, rich history of animation, there is a lot for Cartooncore enthusiasts to draw inspiration from: Cartooncore can either focus on a specific cartoon, animation, or movie or it can simply draw from the aesthetics of the style and create something completely new and unique to introduce into the world. Due to the fact that there is a lot more variety to western animation compared to the relative uniformity of anime, there is room for multiple sub genres of Cartooncore to pop up. Cartooncore also is closely related to Nostalgiacore because many people grew up watching cartoons over the past several decades. With cartoons comes a lot of merchandise. Merchandising for cartoons were especially popular during the 80s, such as toys for He-Man, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Transformers. Cartooncore people may wear shirts with logos and characters on them, and may have pins referencing a favorite show.  Other items might include: Cartooncore shows involve, you guessed it, cartoons, particularly the modern ones. Some popular shows in the Cartooncore aesthetic include: Cartooncore fans may listen to songs on YouTube that originate from cartoon-based video games, or just cartoon music in general. Some games emulate a cartoony aesthetic into their designs. Some examples of cartoony games include: Disneycore is an aesthetic based around all things Disney. Vintage Disneycore is based around old classic Disney films and shows, whether as Princess Disneycore is constructed around Disney Princesses (classic or modern). Fashion includes Disney merch, jeans, and Mickey/Minnie Mouse ears and/or backpacks. Disneycore fans enjoy music such as Disney movie scores, musical songs, and remixes of Disney music. UPA Revival is an aesthetic that revolves heavily around the style of cartoons produced by United Productions of America during the 50s-60s. These cartoons had a unique style incorporating Modernism and thick outlines, but the style became unpopular in the 1980s. The UPA revival started when the style began to be used again in 1990s-2000s cartoons such as Clone High. It was greatly helped by a multitude of separate trends that happened to be calling back to the same graphical style, such as the Mission School and Shoe Diva graphics of the 90s, the Groovival aimed at children that revived 60s and 70s visuals, and, by the time the early 2000s rolled around, by Superflat Pop.

It's nothing serious, just going out and having some clean, adult fun. Tourist Casino notes that, while it would be nice to strike it big, it's ultimately just about the fun and not getting overboard with gambling away all of your money. High Roller Casino fashion includes formalwear and can share a lot in common with the Lounge aesthetic. High Roller Casino individuals tend to hang around the table games (Poker, Roulette, Blackjack, etc) Tourist Casino fashion tends to be a bit more lax (simple t-shirts and what not) and shares a lot in common with Vacation Dadcore, with added fanny pack for fun effect. Tourist Casino individuals will tend to hang around the Slot machines and other games of that nature. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

The media itself does not have to be set in this time period, but rather explore the speculated alternate future of it. As the name suggests, cassettes are the main way of storing and transferring data. CRT monitors are often used, occasionally evolved into larger, more complicated machines, still with curved screens and chunky beige cases. These machines also often have large panels with lots of blinking lights and buttons and any graphics will be poor. Use of geometric shapes is common, and greebling is used mostly on places like lab walls or spaceships. Scenes may be monochromatic due to the overuse of grey/beige colours, sometimes with the glow of an led light, usually in red, green, or blue. If there are multiple colours, they are often analogous. There is a fantastic song that exemplifies this aesthetic well by I DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME called \"Leave Me Alone\". Within the music video of this song, it is set in a scientific setting where in the background old computers can be found, morphed into new technology implying them to be futuristic inventions.

Generally, Catholic Horror media often takes place in societies where traditional Catholic values are very prominent; for example, many movies are set in the past and in countries where Roman Catholicism is practiced (with France, Spain or Italy being the most common). Catholic Horror also incorporates local elements associated to predominantely Catholic cultures, such as Gothic architecture and cathedrals and other religious legends. Catholic Horror as a distinct horror genre began to emerge during the late 60s, with Rosemary's Baby (1968) becoming one of the first examples, and it played an important role in the Satanic Panic phenomenon as well as influencing the Morute aesthetic. Although the earliest example of Catholic Horror is Rosemary's Baby (1968), the first movie to fully embody the essence of this genre is considered to be The Exorcist (1973) by William Friedkin.[1] Said movie became really successful, and today it's still considered one of the best Horror movies ever made. This inspired many other movie producers to start making their own films blending Horror elements with Catholic elements. Another well known movie includes The Omen (1976) by Richard Donner. The Catholic Horror aesthetic & genre is heavily inspired by Catholicism's long history of exorcisms and belief in superstitions such as supernatural entities like demons. In the last decade this genre has made a comeback into the cinema, with several new movies or shows based around the genre being released.

The aesthetic also holds onto a degree of melancholy, tying back into its original creation for and by the neurodivergent community and the stigma/misunderstanding that often comes with it. Changelingcore was originally coined by (now-deactivated) Tumblr user willow-o-the-wisp as a subcategory of Fairycore that is exclusively for neurodivergent people (for example, people who are autistic, have ADHD, DID, etc.). It is often believed that changeling myths are derived from stories about neurodivergent, disabled, diseased and deformed children. Parents would see their children with one of these traits and believe that it wasn’t their own baby, but that a fairy swapped it out with their baby, causing its deformed appearance. Often times a changeling is considered to be a human and fairy hybrid. This Wikipedia section for Changelings goes more in depth about this. However, this aesthetic seeks to reclaim the term changeling as a source of pride, similar to how other communities have reclaimed terms that have been used against them. This is also why it is important that neurotypical people should not use the changelingcore aesthetic, as it could be considered appropriative and bordering on slur usage. Also keep in mind that this aesthetic was created for and by neurodivergent people, and that by no means are you obligated to subscribe to any aesthetic that you are uncomfortable identifying with.",

This subtype of Academia promotes the acceptance of messy or seemingly uncomposed traits some students may have. Chaotic Academia can be defined as: Chaotic Academia originated with the text post from Tumblr user chiafett-main saying, \"Chaotic academia is 1.) Intense obsessions that last maybe two weeks but consume your soul 2.) Spacing out in class but loving to learn 3.) Swearing and slang while discussing deep academic topics\".[1] This was posted on September 27, 2019, at the same time as the popularization of Dark Academia and the aesthetic variations being built off of this, such as with Light Academia. The idea is to accept and stop judging the less visually pleasing or perfectly performed tasks and processes. Unlike some other genres, it doesn't inherently agree to follow the rules and implies some visual or behavioral variety from the all-accepted idea of the prim and proper academics. Be yourself, have fun, and enjoy studying. For some, the floor is the best place to study, people can lack time management, scrawl poetry on a napkin, and not in a notebook, use vandalism for help on an exam, and have anarchism quotes all over notes. And it's fine! Chaotic academia books fall under 2 categories: banned literature, and books that weren't banned but are still chaotic (in a good way) in their own right. For instance, Ella Minnow Pea wasn't widely banned, but as the book goes along, the author stops using certain letters of the alphabet. Listed by book name in alphabetical order: Listed by book name in alphabetical order: The haphazard essence of this genre is primarily defined by self-explanatory actions, or so-called “inconsistent habits” that present the person as inattentive, lacking composure and overall imperfect. Below are a couple of such instances: Another kind, however, represents the playful sense of wonder and discovery in the academic setting. This way, one doesn't dissolve in the boring flow of new exams and assignments, brightening up the tedious study routine. Here are a few cases of chaotic behavior: The style doesn't have to be strictly formal and proper. The uniform should be fun!

The original members of Hoe Twitter's tweets were about sexual empowerment and acceptance.

After the death of one of the core members of the community - Taylor Crenshaw, known online as Milfie - Hoe Twitter transitioned into Cherry Emoji Twitter, since Milfie used the cherry emoji as her personal stamp/signature. Cherry Emoji Twitter was named after Milfie as a sign of respect, which redefined its aesthetic and started a new era for the community.[1] The visuals of Cherry Emoji Twitter are distinct and sexy, usually in the form of mood boards that are mostly pink in color, pictures of girls decked in sexy or pretty outfits while bloody, etc. They can overlap with Bubblegum Bitch visuals.

This art style is mainly present in flyers and street art related to Chicha music, which originated in the 1970s and it particularly has deep roots in Indigenous Peruvian & Andean cultures, also incorporating influence from Pop Art and Psychedelic art.  \nChicha art eventually grew beyond its musical roots and became one of the most influential art movements from Peru, sometimes being described as \"the Peruvian equivalent of Baroque\"[1]. Similiarly to the Hippie subculture, Chicha art has also been used to address political issues in south America, like Indigenous rights and gender inequality. Chicha as a musical genre and movement started developing in the decade of the 70s, but it wasn't until the 1980s when it officially became an art movement in its own right. The word \"Chicha\" is derived from the Spanish word chicha, which refers to a beverage originating from the Andes region in South America, reflecting the important Indigenous Peruvian influence on this movement. Chicha art emerged as a distinct trend during the rapid economical growth that Peru went through during the 1960s and 1970s. Lots of Peruvians (including Indigenous Andeans) migrated from rural areas to urban centers, particularly to Lima, and it quickly led to the growth of marginalized communities and the emergence of new Indigenous cultural expressions. Chicha music in particular became the chosen genre of this new cultural phenomenom, because it had pretty much everything needed for a countercultural movement; Chicha music is a mix of many Andean influences and it has a Psychedelic vibe to it.   \nAlongside Chicha music, an artistic counterpart developed in Peru. It was Chicha art; characterized by its bold colors, Psychedelic-inspired patterns, and imagery related to Andean cultures and social progress. Chicha art initially served as a promotional tool for Chicha music concerts, being principally found in street art, posters, flyers, and album covers. At first, it was seen from a racist point of view by many non-Indigenous Peruvians, who considered Chicha art part of huachafa culture (huachafa is a Peruvian Spanish term that refers to someone who pretends to be elegant, but is not, similiar to the German word kitsch). However, it soon became one of the most famous forms of art and cultural expression in Peru. Some visuals prominent in Chicha art include: Chicha music or Andean Tropical Cumbia originated in the 1970s in Peru. It blends elements of traditional Cumbia with many musical genres originating from Andean cultures, like Huayno, and also incorporates influence from Psychedelic Rock. The main instrument used in these songs is the electric guitar. Chicha music has a vast rich amount of influences in its musical patterns, including but not limited to Salsa, Mambo, Guaracha and Rock.",

The origin of the name is from Lana del Rey's song \"Cinnamon Girl,\" a melancholy song about being desperately in love to a man who pushes her away. Because of Lana del Rey's popularity with the female aesthetic community (as with all Coquette aesthetics), young women have taken the name and applied it to many brown-based visuals that have elements of other Girl aesthetics, which are aesthetics that are in line with an aspirational lifestyle for women in their late teens to late twenties. The other influence of the name is the emphasis on a \"signature scent,\" with cinnamon scents being highly connotative of coziness and autumn. One of the interpretations of the aesthetic is of a more youthful and trendy take on the Autumn VSCO aesthetic. Here, the aesthetic revolves around autumn-themed domesticity, especially baking, but with a more luxury, coquette, and Downtown Girl interpretation with updated fashion pieces and a more romantic image. Much of the inspiration also comes from Gilmore Girls, a TV show taking place in a charming autumnal New England town. The second interpretation is more in line with Clean Girl, where instead of the spring-themed pastels and spa-like pale colors, the colors are warm-toned. Similar to the other interpretation, there are more images of urban and luxury elements. The tag on TikTok most often brings up videos of young women lip-syncing to the song, with a caption that begins with \"Cinnamon Girl is for...\" with the rest of the caption describing types of sensitive, introverted, and hurt young women looking for love, as the original song describes. This, however, does not have an aesthetic component, as the videos lack a visual component other than the poster lip-syncing. There are many interpretations of this name, but one of the constants is the use of brown, beige, and other warm colors in photos, hence the name \"cinnamon.\" Foods that also have this spice, such as cinnamon rolls and lattes, are also common in all interpretations.

The Walt Disney Company, which acquired and repaired the New Amsterdam Theater after multiple efforts at redevelopment, was largely responsible for the alterations.

It began in the mid-1970s, rising to the peak of its popularity in the late-1970s and 1980s. It also spread to other areas of Asia, particularly establishing a foothold in Hong Kong, where many covers of popular City Pop songs were popularized in Cantopop. It is also considered a predecessor to modern J-Pop (though it certainly has more of a sophisticated vibe to it compared to modern J-Pop). Various City Pop songs are sampled in many Future Funk songs. Famous City Pop artists include, Mariya Takeuchi, Taeko Onuki, Miki Matsubara, Anri, Naoko Gushima, Tatsuro Yamashita, Junko Yagami, etc. Much of City Pop was also influenced by 80s Japanese New Wave artists, such as YMO, Akiko Yano, Ippu-Do, and Sandii and the Sunsetz. All of these artists worked with members of Japan, the British New Romantic band, who also experimented with and influenced City Pop. (A few other British artists in this genre include Virginia Astley and The Dolphin Brothers.) There are many City Pop compilations on YouTube for people to listen to, with channels such as Ganymede Cafe making 40 minute long compilations of City Pop songs. Many of these songs are played in the background of an old anime GIF on loop. City Pop is considered an aesthetic genre of music due to its casual and upbeat nature. Despite the best years of City Pop being behind the genre, the spirit of it lives on as sometimes it'll be interspersed with Vaporwave (and a lot of Vaporwave artists will sample City Pop in their songs to invoke the imagery of sophisticated Japan on the rise in the 80's and 90's) and a lot of City Pop aesthetics will find themselves tied to the Lo-Fi aesthetic, thus ensuring City Pop's legacy in internet aesthetic history. City pop has its origins in the Folk bands of the early 1970s. The folk rock band Happy End is often considered the foundation of City Pop.[1] A lot of City Pop images depict shots of opulent city life and high nightlife; hence the name. Many of these images are taken from tropical locations like California and Hawaii, featuring oceans, beaches, and palm trees.  These images are often stylistically edited to show more pops of magenta, cyan, red, yellow, blue, and Purple. Architecture is a common element depicted within the aesthetic, particularly pools and Modernist houses. City streets, skylines, and beaches are also prominently featured in city pop. Typically, these streets will be empty and peaceful with nobody around except a vintage vehicle (giving a similar vibe to the After Hours aesthetic). City Pop fashion tends to be very opulent, high end, and draws a lot on the Yuppie fashion of the time (and so a lot of J-Preppy and Resort style turns up in City Pop fashion).  Indeed, a lot of City Pop fashion has served as inspiration for a lot of modern Japan-inspired aesthetics such as Vaporwave and Lo-Fi. \"Business Casual\" is a popular phrase in City Pop fashion. Later City Pop music from the mid-to-late 1980s also draws a lot of inspiration in its female fashion from the then-emerging Bodikon subculture. Sailor Moon and California Crisis anime are prime examples of City Pop outfits. Typical City Pop fashion items include: *can be worn in neon or loud colours/patterns Wearing City Pop motifs (cities in neon colours, cassettes, soda or strawberry milk cans, occasionally flamingos, etc.) can also be considered a less casual and/or more modern subset of City Pop fashion. Hairstyles are reflective of the era, but simultaneously have a wide range. In women's hairstyles, common characteristics include voluminousness, curliness, and heavy application of products like hairspray and dry texturising spray. These include: Men's hairstyles are similar to women's hairstyles, being long and voluminous City Pop's musical style is heavily influenced by American soft rock (namely acts such as Steely Dan and The Doobie Brothers) by taking the song structures of the genre and mixing it with Southern R&B from the US, Northern Soul from the UK, and jazz fusion music to try and achieve an almost tropical and sophisticated sound (drawn heavily from the Hawaiian and Okinawan vibes in particular) born from the belief that the Japanese economy was only going to continue to thrive and grow and that the good times would never end (much like America's Roaring Twenties). The music in particular was also designed specifically to play in car stereos of the time (which were just starting to gain popularity), which was a very unique idea at the time. While City Pop faded out of style in Japan after the late 1980's, largely due to the tanking of the Japanese economy in what came to be known as \"The Lost Decade\" (that Japan arguably still hasn't completely recovered from), the genre went on to spread to the nearby Hong Kong as Cantopop artists made covers of Japanese City Pop songs until the 1990s. In the 2010's, City Pop has seemingly found new life thanks to edits of it being featured in Vaporwave and Future Funk. Future Funk artists in particular, such as MACROSS 82-99, tend to love to sample old City Pop songs and transforming them into funky new tracks. Classic City Pop also gained popularity around this time due to the fact the YouTube algorithm at one point decided to pick Mariya Takeuchi's \"Plastic Love\" to be the random video that turns up in everybody's feed to watch, which led to the song getting so popular that they decided to film a (new) music video for the song 35 years after its initial release! Many anime fans from the 90's (when anime was just starting to take off in the West) might actually recognize a lot of popular City Pop artists due to a lot of the artists doing the themes for various anime that came out in the 80's and early 90's and the themes themselves generally carry a slight City Pop sound. The spiritual successor of City Pop, Shibuya-kei, is a microgenre of pop music or a general aesthetic that flourished in the mid to late 1990s. Shibuya-kei initially fused French yé-yé, jazz, bossa nova, lounge music, funk, and 60's psychedelic pop into a futuristic retro-pastiche.

In Classic Lolita, higher heeled shoes with straps as well as Victorian style boots are favored instead. \nThe hair in Classic Lolita is kept natural in various shades of blonde, brown, and black. The hair can be styled in any way the person prefers. There are some who curl their hair, but it isn't very extreme. Makeup is preferred to be kept natural-looking as to appear mature.

It includes soaps, sponges, and bathtubs, as well as places that may seem to have been recently cleaned. It can be divided into two subaesthetics, each of which looks vastly different - High Cleancore deals with the adult world and products aimed at adults, such as washed-out soaps and sterile hotel rooms, while Low Cleancore deals with products aimed at children, such as bath toys and rubber ducks. As a continuation of many of its predecessors, Cleancore cynically embraces capitalist imagery, yet at the same time, taps into its anxiety-stricken audience, becoming a particularly popular aesthetic to try and achieve during the COVID-19 pandemic.

High Cleancore focuses heavily on actual hygiene and anti-bacteria aesthetics rather than the childhood nostalgic feel that Low Cleancore revolves around. The High Cleancore aesthetic gained popularity around the mid to late 2000s, and was most commonly used in commercials and marketing. This was also around the time that Frutiger Aero was gaining popularity, so they were often a pretty common pairing when it came to product design and marketing, which likely explains the similarities in visuals between the two aesthetics. High Cleancore has a very sterile, clean feel with a heavy focus on soap, water, deodorant, detergents, hand sanitizers, and various other forms of cleaners, and can overlap into the realm of Medicalcore with some of the aesthetics to create a cold, sterile image (which leads to Cleancore and Icepunk sharing similar colors). High Cleancore can also be compared to Helvetica Aqua Aero as they both share a very sterile feel, however, High Cleancore is separated from this aesthetic because it revolves around promoting cleanliness and hygiene rather than aquatic/oceanic imagery. High Cleancore fashion usually consists of the type of things worn while cleaning something or being in a clean environment. This includes surgical and gas masks, rubber gloves, safety goggles, hospital gowns, scrubs, and reflective vests. Due to High Cleancore’s heavy promotion on cleaning products, it’s quite obvious that a lot of product commercials would fall into this genre. Some of which include the following: Low Cleancore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecade of origin\nBased in 2000s/early 2010s\n\n\nKey motifs\nHygiene products aimed at children, bath toys, rubber ducks, bubbles, pajamas, robes, nostalgia\n\n\nKey colours\nPastels and/or vibrant colors\n\n\nRelated aesthetics\nBabycoreKidcoreKawaiiNostalgiacoreSanriocore\n\n\nRelated brands\nSanrio, Mr. Bubble, Colgate, Johnson’s, etc Low Cleancore, however is closer to Kidcore fashion, involving kiddie-themed bathrobes and pajamas. Low Cleancore aesthetics are designed to draw more of a similar vibe to a child's bath time, with not only the usual soaps and detergents often associated with Cleancore, but also things such as rubber duckies and other such bath toys, as well as safe substances that can turn the water all sorts of fun, vibrant colors that can make bath time all the more fun. Low Cleancore fashion is quite different apposed to High Cleancore fashion. Instead of all the cleaning gear High Cleancore involves, Low Cleancore usually consists of very much Kidcore clothing, and simulates much of what a child might wear during bath-time (Sanriocore can be an incredibly popular pairing with Low Cleancore fashion, in particular).

A nightclub is generally distinguished from regular bars, pubs or taverns by the inclusion of a stage for live music, one or more dance floor areas and a DJ booth, where a DJ plays recorded music. Dating back to the 19th century, clubs used to be places that offered live entertainment (including Vaudeville acts that were popular at the time), gambling, and was often used by prostitutes of the time to find clientelle (ranging from the playboys of the time to sailors on leave).  The Club format that we know today didn't become popular until the 1970s with the rise of the Disco clubs of the time (most famously Studio 54) that were safe havens for marginalized groups such as members of the LGBTQ and POC communities, the Jewish community, and even women (who considered these clubs to be safer than the discothèques of the time, which had an every-woman-for-every-three-men law they abided by) would favor coming here to just go out and have fun without having to worry about men trying to hit on and harass them. The visuals of the Club aesthetic can share a LOT in common with the Raver and Glowwave aesthetic with the bright lights, glowing objects, drinks, and party drugs.  While one might confuse a Raver and Club aesthetics on first glance, the Club aesthetic may have more of an high-end vibe to it, compared to the generally more free-spirited Raver aesthetic. Club fashion tends to be very high-end and is supposed to look nice, yet casual and is generally very breezy and light (due to the fact clubs are known to get incredibly hot).  However, that isn't to say some rather avant-garde fashion can't come out of club fashion (just ask the Club Kids), but generally, if the bouncer doesn't approve of your fashion, you ain't wearing proper club fashion. Clubs typically play dance music, which is composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing, which clubs were build for. It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music.  While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances.  The music side of the aesthetic includes: Hardcore, electronica, industrial, breakbeat, trance, psychedelic trance, UK garage and electro. There are also much slower styles, such as downtempo, chillout and nu jazz",

Several Club Kids have made long-lasting contributions to mainstream art and fashion, even in the present day. In many ways, the vast majority of the aesthetics on the Aesthetics Wiki owe their very existence to the Club Kids of the 1980s. A movie about the Club Kids was made through World of Wonder Productions (the same production company behind the world-famous RuPaul's Drag Race) called Party Monster starring Seth Green as James St. James and Macaulay Culkin as Michael Alig based on the novel James St. James wrote entitled Disco Bloodbath (which was renamed to Party Monster after the success of the movie). While it fell dormant for a while after Rudy Giuliani started cracking down on the rampant drug use in New York City some time in the mid-1990's thanks to his \"Quality of Life\" crackdowns, the Club Kid aesthetic has started to see a resurgence with a brand new generation, although the Nu-Club Kids definitely seem to have a more introverted nature to them compared to the rowdy and raucous Club Kids of old. The early, early origins of the Club Kids movement date back to 1984, when Saginaw, Michigan native James Clark (who would later become James St. James) moved to New York City to study performance art at New York University after being inspired by the novel Popism: The Warhol Sixties by the late, great Andy Warhol in hopes of becoming the next Warhol Superstar. Instead, he got absorbed into the New York club scene after becoming good friends with columnist and nightlife icon Michael Musto, which allowed James to live something of a celebutante lifestyle. Meanwhile, Michael Alig moved to the city from his hometown of South Bend, Indiana and began to hone his promotional skills by promoting small events in the Big Apple In the late 1980's is when things come to fruition. Despite initially being rejected by the others at first, Michael Alig was undeterred and started up his own scene with his own unique cast of characters. His promotional skills and flamboyant personality did eventually win James St. James over and the Club Kids were officially born. In 1987, Michael Alig officially supplanted the late Andy Warhol as the premier partier of New York City (due to his recent passing). On March 17th, 1996, Michael Alig and fellow Club Kid Freeze (real name Robert Riggs) killed their drug dealer Angel (real name Andre Melendez) by Freeze hitting him in the head with a hammer three times, followed by Alig smothering the drug dealer and pouring Draino into his mouth before duct taping it shut. After 5-7 days, they went and bought 2 chef knives and a cleaver at a Macy's before getting to work dismembering the corpse, sticking the remains into garbage bags and duffel bags before dumping said remains into the Hudson River, where it was ultimately discovered. Unfortunately for them, they did get caught and arrested where, on October 1st, 1997, Freeze and Michael Alig were sentenced to 10-20 years in prison for manslaughter. Freeze was let out on parole in 2010 while Alig remained in prison until May 5th, 2014 and has since gotten involved in the YouTube space. Despite the abrupt ending to the Club Kids scene, it continued to bubble under the surface of Drag Culture until the mainstream explosion of popularity in drag culture thanks to RuPaul's Drag Race (hosted by RuPaul, himself a former Club Kid) and now has seen something of a renaissance in the LGBTQ culture of the modern era, although now the Club Kid aesthetic is no longer restricted to the clubs and seems to have found a new home on Instagram (which you can find a collection of under #clubkid), where the new, more introverted Club Kids are able to express themselves in a more intimate setting and with a bigger audience. If one wishes to learn more about this particular subject, it's highly recommended to read James St. James' book \"Party Monster\" (originally titled Disco Bloodbath) or watch the World of Wonder film of the same name starring Seth Green as James St. James and Macaulay Culkin as Michael Alig. Alig died of a drug overdose on Christmas of 2020. All Club Kid fashion is, incredibly, Avant-garde and Androgynous by design, looking to push the boundaries of fashion and art, having a very Punk/DIY vibe to them since these over-the-top designs were often hand-made by the Club Kids themselves A lot of Club Kid music was heavily inspired by the Studio 54-era Disco music and the burgeoning electronic music sound that was just starting to penetrate into mainstream musical culture during the rise of the Club Kids.

The term cluttercore itself was reportedly coined by TikTok user @mDugy and gained momentum as more and more people resonated with a design philosophy supporting, “an appreciation of things that we can call our own”. While some media outlets frame the aesthetic as a Gen-Z \"revolt\" against Millennial's minimalism, many Millennials have embraced the aesthetic and helped popularize it. At the core, the aesthetic is about curating items in a way that puts individuality and self-expression on display. It has similarities to goblincore in the sense that it includes collections of items or trinkets that may not have meaning to anyone or be attractive other than the collector themselves. While previous types of maximalism were about showing off wealth, cluttercore is more about showing off the things that you love and putting your own personal touch on it. Some people would say that cluttercore is not something that is taught so much as it is a way of being, and some who have embraced the style say that discovering the term felt validating of something that they were already doing or liberating from the shame of being unable to maintain a minimalist aesthetic. Critics of cluttercore and maximalism argue that it can get out of control to become less like self-expression and more like hoarding, which is a mental health defined by \"getting/keeping too many items that you may not have a need for right now and don't have space for\". While the claims of mental health impacts are extreme realities, and the aesthetic is not inherently \"dirty\" or trashy it can still be understandingly overwhelming or stressful for people who are in the space. Excessive clutter is also known to negatively impact people's emotional, social, and physical well-being. @mDugy, who coined the term, is quick to note that “cluttercore is in no way a promotion of unhealthy hoarding of material objects and garbage” but it's important to know yourself and have a method in place to maintain it as an aesthetic, instead of simply having too much stuff. One way to help determine whether or not the clutter is a problem is if getting rid of things is creating problems in other areas of your life, such as being unable to find important items like bills, hurting yourself bumping/tripping over things, or finding yourself overwhelmed or depressed as a result of clutter. This highly personalized aesthetic is characterized by what specifically makes the creator happy and showcases their individual personality. One or many other types of aesthetics can be weaved into one space, the important thing is that walls and surfaces are covered with curated objects which are meaningful to whoever arranged them. These can include items such as: Items can be grouped together either by specific collections, loosely related, or completely unrelated outside of what the creator finds attractive and self-expressive.",

It creates an atmosphere that expresses the femininity and youth associated with young women vacationing during the summertime. The aesthetic has multiple interpretations; while in the beginning, it was known among the Nymphet community, it later gained more mainstream appeal and was connected to other beach-related aesthetics such as VSCO and surf culture[1]. Because of this, visuals may differ and is connected to the practice of mass-tagging. The aesthetic stems from early 2000s girly summer tourist culture and is influenced from pictures on Pinterest illustrating those times. It then began to grow popular on TikTok by young women who have developed a fascination with the unreleased songs of Lizzie Grant (Lana Del Rey), specifically the songs \"Mermaid Motel,\" \"St. Tropez,\" and \"Wayamaya.\" The last song is largely the most frequently played in Coconut Girl TikToks, and its imagery largely codified the aesthetic; ukelele, Lana's girlish and dreamy tone, and lyrics centering around vacationing in the upper-class areas of Hawaii are traits that can be easily translated into visuals. Like other aesthetic TikToks, these content creators play the songs while rapidly showing images of Coconut Girl aesthetics. The ideology around the Coconut Girl aesthetic comes from the followers of the aesthetic, who are mostly young women in their teens and twenties. Feminine sensuality and youth is strongly associated with the aesthetic. However, anyone of any age or gender can participate in Coconut Girl. The most important part of the aesthetic is the mindset of relaxation and fun. Much of the imagery associated with this originated from the Surf Crush trend of the early 2000s, combined with the brightly colored and plastic Tween culture of the time period. And due to the influence of Lana Del Rey/Lizzie Grant, Vintage Americana motifs are common. Popular places that can be associated with the Coconut Girl aesthetic include: Popular Coconut Girl fashion opts for fashion from and inspired by clothing and brands that were popular in the early 2000s among the Teens and Tweens of the time.  Some of these brands can include: Roxy, Billabong, Delia*s, and Claire's. A very common fashion figure associated with the Coconut Girl aesthetic is the early 2000's version of Rihanna with her eclectic blend of the sort of pop music that was popular at the time with the stylings of her native Caribbean islands (Barbados, to be exact). Tropicalcore is an internet aesthetic that could be interpreted as a more Kawaii take on Coconut Girl, often featuring tropical beaches, the ocean and sea, mixed with cute filters and effects like glitter, saturated colours, clutter and bright flowers. Tropicalcore images often feature fictional characters from anime, video games, and also Sanrio characters like Hello Kitty. Commonly these people wear colorful swimsuits, accompanied by flowers, tropical fruits, a drink or lollipops. Although many Tropicalcore edits may feature fictional characters and the editing techniques might resemble Cutecore, there are other images that only display imagery relating to the beach, the sea, and/or food and beverages with flowers in the image. Tropicalcore fashion is inspired by what a tweenager would typically be wearing at the beach, with some elements inspired by the Gyaru subculture. It consists of hibiscus flowers, see-through swimsuit coverups, floral accessories, sandals, anklets, friendship bracelets, crocs and beach-themed Jibbitz to go with it, dolphin accessories, mermaid accessories, earrings, goggles, colorful bikinis, and swimsuits.

There is a sense of nostalgia and a reverence for the past and for Americana and older pop culture as well as an active rejection of more modern views typical of the Millennials and Generation Z. However, that nostalgic reverence is also melancholic and is often paired with sentiments of paranoia and fear as well as the feeling that the world has gone insane and society is on the brink, with the only hope being to preserve and revere the past and to \"clock out\" of the mainstream society and live in the countryside. In a private chat on Discord, Roy The Drifter revealed that he was a transgender man in his late 20's who created the aesthetic as an expression of his feelings that he did not fit in with either mainstream society or the subcultures of his own generation and his active dislike of mainstream culture and mentality of his generation. He wanted to combine his love of old Americana with his love of horror fiction, Halloween, the occult, anime, and the supernatural with his rural upbringing in a dark aesthetic to express his feelings.",

        "title": "Colour Theory",
        "description": "Color theory is not an aesthetic. This page is a tool to provide terminology and guidance related the use of color in aesthetics. The color theory is a concept to help guide one in the use of color and has terminology that helps the person understand how colors work together. There are three parts of color: saturation (how bright the color is, or how much pigment is used), value (how dark or light the color is, colloquially referred to as shade), and hue (the color or wavelength of light you are seeing).[1] As the color wheel focuses on hue that is what will be the next subject. The color wheel is a popular, abstract, illustrative organization of color hues in the shape of a circle, used to demonstrate the relationships between primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, and sometimes more (including further combinations of color or gradients). A set of primary colors are a set of colors that can be combined to produce a gamut of color. The color wheel typically has three primary colors, based on either the RGB (red, green, and blue) color model or the RYB (red, yellow, and blue) color model. The RYB model is used mostly in non-digital art and applied design, and the RGB model is used mostly for color display in electronic systems. Because both online and offline visuals are relevant to aesthetics, information about both models of color will be included here. Secondary colors are colors created through the combination of two primary colors. In the RYB color model, these are orange, green, and purple. In the RGB model, they are yellow, magenta, and cyan. Tertiary colors are color created through the combination of a primary color and a secondary color, or a combination of two secondary colors. According to the RYB color model, these are vermilion, amber, chartreuse, teal, violet, and magenta. In the RGB model, they are azure, violet, rose, orange, chartreuse, and spring green. The precise division between warm and cool colors is disputed. However, red, orange, yellow are most commonly considered warm, while green, blue, and violet are cool. See Color symbolism for descriptions of meanings associated with warm and cool colors. Direct complementary colors are colors positioned opposite each other on the color wheel, or 180 degrees, which create neutral colors when mixed. On the RYB colour wheel, they are red-green, blue-orange, and yellow-purple. On the RGB color wheel, they are red-cyan, blue-yellow, and green-magenta. These colours contrast with each other, which, at full saturation, like in Slimepunk, can cause eye strain. When placed against each other, complementary colors often look discordant. Split complementary colors are sets of three colors including one color and two colors adjacent to that color’s direct complement, which are 150 degrees from the original color. Like complementary colors, they contrast with each other significantly. This creates a sense of unity and energy (but is more complicated than either complementary or analogous). Mythpunk uses one of these. Triads are sets of three colours at equal distance from each other on the colour wheel, which are 120 degrees from the original color. These are usually red, blue, and yellow or green, orange, and purple like on Halloween. The Art Hoe aesthetic uses a mainly triad based colour scheme. Tetrads are sets of four colors at equal distance from each other from the color wheel, all of which are 90 degrees from each other. An example would be red, cyan, chartreuse, and violet. Near-analogous colors are sets of colors positioned almost directly close to the original color of choice, which are 60 degrees away from each other. An example would be red, yellow, and magenta. Analogous colours are sets of colors positioned beside each other on the colour wheel, i.e. red, red-orange, and orange. These colors are harmonious, creating a sense of unity. However, it can also seem more artificial if done improperly or have no focal point in an image. Examples of aesthetics that frequently use analogous colour palettes include Light Academia, Red, or Traumacore, or Yami Kawaii. Saturation describes proximity of a color to gray and its relative intensity and brilliance. As saturation increases, intensity and brilliance increase; as saturation decreases, proximity to gray increases. This can make something appear light or dark, but it doesn't mean it is (for that, see value). Saturation can be effective for drawing attention to a focal point, but if an image is highly saturated all over, it can cause visual illusions, headaches, and a sense of chaos in the viewer. Desaturated (low saturation) colours are easier to unify but they are also less of a focal point and are more likely to seem tired or old. Fluorescent colors, also known as neon colors, can cause a sense of chaos, disquiet, discomfort, and, in some cases, visual illusions and eye strain. Aesthetics that use this are Psychedelica. Neon colors are often used separately from one another in aesthetics, such as separating Scene from Emo. Neon colors are used in Cyberpunk and Vaporwave to prevent too much discomfort, but also to imitate neon lighting and other artificial light sources. Bright colours are colours with high saturation of any hue. These often seem childish and can be hard to style together. However, they are also bold and create a statement either independently or in a group. These are often associated with the '70s, '80s, and early 90s' - 2000s fashion. Nostalgiacore, Art Hoe, and Wormcore all use bright colors. Earth tones are low-saturation colours of any value that can be found frequently in nature. These colours commonly include browns, yellows, greys, greens, and blues. They can symbolize life and nature generally, as in Naturecore, adventuring, as in Adventurecore, and nature as in Art Nouveau. Value describes the amount of white or black in a color and its relative lightness or darkness. A hue to which white has been added is a tint, and a hue to which black has been added is a shade. Darker values are usually considered more serious, though not necessarily masculine. The femme fatale aesthetic often uses shades, though it is also highly feminine. However, tints are often associated with purity (just as white is) and femininity. Muted tones: Muted tones are desaturated colours with a low value. Muted tones give the appearance of age and officiality, as in Dark Academia or Dolly Kei and to fit a certain era's photos aesthetic such as in Cryptidcore. They can also seem dull and lifeless such as in Ocean Grunge. Pastels: Pastel colors, or pastels, are colors with high value and low saturation. Pastels colors include baby blue, pink, mint, lavender, and lilac. They’re sometimes used in bright aesthetics derived from dark aesthetics, as in Bubble Goth, Pastel Goth, and Pastel Punk. They are also used to symbolize femininity, as in Lolita and Mori Kei, sweetness and happiness, in Cottagecore and Light Academia, or innocence and purity, as in Angelcore and Fairycore. Grayscale: Grayscale color schemes are sets of colors between white and black. Monochromatic: Monochromatic color schemes are sets of colors with the same hue but varying values. High contrast: While most colour palettes with contrasting colors rely on those colors having the same value. A high contrast palette is a limited colour scheme that relies on the contrast of black, dark greys and white to achieve its effect. Many goth aesthetics and Vampire use high contrast palettes. Jewel tones: Jewel tones were originally based off of crystals and precious stones. These are predominantly dark to medium shades of purple, cyan, emerald green, yellow, or red. Jewel tones are often popular during autumn (in America and the West) so it's no surprise it's in Autumn. Metallic colours: Metallic colours are inspired by metals. These are silver, like in Y2K Futurism, gold, like in Wabi-Sabi, bronze, chrome, steel, or copper. Other aesthetics that use metallic colors are Crowcore and Cyberprep. Holosexual arguably uses some metallic colors, too. Cool colours: Cool colours are either cool-toned colours (like Crimson red, ultramarine blue,) and therefore make a different feeling colour wheel than warm-toned, and will make better purples and blacks when painting - or they are colours associated with winter or water. Two examples are Seapunk and Icepunk. Warm colours: Warm colours are either colours that are warm toned (in this case Cadmium red, Cerulean blue, and Cadmium yellow) and will make better oranges, or are colours associated with warmth, summer, or food.  Warmcore, Tropical, and Golden Hour are all examples of aesthetics with warm colours. Of course, this begs the question, \"Does an aesthetic need a colour scheme or palette?\" The short answer is not always. Neither Cleancore nor Goblincore have one listed at this time (04/08/2020). A colour scheme is a great unifying tool but it sometimes becomes too restrictive. However, it does allow a lot more people to see and identify your aesthetic visually. A colour palette or scheme can also serve a vital function of defining your aesthetic and its message from another aesthetic, as well as creating nuanced meaning to your aesthetic, such as in things such as Vaporwave. How do I create a colour palette? This article will now take you through three methods of choosing your colour palette using an example: Mythpunk. Decide what your colour scheme needs to do: is it separating your punk from another aesthetic like Seapunk? Is it just something to make everything cohesive? Or is it adding onto a meaning or symbolism, or changing the meaning? Pastels with children’s toys would enforce the meaning, but deep blue would change the image. Colours can change the meaning or look of something very quickly. If you want to use the colour scheme to create a difference between your aesthetic and another one, see what the first aesthetics colour scheme is, then go for the opposite. Look through this list, see the aesthetics you’re inspired by and go off of them. See what you would like to keep or throw away. Photo picking means taking one or more images and taking the eyedropper tool, and seeing what colours are contained in them. You take bits from all the pictures, not just the focal point. The example to the right, there's a lot of low-value colours, quite a few dark browns, but definite pops of gold, blue, aqua, and red-orange. You can also just eyeball it, but using the eyedropper tool will give you the most unbiased results. I did this for my Mythpunk and got several options: as you can see to the left. Blues, aqua, black, brown, red, orange, etc. Creating a new colour scheme: with this, you need to take the fundamental principals from the colour wheel, Saturation, and Value. Take those concepts and use them to either polish up your colour palette or to find your ideal colours. Try to have fun with it.",

Depending on the workplace, various levels of the formality of business attire are expected, and the norm. The dress codes range from traditional and formal to smart casual, business casual, and casual. A lot of modern Corporate visuals will draw loosely from the Cyberprep aesthetic (unless you're the CEO, where Boujee is almost undoubtedly the aesthetic of choice for you) in the sense it's very safe, sterile, and designed solely to motivate you to continue being a useful part of the corporate infrastructure, which can be similar to the Studyblr aesthetic, since it's believed by many that an aesthetically-pleasing workspace increases productivity. The Corporate aesthetic often avoids exaggerated outfits and bright colors, resorting to more monotonous and grey-tone colors that add to the sleekness and sterility of office buildings. A lot of retro corporate aesthetics are often incorporated into the Vaporwave aesthetics, albeit ironically. Unless it's a Business Casual (see below), most Corporate fashion will feature the following for men: For women, however, there can be a little more variety: Some ways to tell the degree of formality of an attire is to take notice on the features[1]. Business Professional is the most traditional attire, with strict dress code policy. This attire is required in conservative companies and in government work-related settings. Careers such as law, accounting, and finance commonly are required to wear Business Professional. Business Formal is similar to business professional, but this attire is commonly used for special events, dinner and award ceremonies. Colored suits and dresses are allowed, while still maintaining professionalism. Silk ties and pocket squares for men is a requirement. Long evening dresses for women may be appropriate. Business Casual is an ambiguously-defined Western dress code that is generally considered casual wear but with smart components of a proper lounge suit from traditional informal wear, adopted for white-collar workplaces. The fashion of this subgenre involves: Smart Casual, also referred to as \"Chic Modernist\", is a more stylish version of Business Casual. The wardrobe is not super dressy but still looking nice and presentable. This is suitable for client meetings and job interviews. For more information on this particular aesthetic, please check out the Chic Modernist page. Members of the Goth subculture that are part of the Corporate machine will incorporate the Corporate Goth aesthetic (examples of Corporate Goth) into their work attire. Corporate Punk is an insult that comments on corporate businesses attempting to cash in on the punk movement, but either horribly failing or only being able to appeal to those who don't understand punk. Usually corporations scouting out members to fit a theme rather than the band coming together naturally.For more information on this particular aesthetic, please check out the Corporate Punk page. Many people nowadays use Corporate attire for aesthetic purposes. It is now used for day-to-day streetwear by some people who have a preference for professionalism and maturity. Since people in general usually own formal wardrobe, this aesthetic is inclusive for everyone and therefore it has no certain community or specific names for this kind of streetwear. This attire also serves for an entertainment purpose, such as cosplaying. From the western movie Reservoir Dogs (1992) to Japanese manga Chainsaw Man (since 2018), people are no longer limited to using Corporate wear for work. There are several character tropes who use business attire in media: A lot of corporate music is easy-listening, kinda jazzy, and instrumental.  A lot of Corporate-sounding music has been sampled to make a lot of Vaporwave music which, ironically, can also be part of the Corporate musical sound once more.

The Hippie and psychedelic movements began in the Mid-1960s (c, 1964-1967), promoting values such as anti-war, peace & love, recreational drug use, and rising to popularity largely in the psychedelic music scene. The Hippie movement reached new heights with the beginning of the Summer of Love; the Summer of Love was a social phenomenon that occurred during the summer of 1967, when as many as 100,000 people, mostly young people sporting Hippie fashions of dress and behavior, converged in San Francisco's neighborhood of Haight-Ashbury. The Beatnik movement is widely accepted as the predecessor to the Hippie subculture. By 1968, Hippie-influenced fashion and music had begun to become widely recognised in the mainstream. This saw corporations attempting to appeal to the broader public by using visuals associated with Psychedelica, spawning Corporate Hippie. These attempts at appealing to the youth was in direct conflict with the Hippie subculture's distain towards the \"establishment\", Corporate Hippie being largely consumed by normal people who adopted Hippie style and fashion but had little connection with the subculture as a whole. By 1970, the zeitgeist of the 1960s and Hippie movement had begun to see decline, especially in the United States. This was largely due to the fact that the Hippie movement was no longer an underground subculture and had become mainstream, prominent motifs such as long hair or psychedelic rock music being adopted by general public; this diminished the exclusiveness the Hippie subculture embodied. Events such as Tate–LaBianca murders committed by Charles Manson and his cult in August 1969 also tarnished the reputation of the Hippie subculture in the eyes of some Americans, further contributing to its decline. By 1975, Corporate Hippie and the Hippie subculture as a whole largely fell out of mainstream popularity. Corporate Hippie's visuals can be described as a more watered-down, mainstream version of Psychedelica, both containing the same core visuals. Corporate Hippie, however, is less abstract and more consumer-friendly. Common visual motifs include: The people depicted in Corporate Hippie advertisements usually sport fashion and clothing reminiscent of Hippie fashion.",

Taking Flat Design and blending it with shades of Corporate and the original Memphis Design, this art style aims to create visuals that are easy to mass produce and utilize for commercial purposes. Corporate Memphis originated in 2017, when an illustrative style called \"Alegria\" was developed by media agency Buck for Facebook. Today, imitations of the style are widely seen in various websites, advertisements, logos, and even computer interfaces. As a result, there has been a growing awareness for this minimalist look, with internet users complaining about the monotony and oversaturation of the style. Corporate Memphis heavily utilizes basic Color Theory; the main four colors generally tend to be red, blue, green and yellow (sometimes pink or purple is used as well). They often avoid dynamic shading, aiming for a flat and sleek look. Corporate Memphis is most commonly known for its vector illustrations. Common body proportions tend to be small heads with big torsos and/or long, bending legs. Facial features vary, with some designs having none, to having only a mouth, or to also have eyes and noses. One thing Corporate Memphis can be given credit for is the diversity; with people of various races and ethnicity being represented positively. One popular video that discusses Corporate Memphis is Solar Sands, a YouTuber who mainly talks about art phenomenons. In it, he goes into depth on why people may be jaded from the style, and explains the possible origins.

It is centered on ideas of simple living and harmony with nature. Other themes associated with cottagecore include self-sufficiency, the romanticization of domestic labor, and caring for people. While the aesthetic is prevalent on several social media sites, such as on Instagram and more recently TikTok, the community originated on Tumblr. However, this is an internet and visual-centered look on prior decorative, literary, and historical trends. It is particularly popular within woman-loving-woman (WLW) and nonbinary loving women (NBLW) communities (although sexuality does not define the aesthetic). The aesthetic is a continuation of many other nature-based aesthetics, but draws the most influence from the romanticization of the English countryside from the Romantic and Victorian periods. Its visuals are based on the domestic lifestyle associated with living in this type of environment, with all images providing a sense of comfort and mild adventure. Despite a number of its followers taking a progressive and subversive outlook, Cottagecore has been also criticized for its romanticism of eurocentric farming life. It has also been criticized in the context of North American and Australian settings, an inadvertent celebration of the aesthetics of colonialism, as well as the ways it often simplifies and underestimates the labor of farmers. It is due to these connotations that the use of Cottagecore aesthetics has been adopted by the TradWife community and members of the far-right as forms of propaganda. This has led to media criticism despite their opposition to LGBTQ+ and anti-capitalist adherents of Cottagecore. Cottagecore is often compared to aesthetics such as Grandparentcore, which seek to evoke a similar sense of nostalgia. It is also related to Naturecore and Warmcore. Cottagecore is a continuation of ideas that have existed for millenia and uses visuals that are based in the aesthetic of the European countrysides. The evolution of these ideas into contemporary Cottagecore, an aesthetic borne out of the internet and among teenagers to young adults, is the primary history of this section, but also describes the history of Cottagecore's precursors as well. One of the largest influences is the artistic movement of Romanticism, which emphasized a connection to nature, the past, and the senses, rather than logic.[1] It also encouraged a sense of national pride, which led to British landscape artists in particular to paint scenes of rural small towns, often with the same thatched cottages admired today. Similarly, this artistic movement was a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, much like how Cottagecore now is against the increasingly capitalistic and industrialized economy. The next artistic movement that revived this love for British cottages is the Arts and Crafts movement, which focused on decorative arts such as furniture, ceramics, illustration, etc. Floral patterning was extremely popular, as well as a lighter and softer interpretation of what art is supposed to be. Also around this time, Beatrix Potter released her Peter Rabbit children's books, which is one of the first introductions people had to the Victorian garden aesthetic, with the soft watercolors and sense of innocence. Other influential children's literature published in the 19th century include Heidi, The Secret Garden, and Anne of Green Gables. These books had a common appreciation for femininity and nature, and with lush descriptions of food and activities being prominenetly featured throughout. Despite their age, these works are incredibly popular with the children oftoday, and this nostalgia continues to inspire people who read these novels in their childhood. An additional genre that \"created\" Cottagecore was also fantasy, especially with J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series and various fairytales, especially that of the fae in Britain and Ireland. These books lend a sense of adventure and folkloric superstition to the aesthetic, and it is not uncommon for appreciators to do a few rituals typically associated with fairies for the sake of them. Throughout the development of film, animation, TV, etc., many works had their settings in small European villages and forests. Visually, much of Cottagecore takes inspiration from the 1970s, which had a fashion and home decor aesthetic known as Romantic Revival and Shabby Chic, led mostly by the companies Gunne Sax and Laura Ashley. Cottagecore fashion is largely a continuation of the designs that they used: prairie dresses in floral calico print, with heirloom sewing details, antique furniture, and soft pastels. The interior design details of Shabby Chic have similar grandmotherly connotations. The Japanese alternative fashion Mori Kei also had an extremely large influence on the aesthetic, especially since the fashion was popular on tumblr in the early to mid-2010s. This was the de-facto feminine, nature-based, and cozy aesthetic. However, like many other trends, Mori Kei dwindled out. But as Cottagecore gained in popularity, there was a spike in Google trend searches for the fashion, showing a clear lineage in the fashion.[2] In 2019 tumblr[3], the animated show Moomin Valley became a meme and frequent topic of conversation on the website. It popularized Cottagecore, as the characters lived in this sort of environment, with scenes of foraging, frolicking, and adventuring. Tumblr users wished for this sort of lifestyle, and the television show became a common gateway to the aesthetic. Studio Ghibli animated films have also been quite prevalent on the site, and users would have noted the commonalities between these two franchises and explored similar photographs and activities. During this same time, there was the trend of \"yearning\" on tumblr. Users would post about wishing for romantic partners and situations to happen, focusing on \"tenderness\" such as holding hands and sharing fruit. This was especially popular among the queer community, which is constantly in the process of redefining and creating images of love outside of the heteronormative imagery and traditions of the past. The 2020 coronavirus pandemic also led to the rise of Cottagecore as activities such as baking bread[4], playing Animal Crossing[5], gardening, sewing, and other handicrafts[6] rose in popularity. Coupled with a rise of the app TikTok, people were more exposed to crafting and these activities became trends. The virality of Little Women (2019) was another contributing factor to the popularity amongst teenaged girls. Another quarantine trend in 2020 was Lirika Matoshi's \"Strawberry Dress,\" a pink tulle gown with sequined strawberries and a milkmaid style. As Vogue describes it, the appeal of the dress is \"...that sweet strawberry print is deeply nostalgic, hearkening back to a time long before COVID-19, to a childhood innocence that feels especially soothing right now.\" Like Moomin Valley, the dress was incredibly meme-ified, with it appearing in non-Cottagecore contexts, such as in fan-art.[7] Its popularity led to people, especially on TikTok, to discover the aesthetic. Throughout 2020, Cottagecore was made aware to various audiences as publications such as Vox and The New York Times reported on the trend. It later filtered down to various magazines and other interest sites, making the aesthetic's name fairly well-known among fashion, interior design, and crafting enthusiasts. The aesthetic became even more well-known with the release of Taylor Swift's July 2020 album Folklore, as the singer's visual and musical styles would influence many of her fans' tastes.[8] Cottagecore has a naturalistic color palette with light green foliage, browns of natural stones and wood, straw, and flowers. Pastels are common in painting. Lighting is always natural, with sunlight being the de facto light source. Morning to late afternoon \"golden hour\" is the range of lighting. Different motifs appear throughout Cottagecore in various ways; rather than limiting a photo subject to just pictures of its natural form, some items appear in various mediums, such as in illustration, printed fabric, novelty dishware, and other manners of home decor. The most common motifs are: strawberries, mushrooms, and flowers. Nature is one the main visuals of the aesthetic. One of the most common photographic subjects is wild fields of grass with small wildflowers dotted throughout. Deciduous forest is also common, always in green during spring and summer, with autumnal colors and wintertime being rare. However, unlike more wild aesthetics such as Naturecore, there are almost always signs of human involvement in the rural space. Fences, bridges, clothes lines, picnicking, and controlled amounts of forestation are more often than not, elements of these images. In Cottagecore, humans have to have presence in the natural environment, shaping the landscape into home. Gardens are of course a manifestation of this interaction between nature and human intervention. These gardens are always done in the English style, meaning that the land is cultivated to look more wild and with great variety, rather than geometric and controlled.[9] Ponds are often included, as well as wheelbarrows, wooden benches, gazebos, and other garden paraphernalia. Often, large and ornate glass greenhouses are featured, which are more in line with a wealthy, English nobility aesthetic as opposed to modest and attainable rural life. More mundane and achievable gardens can be featured, and they largely focus on the crops grown there, such as frills of lettuce sprouting from the ground or strawberries in a white-washed planter box. The other main visual, and the one that gives Cottagecore its namesake is the cottage, which is a fairly loose term that includes multiple types of homes. The most common Cottagecore house is the archetypical English thatch-roofed cottage with painted white or rusticated stone walls, chimneys, and shrubbery in the front. The second-most common is a miniature house or shed constructed from wood, with a gabled roof. Novel and twee decorations and painting is common in these miniature houses, and they are typically painted in pastel, feature decorative carvings, and windowboxes filed with plants. English manors are also heavily featured in Cottagecore, and fit many aesthetics, such as Tudor, Cottage Orne, and even Neoclassical, among others. These mansions are typically more extravagent than what Cottagecore is claimed to be, which will be expanded upon in the Controversy section. Architecture that is incredibly fanciful and fairy-tale-esque is also common. They often look to be falling apart, sloping, or impossibly precarious. This fits into the fairy and witch influences. Images of the interiors of these cottages are also common and the way how Cottagecore enthusiasts can express their love for the aesthetic without living in the countryside setting. These interiors show the farmhouse-style furniture, linens, and various knicknacks that would exist in the space. The objects are frequently cluttered and mismatched to create a cozy and carefree atmosphere and are frequently connotative of grandparents, such as quilts, tea sets, and vintage crockery. However, unlike other kitschy aesthetics, these items tend to be practical and have a united aesthetic with similar motifs and a limited color palette. Continuing with the nature motifs, plants are frequently featured in interiors, with flowers, potted plants, and floral and strawberry motifs on various mediums. Labor and handicrafts associated with the cottage lifestyle, and the results from it, are incredibly popular. See activities for a list of full details. Animals found within the setting are another photographic subject. The ones showcased are either domesticated animals such as cows, cats, dogs, ducks, rabbits, and sheep, or wild animals that would exist in the same field and forest setting such as frogs, mice, butterflies, and squirrels. These animals would be considered \"cute\" and are often in poses that carry across docility and relaxation. For example, cats sleeping on windowsills or frogs crossing their arms. Food is another important visual of the aesthetic. The results of foraging: baskets full of mushrooms, berries, and other fresh fruits celebrate the Earth's bounty and the joy found in the activity. Baked goods, bread, and other sweet foods also contribute a cozy atmosphere to the aesthetic, as it carries across the warmth and romantic labor associated with making it. This is almost always traditional Western. Fruit pies, loaves of bread, jars of jam and honey, pancakes, Victoria sponges, and other rustic cakes are the most common. Books, an outlet for fantasy and independent learning, are frequent. These are always vintage with a romantic storybook or classical feel with either antique leather and canvas or more approchable secondhand paperbacks. In connection with this, journals and letters are also considered part of the aesthetic as they convey the tenderness and intimacy associated with doing things with one's hands. Writing and reading will be expanded further in the activities section. Another common medium of imagery of the aesthetic are illustrations. Botanical encyclopedias prior to the widespread use of colored photography are the most common. These watercolors provide detailed views of plants, typically flowers, in a way that evokes both the natural subject and the romanticization of naturalists' dedication to the subject matter during the era. Victorian to 1930s illustration, specifically of children's literature, is another important source of both inspiration and actual involvement in the aesthetic. Fairies and anthropromorphic animals (such as those of Beatrix potter's works) are the most common. These are done in a more detailed and naturalistic style in watercolor and ink. However, as cottagecore became popular, artists who specialize in digital and more simplistic art introduced a flatter and more cute style. There is a wide range of outfit styles that could fit into the Cottagecore aesthetic. Cottagecore fashion tends to fall into either a hyper-feminine, modernized interpretation of historical fashion or a more practical and cozy outfit that includes elements of whimsy. In most interpretations, the silhouette is more modest than mainstream fashion, with a longer, loose-fitting, flowy dresses and skirts often (but not always) reminiscent of housework wear from the 1900s-50s. The colors in Cottagecore tend to be naturally occurring, pastel, or faded colours, including brown, baby pink, olive green, ivory, maroon, beige, ochre, dusty rose pink, light yellow, and baby blue. Patterns such as stripes, paisley, delicate floral, and gingham are popular within the aesthetic. The fabrics are most often natural, such as in cotton, linens, knitted yarn, etc. Lace and embroidery are some common trimmings. Many of these clothes are vintage and purchased secondhand, such as from thrift stores or vintage shops. This is in line with the appreciation for the environment and sustainability, as well as the fact that many Cottagecore pieces are highly sought-after because of their rarity in modern times and un-replicable unique design, such as in Gunne Sax dresses, Edwardian blouses, and antique aprons. A core tenent of the fashion aspect is also DIY, with OP-made crochet, handsewing, knitting, and jewelry making being incorporated into outfits. However, as the aesthetic has become incredibly popular, it reached fast fashion, and many clothes found in mall brands have elements of Cottagecore motifs, especially with milkmaid tops. The tops included in Cottagecore are extremely varied, but still keep in line with the nature-oriented aesthetic. Puffy poet or Edwardian-inspired blouses that include lace, ruffle, embroidery, or ribbon details are incredibly popular in the vintage/historical style that leans towards fantasy or elegance. These pieces are often found vintage, as this style was extremely popular in 70s romantic fashion. Some looks also include tee shirts that have a print that relates to the aesthetic. Vests, corsets, shawls, and other layering pieces are also often used as a way to introduce texture and color on the upper portion of the outfit. Cottagecore fashion commonly involves: The hair and make-up of Cottagecore is either naturalistic, or in more fantastical interpretations, with fairy-like motifs. Hair that is kept long is associated with tradition and femininity. Long hair that is loose tends to be in waves or braids. Accessories, such as bags, hats, jewelry and tech accessories that fit the cottagecore aesthetic tend to have visuals of flowers, trees, fairies, cute forest animals such as (deers, squirrels, butterflies), cabins & cottages, mushrooms, and fruits such as strawberries. By year released While the cottagecore aesthetic is not necessarily an organized political movement with stated goals or leaders, much of the conversation around cottagecore is political, especially given the aesthetic has become infamous for its association with two directly opposed political groups with radically different outlooks on life despite the shared frustration with modernity. While the opposition to modern life is shared among Cottagecore adherents across the political spectrum, what is specifically being opposed tends to vary. For more progressive-leaning followers of the aesthetic, it is particularly capitalism as well as heteronormativity. While many people involved in cottagecore identify with an ideology that more concretely advocates for the restructuring of society, they may also express a dislike of capitalism in a more casual tone through or alongside cottagecore.[10] Many progressive-leaning members of the cottagecore community reject heteronormative gender roles and seek to remove the stigma and stereotypes of traditional life from the aesthetics and culture of times past. Cottagecore enjoys niche popularity within the LGBTQ+ community, particularly among lesbian and bisexual women, for this reason. Many express dissatisfaction with the roles and expectations placed on them in a heteronormative society. Some have suggested that cottagecore presents an ideal world in which young people are able to express their personality freely in a rural space, contrasting the homophobia or transphobia faced by young people in rural areas.[11] On the other side of the political spectrum, another more controversial large community subscribing to the aesthetic is the Tradwife movement[12], found largely on Instagram and Facebook's \"Politigram\" community.[13] Contrasting the progressive Cottagecore community, the rightist adherents to the aesthetic proclaim their opposition to modernity is based on a loss of conservative values in the 21st Century and fondness for a pre- rather than a post-capitalist economic system. Tradwives specifically are described as women who \"embrace 'submissive' heteronormative lifestyles involving homemaking and child-rearing and reject feminism\" according to Wikipedia. Members of the tradwife movement often utilize cottagecore imagery, fashion, memes, and aesthetics to promote their views. They may also romanticize the revitalization of traditional heteronormative gender roles for women, a popular aspect of far-right ideology. Even further niche is the utilization of Cottagecore imagery and inspired memes by Eco-fascist[14] and Eco-nationalist circles who openly and intentionally uphold western colonialist and eurocentric views as an ideal as opposed to accidentally as was the criticism for Progressive Cottagecore followers. However, those within the Tradwife movement often do not associate openly with the cottagecore community and the two sides oppose each other.[15] The music associated with Cottagecore evokes comfort and gentleness through low and soft vocals and acoustic mid-tempo instrumentation. In lyrics, there would be references to either gentle love and/or nature. Most of this style/aesthetic seems to have originated in the Hippie, Folk, and baroque pop scenes of the late 60s, which was heavily influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Many artists, men and women, embraced a soft, pastoral, prairie style and wore poet shirts, lacy maxi dresses, and flowers (examples include The Carpenters and Donovan). This continued into the 70s soft rock scene (Fleetwood Mac being of key importance) and through the 80s revival of baroque pop in Post-Punk (like Shelleyan Orphan and Virginia Astley). Some dream pop and indie rock of the late 80s and early 90s continued somewhat in this vein, although their external aesthetic had become more contemporary over time. In the modern era, much sudo-indie rock and pop is used. In this regard Dark Folk and other genres tend to slip in and, although related, are definitely not as closely connected to the imagery that lead to Cottagecore’s development and are more visually related to Cottagegore. Official Aesthetics Wiki playlist The Aesthetics Wiki staff creates official Spotify playlists for aesthetics, which compile the songs most frequently featured on existing playlists dedicated to those aesthetics. Pages with an official wiki playlist will not include playlists from the public. The activities associated with Cottagecore are defined by the typical activities one can do within the cottage space. Bloomcore is an aesthetic that is similar to Cottagecore in many ways, but has more of a centralized focus on flowers and gardening in a small, quaint village. Cottagegore is a darker take on the Cottagecore aesthetic with more of a focus on the more negative aspects of cottage and natural life that Cottagecore often tries to veer away from. Honeycore is an aesthetic based around the rural production and consumption of goods such as honey, bread, and waffles. It is similar to Cottagecore in that agricultural imagery and values are emphasized, but the visuals are streamlined to create a color palette of mostly pale yellows and browns. In many of the pictures that can be classified into the Honeycore aesthetic, bees, honey, or flowers can be seen and there is a big emphasis on agriculture and conservation of bees. Southwest Cottagecore moves away from the forest-inspired, green color palette of cottagecore. The willows and vines are switched out with succulents. The main aspects are quite identical, just adapted to more southern/western life. Instead of a stone cottage, you may prefer an adobe house framed by yuccas. The fashion becomes more suited for warm weather and is generally paired with warm colors and the occasional nautical, whimsical look, characterized by run-down shacks on the coast and beach grass. Lizards, rabbits, snakes, and hawks are characteristic of the aesthetic. Many critics of Cottagecore point out that the trendification of rural practices and ways of life would be harmful to the environment. High populations of settlers would overpopulate the areas, ironically driving out the practices that Cottagecore enthusiasts strive for. For example, foraging could not be supported if hundreds do it, as the humans who do so would quickly exhaust the availability of the resources. Then, as the berry bushes reduce in amount, disrupting the ecosystem and causing possible ecological collapse. The fact that Cottagecore content creators create Cottagecore content is also, ironically, contradictory to the aesthetic. The things associated with social media, such as having to build a brand, tracking trends, and even advertising the aesthetic, are contrary to Cottagecore emphasis on nature and disconnecting from these alienating websites. In seeing Cottagecore as a way to make content and have social media approval, the messaging becomes lost. Not necessarily problematic, but another criticism is the unrealistic \"fairy tale\" image of rural life. Some rural dwellers are exasperated with the ignorance of these internet users, as the aesthetic does not display the difficult labor associated with farming, animal husbandry, and handicrafts.[17] This is especially contrasted with the visuals that are incongruous to the claims of self-sufficiency by Cottagecore enthusiasts. English manors necessitate servants and groundskeepers, gowns do not fit the agricultural lifestyle, real farm equipment does not appear, the materials cost money that could not be supported with small-scale farming and crafts, etc. People concerned with farming rights also claim that over-romanticization encourages an ignorant perspective on the actual lives of farmworkers, which are incredibly difficult, with back-breaking labor and economic issues. A false narrative of the farming lifestyle may encourage ignorance that patronizes the real lives of farmhands as the fans claim that they wish they were that occupational class. Counterarguments claim that Cottagecore is an outlet for fantasy; the enthusiasts do not plan to actually move into these areas and survive on subsistance farming and experience hard labor. Instead, they try to incorporate it through small activities that they could realistically achieve in their daily non-rural lives. The aesthetic does not cause socio-economic issues, and the critics' claims are virtue-signaling and cynical exaggeration that puts down the interests of women, discourages diversity of interests, and takes away from the virtues of the aesthetic. One criticism of Cottagecore is its lack of diversity and representation. The aesthetic often portrays a predominantly white, heteronormative, and able-bodied image, which can exclude and marginalize individuals from different backgrounds and identities. This lack of representation can perpetuate narrow beauty standards and limit inclusivity within the aesthetic. Some critics argue that Cottagecore promotes traditional gender roles and expectations, depicting women in domestic and nurturing roles. This can reinforce gender stereotypes and limit the exploration of diverse gender identities and expressions. Specifically, the Tradwife aspect (and even non-tradwives) claim that women and people are \"meant\" to find domestic labor more fulfilling than modern work. The popularization of an aesthetic leads to commercialization that is not in line with the ethos of Cottagecore sustainability. As the fashion industry took note of the rising trend, they kept up with demand through fast fashion practices that abuse the workers, pollute the environment, and take away from the labor of handmade and ethical fashion. On Tumblr, Cottagecore is often used as a descriptor for the portrayal of lesbianism as nonsexual, inherently wholesome, and idyllic. As Tumblr was popular among many lesbians, the aesthetic of lesbians often included images and wishful textposts about women doing domestic labor, cuddling, and other images of idealized love. However, this has a negative repercussion; some lesbians are against their fellow lesbians and themselves being \"predatory,\" which is their interpretation of normal feelings of sexual attraction. Online culture made the ideal image of lesbianism as women acting in a Cottagecore manner, which often does not include masculine presentations, sexual behavior, and conflict. Gender roles connect to this, as the idea that women are inherently more wholesome and domestically inclined leads to lesbians' self-image being this.

It tends to also cross over with other dark aesthetics, like Dark Academia, Crowcore, and Vulture Culture. The things that differentiate Cottagegore from Cottagecore include: There also tends to be less of an emphasis on the farming aspect that is often seen in regular Cottagecore and has more of a Witchy/Esoteric vibe to it, like a witch living out in the middle of the woods, cut off from civilization, and only relying on her coven of fellow witches to get by in the harsh elements of mother nature. Cottagegore has a reverence for mother nature as a force and an entity that can be incredibly destructive. Cottagegore tends to take the Cottagecore fashion aesthetic and runs it through more of a Gothic lens. The fashion consists of black flouncy dresses, black overalls, and old black clothing that can be worn while living a quiet, solitary farm life. While Cottagecore is best represented by folk, baroque pop, and dream pop, Cottagegore fits better with dark folk, neoclassical darkwave, and experimental music. Artists like Dead Can Dance and Shawn James have used similar aesthetics in their work. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

Farmers and ranchers within the community value tradition and conservative ideals, community, and hard work in their field. The aesthetic places great emphasis on practicality, with a range of activities and items originating from their work and landscape. The style is popular with many people throughout the United States, even if they are not farmers or ranchers, and has been used as a visual trope for weddings, settings for TV shows, and political propaganda. Visually, the aesthetic shares many traits with Western, but there is no emphasis on the 19th century, adventure or lawlessness, and instead focuses on the idea of home and being settled within the farmer lifestyle. And unlike Cottagecore, which romanticizes the countryside and uses feminine aesthetics, Country is a lived reality, even if some visual tropes are used to the point of excess. The people who participate in this aesthetic are unlikely to be aware of the aesthetic community as a whole. The lifestyle has cemented itself among the American mainstream, with it being a theme of multiple home decorating magazines, clothing brands, and even personality types. It is a point of pride for many people to be a \"country girl/boy,\" as their culture emphasizes patriotism and values that are atypical for many modern cities. The Country Girl blends this aesthetic with teenaged Girl-Next-Door manners and personality types, and are typically depicted as innocent, relatable, and kind-hearted. The aesthetics are a more traditionally feminine interpretation, and would not emphasize traditionally masculine activities as much and would instead focus on gentleness and beauty. However, they typically would be able to handle themselves in these activities as needed, and are quite experienced in animal husbandry and homemaking. Country girls are typically teenagers, and storylines and aesthetics concerning them would focus around High School Dream-esque concepts of becoming independent from their fathers, first love, and experiencing the big city (and returning home). These women are often horse girls, and paragons of Southern white femininity. The best example is Taylor Swift's persona during the start of her career. The aesthetic involves elements of Cottagecore and Shabby Chic. In addition to the rough-and-tumble aesthetics, there will be traditionally feminine tropes such as: The eponymous music genre is the type of music that these people listen to.

These spaces are both small enough to avoid being found for as long as one wants and large enough to be comfortable. Hideaway spaces are typically associated with children, as these comfortable spaces are seen as childhood things that older people grow out of both physically and mentally as teenagers face the world. However, adulthood has many cozy aspects, especially linked with more domestic practices, which can be seen in Comfy/Cozy.

The term is very popular on Tumblr and among school kids. The aesthetic has no relations with actual drugs. Chaos and signs of 'dumbassery' can be found everywhere, and so can spilled foods, chipped fingernails, wet socks, lost wallets, unbrushed hair, disorganized workspaces, etc, which are all examples of the eternal presence of a Crackhead. Many of the visual examples of the Crackhead aesthetic show messy rooms or houses, but this is not the entire idea of this aesthetic. Some other examples show people doing strange or foolish activities or pictures that might make you question their existence. Some of these ideas may have some aspects of Weirdcore. Crackhead’s sole purpose is to confuse you. In many ways, this aesthetic is a pain to look at, especially for perfectionists. This might be because of its uncountable imperfections. The messy room part of Crackhead is unique to this aesthetic, but the items in the mess and how big the mess is might be similar to Trashcore.  Other Crackhead visual aesthetic cues include: Crackhead fashion is generally very casual and comfy, including sweatpants, baggy clothing, stained clothing and often accompanied by highly fashionable accessories such as smartphones with broken screens. The style is very urban, similar to Grunge fashion and dollar store clothes. Colors often associated with Crackhead are red, symbolizing the blood shed by a stubbed toe, yellow for your pee (because you haven't been drinking enough water!!), brown, for that sauce you spilled on your shirt, black, and gray. Crackhead fashion is less about what one wears, but what one does with what one wears, but the general theme is chaos, chaotic and confusing get-ups, while not necessarily cursed. Dumbass Memers are members of the Crackhead community who also enjoy Surreal Memes. Dumbass Memers are known for their ironic and often nonsensical sense of humor and social commentary while retaining all aspects of their Dumbass nature. Bastardass is the fusion of Crackhead and Bastardcore. Bastardass merges both the cursedness and fight-or-flight-activating elements of Bastardcore and combines them with the equally chaotic, clumsy but lovable traits of a Dumbass.",

The most popular craftcore visual and activity is embroidery, but the aesthetic encompasses a variety of other craft activities and crafted items. Crafts have existed for a long time. However, the word \"Craftcore\" hasn't been used for this aesthetic until the late 2010s. In a society where most products are made by machines and robots, appreciating crafts and the craftsmanship that goes into it is something that has become lost on many members of society. Luckily, many people are still enjoying making and buying handmade items. Just like Cottagecore, Craftcore may be seen as an aesthetic that longs for simplicity and self-sustainability. However, Craftcore is not anti-tech. Using the newest tools for crafts is not looked down upon. Craftcore does not have a clear fashion guideline (it is very versatile and easy to combine with other aesthetics), although the following do fit the Craftcore aesthetic: Craftcore is centered around hobbies and activities. (Note: the point of Craftcore is not to \"do as many crafts as you can\", but it is about loving and appreciating handmade items, whether that is via one craft or more.  Remember; quality over quantity.) Craftcore does not have to be expensive. Even though professional tools (such as a good sewing machine) are expensive, you can participate in this aesthetic by, for example, just buying embroidery needles ($3-6 USD), yarn ($4-8), and possibly embroidery hoops ($20-20) to start embroidering your clothes.

Cripplepunk involves accepting and loving oneself for, not despite of, disabilities, mobility aids, and the struggles that come with them. It also rejects the myth of disabled people as \"inspirational\" heroes simply because they have a disability, and that they have to be perfectly nice and submissive to be respected by able-bodied people. Many people involved in Cripplepunk bond over their struggles, being treated as lesser by able-bodied people, and the ableism in the medical industry and society as a whole. Cripplepunk is for physically disabled people specifically. Cripplepunk was created by the late Tumblr user @crpl-pnk[1](real name Tyler Trewhella), after they posted a picture of them standing with their cane, a cigarette dangling out of their mouth, with the caption \"cripple punk\" and the description \"i'm starting a movement.\" It was reblogged and liked by 40,000+ people, and the caption \"cripplepunk\" became used as a tag for physically disabled people fighting against the norms placed on them by society. Disabled people used the tag to share tips with each other about medication, discussed their experiences with ableism, shared art, and generally celebrated each other and practiced solidarity. Cripplepunk aims to normalize disabilities and accessibility, and as such, Cripplepunk activists fight for closed captions, image descriptions, wheelchair ramps, feeding tubes, cheaper mobility aids, and recognition of intersectionality in disabled spaces. Cripplepunk is not an aesthetic but rather a political movement, and as such there is no strictly associated style. Crust punk style inspirations are somewhat popular among cripplepunks, and so is the customisation of mobility aids, including adding spikes or chains. Under construction.

Most fans of the aesthetic are a part of, or want to be a part of, a community that gets to solve something beyond themselves with their friends and witness something strange and fantastical. Alternatively, some people interested in the aesthetic empathize or even want to be a cryptid themselves. Many parts of Cryptidcore have been inspired from media associated with cryptids and conspiracies, such as Gravity Falls, Twin Peaks, Welcome to Night Vale, Sightings, Unsolved Mysteries and The X-Files. Cryptidcore enthusiasts are often fans of these fictional works, and a love for cryptids and mysteries often comes from the love for the original works. The visual aspects of Cryptidcore originate largely from the places these cryptids are allegedly located in (mostly the forests and deserts of the United States), as well as the kitschy tourist trap culture capitalizing on the people who have a fascination with these cryptids. Cryptidcore is also generally vintage, and takes visual inspiration, especially in regard to fashion, from the 1970s - 90s. This is largely due to the rise of tabloids and fiction revolving around these mysteries during that time. In the early 1970s, after countless horror and sci-fi films and shows, a new breed of speculative horror was born. The TV show Kolchak: The Night Stalker centered on a reporter who researched aliens, vampires, and Bigfoot in night-shrouded forests, sewers, city, and suburban environments. This went on to inspire the most famous occult-detective TV shows, namely David Lynch’s Twin Peaks and The X-Files (although neither had as much to do with cryptid mythology as The Night Stalker did). These continued on the aesthetic of After Hours-type environments added with the threat of supernatural horror. During the early-to-mid-2010s, it was common for fandoms to create moodboards that encapsulate the aesthetic of the work or certain characters. Scooby-Doo (1969), Twin Peaks (1990), The X-Files (1993), Welcome to Night Vale (2012), Gravity Falls (2012), and Buzzfeed Unsolved (2016) are some fandoms that had a strong moodboard culture.[1] These works of fiction are all in the same sort of genre of supernatural and cryptid-oriented mysteries. Many fans thus are a part of all of these fandoms and noticed the similarities in the aesthetic to tie these works together under the Cryptidcore umbrella. The term \"Cryptidcore\" first emerged from tumblr user on-a-crescendo in 2014, where they give a list of visuals, such as \"kitschy t shirts and keychains from souvenir shops depicting the local urban legends and monsters,\" \"tin foil hats,\" and \"muffled x files, gravity falls, and twilight zone theme songs playing in the distance.\"[2] This post gained popularity, and the tag was born. As the text post was passed around and fans of different media made moodboards, the fans of Cryptidcore started to make aesthetic posts outside the context of fandom. Many Cryptidcore elements also originated from the Regional Gothic trend on tumblr in 2015. Much of the trend was focused on elements of mystery, unreality, and the uncanny valley. Images such as deer in darkness, forests, diners, etc. in the Regional Gothic trend were popular, and have clear crossover with Cryptidcore. Cryptidcore includes fashion that is casual, vintage, and retro style. Preferenced to practical and comfy outfits, typically with browns, beige and muted colours. Some of the clothing would be things such as: A few of the most popular cryptids amongst the cryptidcore folk include: The cryptids in the world are innumerable and cannot be encapsulated within a single list. It is encouraged that you do research to find your local cryptids. Cryptidcore music is either directly about cryptids, supernatural entities, or eerie feelings. Common genres include alternative, electropunk, indie, and rock. External resources to learn more about the aesthetic",

Cubism has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century. The movement was pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, joined by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, and Fernand Léger. One primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne. Cubism formed an important link between early 20th century art and architecture. The historical, theoretical, and socio-political relationships between avant-garde practices in painting, sculpture and architecture had early ramifications in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia. Though there are many points of intersection between Cubism and architecture, only a few direct links between them can be drawn. Most often the connections are made by reference to shared formal characteristics: faceting of form, spatial ambiguity, transparency, and multiplicity. While Cubism was primarily an art movement that focussed on visual arts, there were some authors who were influenced by Cubism. This influenced the use of an internal landscape (for characters), stream of consciousness, multiple perspectives, and fragmentation of the individual[1]. Czech Cubism (referred to more generally as Cubo-Expressionism) was an avant-garde art movement of Czech proponents of Cubism. Czech Cubists distinguish their work through the construction of sharp points, slicing planes, and crystalline shapes in their art works.These angles allowed the Czech Cubists to incorporate their own trademark in the avant-garde art group of Modernism. They believed that objects carried their own inner energy which \ncould only be released by splitting the horizontal and vertical surfaces that restrain the conservative design and “ignore the needs of the human soul.” It was a way to revolt from the typical art scene in the \nearly 1900s in Europe. This style originated in Czechslovakia during the First repulic as well. It found its use in architecture in early 1920's with introduction of ovals and round shapes on cubistic buildings. Orphism or Orphic Cubism, a term coined by the French poet Guillaume Apollinaire in 1912, was an offshoot of Cubism that focused on pure abstraction and bright colors, influenced by Fauvism, the theoretical writings of Paul Signac, Charles Henry and the dye chemist Eugène Chevreul. Tubism is a term coined by the art critic Louis. Vauxcelles in 1911 to describe the style of French artist Fernand Léger. Crystal Cubism is a distilled form of Cubism with a strong emphasis on flat surface activity and large overlapping geometric planes. The primacy of the underlying geometric structure, rooted in the abstract, controls practically all of the elements of the artwork.",

It often involves imagery that hints towards idealization, religious symbols, mind control, and god complexes. From a media standpoint, Cultcore media is based on stories, real or false, of people following false, unrealistic leaders and ideals and the longing for purity but being corrupted. It can also consist of escaping or overthrowing a cult when it comes to a visual story or the stories in the media. Cultcore has been criticized for misrepresenting cults and minimizing the extremely negative effects many cults have on members.[1][2] Cultcore also has been described as a harmful aesthetic as it aestheticizes cults, ritual abuse, and trauma based mind control. Cultcore visuals include groups of people, usually all in black or white clothing, candles, crosses, light gore, open skies,  rainbows, and VHS tapes. Cryptic or spiritual figures and settings such as churches, forests, and remote communes are often used. Quotes of phrases, words and especially chants relevant to control, religion, power, and corruption are popular. Imagery that has become emblematic of certain cults in history, such as purple Kool-Aid or black Adidas tracksuits may also be used as a reference.",

This is not the topic of the page. The claim that \"kawaii\" is an inappropriate term was created by trolls on 4chan and does not reflect the beliefs of the kawaii community and Japanese people. Cutecore (also known as Cutegore) is an online aesthetic including image edits that combine typical kawaii imagery with slight traces of gore. Characters are often depicted with wounds, blood splatters, glitches, pixelations, and otherwise horrific motifs, as well as bedrooms with kawaii decor and bloodstains on the wall or tall dark figures. The aesthetic is often conflated with Kawaii over its name, when in reality the term \"Cutecore\" was choosen in order to avoid shadowbans on social media triggered by mentions of the term \"gore\". The term \"Cutecore\" first emerged around the mid-2010s as short variant of \"cute but hardcore/brutal\" and was commonly used as the name of a music genre that combined the typical hardcore sound with kawaii noises. Many of the cover images resembled what would be now considered the average Cutecore edit with depictions of violence and blood. As an aesthetic, Cutecore was coined and popularized by the Tumblr user Vo1dchan in 2020 who would often post gloomy or morbid pictures of their overly kawaii room, often also sporting McDonald's bags in the background. Cutecore is based around the sentiment of corrupted childhood as its overall visuals. However, it is rather similar to Traumacore by the way that images are edited and the way it makes references to murder and trauma. The base for the aesthetic is media aimed at children and preteens of which images then get manipulated to adhere to the sentiment of a corrupted childhood. These can go many ways, such as adding blood, ominous shadow figures and eyes. This aesthetic is highly popular on TikTok, another social media app, sometimes used as a joke. The typical aesthetic edits can also be used to cope with trauma. This section lists media that is commonly used as part of the Cutecore aesthetic, often in the form of edits, rather than the typical visuals being featured within the media. Songs frequently used as part of the aesthetic include: Ever since the \"kawaii is a slur\" discourse that occured primarily on TikTok in 2021 [1], the aesthetic was getting accused of being a \"whitewashed\" version of Kawaii due to the term Cutecore being misunderstood as a western replacement word for it. There was also the argument of people saying \"Kawaii translates to cute\" or \"Just use Cutecore, it makes more sense\" despite it being a gore-centric aesthetic.[2] The term 'Cutecore' was deliberately selected for the aesthetic to disassociate itself from 'gore' terminology within media and avoid any negative connotations previously associated with the latter. Cutecore often faces backlash for problematic individuals who engage in the aesthetic and its community. There has been a prevalence of people who abuse the aesthetic to glorify violence, self-harm, and CSA within its media as well as general toxic behavior (harassment, suicide baiting, etc).[3] Like any aesthetic linked to Kawaii, there have been accusations of yellowface towards Cutecore as well. Occasionally, Cutecore also gets criticized for 'ruining' characters from well-known series aimed at children. Backlash frequently arises from within the community concerning items from brands such as Sanrio, Mezzo Piano, and San-X, with criticisms centered on their perceived overpricing, whether they are regular items or collector's items, largely being attributed to the Cutecore aesthetic.

It also takes elements from Frutiger Aero such as auroras, glass/glossy textures, and sometimes a modern or even utopian look, this bears a resemblance to Icepunk due to them both having a sanitized and clean feel to them and using ice in an abstract form. However, Cyber Glacier imagery tends to be more refined and saturated, as well as being more commercialized. When people started talking about this aesthetic again, some argued that Frutiger Glacier is just a rebranded version of Y2K Futurism with the “Frutiger” title slapped on top, while others argued that if aesthetics such as Helvetica Aqua and Frutiger Eco are allowed to be separated from Frutiger Aero then Frutiger Glacier should be too. As a settlement for this argument, the name has been changed to Cyber Glacier rather than Frutiger Glacier as it is usually visually closer to Y2K Futurism than it is to Frutiger Aero (in most cases at least).",

The term Cyber Stylin' can be used to generalize the common art styles during the time period, as well as virtual/pixel games, drawings, and illustrations meant for young girls at the time. Despite the name Cyber Stylin' being a blanket term, there are many different art styles within it, usually depending on the artist. Cyber Stylin' originates from virtual dress up games that were first made in the 90s. These games soon started to explode in popularity in the 2000s, with there being countless of websites solely dedicated to dress up games by the late 2000s, early 2010s, and mid 2010s. For the most part, Cyber Stylin' is not limited to one specific look. The look of it can depend on the exact region that the doll, game, or drawing was made, as well as the personal style of the artist. However something that is consistent is a feminine/\"girly\" look, along with Y2K elements in the clothings/accesories like: Colors like pink, purple, white, brown, black, blue, and gold are also quite common in this style. It is not uncommon to see a more pastel color scheme or style of clothing. On the contrary, bold colors can also be seen. Dress up dolls and pixel dolls from some East Asian countries may sometimes have more of a cute or \"kawaii\" style, but not all do. Dance Pop and Electro Pop from the 2000s-2010s best suit Cyber Stylin' , however, music relating to modeling, runway walking, and catwalking also suit it. Theme songs for doll brands also work well, and in some cases, Hyperpop too. Enakei is a Korean digital art depicting young beautiful girls. The style is from the Korean artist Park Suran.[2] Generally, there are two types of Enakei styles. Jennie Enakei, a more realistic and airbrushed version of the style, and Enakei, a more cartoonish take on the style. A similar style seems to be done by an artist named Mellow J. This style seems to have originated from 2010-2012 Dollz are likely one of the oldest virtual dolls, first being made in 1997, originating from the website \"The Palace\".[3] Similar to the dress up games we know today, Dollz were customizable, allowing you to add clothes and hair to a base body. Dollz are some of the most iconic virtual paper dolls, even having online communities dedicated around them. There are 5 general styles of Dollz: Preps, Minis, Wonderkins, Silents, and Diva. Although Dollz are not as popular as they once were, they still do have a community surrounding them. Similar to Dollz, Candybar Dollmaker was a Korean version that was made in 2004. Compared to regular Dollz, Candybar Dollmaker not only allowed you to also customize a base body, but it was also very detailed. These games were very popular at the time, however it is difficult to find websites dedicated to them anymore. Shoujo, literally meaning girl in Japanese, is a type of anime/manga genre with the demographic of young girls. The art style is usually very cute, contains exaggerated features, and is very stylized when it comes to hair, makeup, and fashion. Although not all shoujo manga has the same look as other Cyber Stylin' styles do, many do, especially those from the late 90s to 2000s.

It was the fusion of cyberculture and the psychedelic subculture into a new counterculture of the late 1980s to mid-1990s. Much like the Hippies and Psychedelica, Cyberdelic is consistently linked with the Cyberpunk aesthetic of the '80s, though it should be noted the two are separate aesthetics in their own right. It also has overlap with Early Cyber. Dr. Timothy Leary, a popular figure in the Hippie counterculture movement due to his strong endorsement of utilizing psychedelic drugs (specifically LSD), got on board with the Cyberdelic movement to push virtual reality (as well as the utilization of \"smart drugs\") as the wave of the future to create a potential futuristic utopia in place of psychedelics. It was popularized by the emerging Rave scene and cyberculture of the late 1980s to mid-1990s, which lead to the aesthetic's peak with the release of the movie Hackers in 1995. It was commonly seen in advertisements, rave flyers, and media from the 1990s.[1] By the late 1990s, Cyberdelic and Early Cyber styles faded somewhat in favor of the newer Metalheart and Y2K Futurism aesthetics; its end was further hastened after the dot.com bubble burst in 2000. However, Cyberdelia has since gained ground again in the modern era as a form of escapism from the increasingly-dystopic reality that we currently face.[2] Because the Cyberdelic aesthetic had evolved since the first term was coined, now it has a wide variety of visuals. The only thing that hasn't changed is the philosophy, which is using technology as a medium to transcend into a virtual-psychedelic landscape. Cyberdelic fashion borrows heavily from elements of Cyberpunk and Cybergoth fashions (which makes sense, given Cyberdelic's close ties with the Cyberpunk culture in the 80s) with slight elements of Nintencore and Vaporwave mixed in for good measure. It's very bright, colorful, and cheery, but with a technological twist (a lot of LED charms and LED goggles can add to the effect of seeming otherworldly with your Cyberdelic fashion). More often than not, what most people would describe as Cyberpunk or Cybergoth music can easily blend in with the Cyberdelic aesthetic, as well as a lot of early Madchester music.  One album often cited as a prime example of Cyberdelic music is Billy Idol's 1993 flop album, Cyberpunk, due in part to the fact that, during the recording of this album, Idol was trying to re-invent his image and was also hanging around a lot with the aforementioned Timothy Leary.[2] External links to help get a better understanding of these aesthetics:",

It's orientated around a gritty depressing existence and a state of being 'terminally online', with visuals such as old work machines, haphazard cables, and concepts such as the abandonment of the physical body and flesh due to uploading your consciousness onto the Wired (the sum of all human communication and networks). This is where Serial Experiments Lain, a 90s anime comes into play. This aesthetic is less staged, consisting of images with nice filters but made more low quality for a more authentic look, essentially serving the terminally online weeb realness. It also doesn't shy away from using things like Wojaks or other memes in its imagery. Cyberneticpunk is also often linked with things like Accelerationism[1], Anarcho-Transhumanism, CyberNihlism, and XenoFeminism. On Twitter it is also linked with a community called SlimeMoldTWT which posits the idea that since there are no justified hierarchies, that one must become slime as the skeleto-motor coordination system is 'authoritarian' and so on. This is where the green circle emoji in people's display names comes into play. As it is anarchist, it also ends up tying in with concepts like three printing of regulated items: Counter-economics, Bitcoin, and Crypto-anarchism. Due to this, it often also includes aesthetic elements related to the books Fanged Noumena, Meltdown, CCRU Writings 1997-2003 i.e. the Numogram, the cover of Fanged Noumena, Neo-China, the superiority of technology, and the extinction of humans at the hands of AI, and also to the works of Deleuze and Guattari which is why often jargon used by Deleuze and Guattari is common, which means words like 'Body without organs' and 'Deterritorialization' apply here too. It is also important to note the Neo-China aesthetics and also Sinofuturism are utilised sometimes, the latter having been described as a science fiction work that already exists.",

The word is an amalgam of the prefix \"cyber-\", referring to cybernetics, and \"paradism\" as in paradise, meaning that a paradisal aspect has to be present within the cybernetic part of the aesthetic. The paradisal aspect can either manifest itself in literal terms as it would when representing a derivation of a Garden of Eden or the Elysian Fields, or alternatively in a more abstract way as a reflection of a utopia state of things. It differs itself from Cyberprep insofar that not only the positive benefits of technological progress are a central tenet, but that said technological progress has reached a level of sophistication where the principles of economics and conventional labour are fundamentally transformed in such that the subjects at hand can and are likely to pursue higher goals of scientific, technological, civilizatory and/or spiritual fulfillment. This pursuit of higher goals is reflected in the societal structures of Cyberparadism. While smaller communities or highly dense urban pods are common, they are often highly interconnected and work towards shared goals, such as preserving the environment or advancing scientific research. This emphasis on cooperation and shared purpose is a hallmark of Cyberparadism, and is made possible by the advanced technology that has allowed for a post-scarcity society. In Cyberparadism, the paradisal aspect is not just a surface-level aesthetic choice, but a fundamental part of the subgenre's philosophy. By incorporating technology in a way that enhances and preserves the natural world, Cyberparadism offers a vision of a future that is not only sustainable, but also fulfilling and meaningful for its inhabitants. It challenges the assumption that progress must come at the expense of the environment, and presents a hopeful alternative where humans and nature can thrive together in harmony. The utopian view of a highly technological future isn't new. At the beginning of the 20th century, some artists, designers and architects wanted to break away with the status quo of their time: the styles of the Victorian era and the Belle Époque. Revivals of historic styles were popular in the 19th and very early 20th centuries: Neoclassicism, Gothic Revival, Rococo Revival, Renaissance Revival etc. Some artists, designers and architects felt that these revivals didn't reflect their time, and especially the way the world changed with the Industrial Revolution. The avant-gardistes of the early 20th century thought that they could reform the world through design and architecture. They had a very optimist view on the changes machines and technology would bring to the world, wanting to be as separate as possible from the past. Futurism and De Stijl were two movements with this mindset. As part of the Italian Futurist movement, architect Antonio Sant'Elia produced many drawings that illustrate his visions for the city of the future. Futurist architecture featured no ornamentation, unusual angles, sharp edges, slopes, domes, sleek lines and metal components, but also skyscrapers with high bridges and suspended walkways. Further manifestos of the movement followed that celebrated modern life, calling for a break with the past and an embrace of technology, war, speed and the future. Similar, but not that radical, were the artists, designers and architects of the Art Deco movement, during the interwar period. They embraced the machine and the use of new materials, like bakelite and chrome-plated elements, but used historic sources of inspiration too, like Ancient Egypt (see 1920s Egyptomania), Greco-Roman antiquity or Sub-Saharan Africa. Unlike Futurist or De Stijl artists, Art Deco designers and architects decorated their designs. The movement had different phases and substyles, one of them being Streamline Modern, in which rounded, smoothly finished and often teardrop-shaped aerodynamic shapes are used. Many Streamline Modern buildings from the 1930s have their corner rounded, long horizontal windows (aka ribbon windows), and little to no ornamentation, looking like huge machines or vehicles. During the early 1970s, High-tech architecture appeared. The style celebrates and exposes the construction of buildings. It embraces the decorative possibilities of pipes, air ducts, escalators, lifts and other elements that would normally be hidden within the internal structure. Overall, the style focused on the concept of showing how technology can improve the world by dramatizing and drawing attention to technical features. The Pompidou Centre in Paris (1971-1977), designed by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, is a good example of High-tech architecture. Cyberparadism focuses on the positive use of technology and scientific progress in order to make the human experience more enjoyable. While Cyberparadism is an aesthetics that can be represented in fiction and fictional media, there is also an aesthetic tendency in contemporary endeavor and therefore be found in real-world instances. The setting of Cyperparadism can vary from depictions of obvious utopian societies on planet Earth and/or other other planets and ecosystems, to almost primitively looking societies that have managed to achieve minimalism through scientific and technological means. One of the defining characteristics of Cyberparadism is its flexibility in terms of setting. While the subgenre is often associated with depictions of lush and untouched natural environments, Cyberparadism can be applied to a wide range of settings and contexts. This can include depictions of highly advanced societies on other planets, where technology has been used to create self-sustaining ecosystems and achieve a post-scarcity economy. At the same time, Cyberparadism can also be applied to more grounded and earthbound settings, where societies have achieved minimalism through scientific and technological means. This can include depictions of off-the-grid communities that rely on renewable energy and sustainable agriculture, or even depictions of individuals who have used technology to simplify their lives and reduce their environmental impact. The setting of Cyberparadism is less important than the ethos and values that underlie it. Whether it takes place in a futuristic utopia or a small off-the-grid community, Cyberparadism is characterized by a focus on harmonious relationship with nature, positive use of technology, cooperation, and the enjoyment of life's pleasures. It is a subgenre that celebrates the beauty and power of nature, while also acknowledging the potential of technology to enhance and enrich the human experience. The use of space is also an important aspect of Cyberparadism. Broadly, it can be said that wide open wild and untamed landscapes, can be either void barren landscapes as one would find on an Mars-like exoplanet or fully covered with dense succulent nature, is a hallmark of the Cyberparadism aesthethic, the centerpiece always is an enclosed place where human interaction happens. Very much like the paradisiacal Garden of Eden allegedly was an enclosed place, Cyberparadism puts human in the context of living within a small subset, highly sophisticated and well designed, of the broader surrounding landscape. Etymologically, the word garden comes from enclosure, a fenced place. In Cyberparadism, these enclosed places are carefully designed to be efficient and minimalist, with a focus on sustainability and functionality. The use of space in Cyberparadism is not just about maximizing efficiency, but also about creating a sense of community and connection with the surrounding landscape. Think broad, large plazas, forums, agoras, open-air auditoriums, or Greek-styled theaters. Building materials here could be anything from shiny, white ceramics to natural stonemasonry like marble or even a bright-colored type of durable concrete. The official motto of Cyberparadism is the following one: This motto reflects the Cyberparadism's optimistic outlook on the future and the potential of technology to enhance the human experience. This statement speaks to the aesthetics's belief that, through the responsible use of technology, we can create a world of abundance and prosperity for all. At its core, Cyberparadism is about using technology and scientific progress to create a better future for humanity. This can include the development of sustainable closed-loop high-gain energy systems, the use of advanced medical technologies to enhance quality of life and prolonge the life time span, and the creation of new and innovative approaches to social and economic issues. By harnessing the power of technology in this way, Cyberparadism believes that we can overcome scarcity, inequality, and other challenges that prevent us from achieving our full potential. Furthermore, Cyberparadism recognizes that technology alone is not enough to create a better world. It must be used in a responsible and thoughtful way, with a deep respect for the natural world and the needs of communities. This means using technology to enhance sustainability, promote fairness, drive and competence, and foster a sense of collective purpose and responsibility. The motto therefore speaks to the transformative potential of technology and the belief that a better world is possible if we use it wisely. Cyberparadism offers a compelling vision of a future where humans and nature coexist in harmony, where technology is used to enhance rather than detract from the natural world, and where abundance and prosperity are available to all. As mentioned above, the Cyberparadism aesthetic is a vision of a technologically advanced future where society has achieved a utopian state of harmony and balance. The use of prefixes such as \"cyber-\" and \"neo-\" suggest a futuristic and innovative vision of this society, while the suffix \"-paradism\" and the word \"paradise\" evoke a sense of perfection and idealism reminiscent of the Golden Age in the Bible Genesis myth. The use of the word \"genesis\" suggests a beginning or origin, hinting at the idea of a new world being created through technology. The terms \"Eden\" and \"Elysian\" also convey a sense of a perfect and idyllic society, free from the flaws and imperfections of the present world. This is a non-exhaustive list of prefixes, suffixes and other attributes that are conveyed through Cyberparadism: Minimalism can also be seen as a hallmark of Cyberparadism. Technological sophistication can, if properly evolved, enable its enablers to do without unnecessary tools and machinery, therefore living with lesser things and interfaces. A continuation of technological sophistication induced minimalism is the prominent presence of either dramatic landscapes and/or lush nature. Unlike Cyberpunk or even Cyberprep, big cities and urban landscapes are not part of Cyberparadism. Societies tend to live in smaller, but highly sophisticated residentual buildings within wild and untamed nature. These residentual buildings can still be part of smaller aggregations and therefore form villages, but used space is usually kept to a minimum and travel distances to vast untouched landscapes are kept short. Visually spoken, Cyperparadism is an aesthetic that celebrates the beauty and power of nature while incorporating technological advancements in a way that promotes sustainability and simplicity. It offers a vision of a utopian society where humans and nature coexist in harmony, and where technology is used to enhance rather than detract from the natural world. In addition to its focus on sustainability and simplicity, Cyberparadism also values creativity and innovation. This is reflected in the subgenre's incorporation of advanced technologies such as terraforming and synthetic inception of life, which allow for the creation and preservation of new and endangered species. This emphasis on innovation and creativity is also reflected in the design of buildings and infrastructure, which often incorporate unique and imaginative features that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Cyberparadism is an aesthetic that celebrates the power of human ingenuity and the beauty of the natural world. It offers a compelling alternative to the dystopian visions of traditional cyberpunk, and presents a hopeful and inspiring vision of a future where technology and nature coexist in harmony. The Cyberparadism color palette is intended to reflect the subgenre's focus on nature, technology, and simplicity. The use of saturated greens and aquamarines is meant to evoke lush jungle environments, as well as the natural beauty of beaches and tropical landscapes. These colors also suggest a connection to the natural world and the importance of preserving and protecting it. The addition of cyan and silver adds a futuristic and technological element to the color palette, reflecting the subgenre's interest in advanced technologies such as mind-based and sensory interfaces, terraforming, and synthetic life. These colors also suggest a sense of precision and sophistication, which is echoed in the subgenre's use of highly sophisticated buildings in barren, untamed or lush landscapes. The choice of folly adds a vibrant and energetic element to the color palette, reflecting the subgenre's interest in hedonism and pleasure. This is balanced by the use of charcoal and white, which suggest a more minimal and understated approach to design and aesthetics. Overall, the Cyberparadism color palette is intended to evoke a sense of balance between the natural and the technological, the simple and the sophisticated, and the hedonistic and the minimalistic. The use of simple geometric shapes plays a vital role in the aesthetic, blending seamlessly with the lush, untamed natural landscapes. Spheres, cones, domes, pyramids, hexagons, and double-helix structures are commonly found throughout Cyberparadism environments, emphasizing harmony between the advanced technological constructs and the organic elements that surround them. These shapes, while minimalist and futuristic, are also reminiscent of structures found in nature, such as molecular structures, crystalline formations, or even the geometry of beehives. The integration of these simple geometric forms within the Cyberparadism aesthetic serves not only as a visual representation of the balance between the natural world and technological advancements but also as a functional design choice. These shapes lend themselves to efficient and sustainable building practices, often incorporating novel nanotech materials, self-sustaining energy sources, and advanced waste management systems. Their streamlined designs allow for easy adaptation to different environments, be it on Earth, exoplanets, or in other space frontier settings. The elements found within the Cyberparadism aesthetic share a core principle of harmoniously blending advanced technology with the natural world. These elements, whether they be architectural, communal, or transportation-focused, are designed to not only coexist with the environment but to actively enhance and preserve it. They embody a sustainable and symbiotic relationship, where human innovation is used to promote the well-being of both people and the planet. The successful integration of these elements relies on careful composition, ensuring that they complement rather than detract from the surrounding landscapes, ecosystems, and social structures. The composition of these elements is crucial in crafting the distinct feeling and vibes of the Cyberparadism aesthetic. By seamlessly merging natural and technological components, a sense of balance and harmony is achieved, evoking a vision of a utopian future where progress and preservation are not mutually exclusive. This composition fosters a sense of awe and inspiration, inviting its inhabitants to explore the limitless potential of human creativity while remaining grounded in their connection to the natural world. The Cyberparadism aesthetic emphasizes the importance of communal spaces and shared experiences, reinforcing the notion that the pursuit of higher goals and the betterment of society can be achieved collectively, rather than at the expense of individual fulfillment or the environment. In essence, the careful composition of these elements is paramount to conveying the core principles and unique atmosphere of Cyberparadism, where technology and nature coalesce to create a truly harmonious and sustainable future. The Cyberparadism aesthetic incorporates a variety of common design elements that blend advanced technology with natural and communal spaces, creating an environment that fosters harmony and well-being. Some common design elements include: In the Cyberparadism aesthetic, music features a fusion of ambient and futuristic sounds that evoke a sense of harmony, tranquility, and wonder. This distinctive soundscape would seamlessly blend organic and electronic elements, reflecting the balance between nature and technology that is central to the Cyberparadism philosophy. Upbeat ambient music would serve as the foundation, providing a soothing and immersive backdrop that invites listeners to explore the rich sonic landscape. Futuristic synths, with their ethereal and otherworldly qualities, would contribute to the overall atmosphere, adding depth and texture to the music. These synth sounds could range from warm, lush pads to sharp, crystalline arpeggios, evoking a sense of both familiarity and innovation. Ethereal drones and space-inspired soundscapes would further enhance the music, creating a sense of vastness and infinite possibility. These elements might include cosmic-inspired sound effects, such as distant echoes or pulsating frequencies, that transport listeners to the far reaches of the universe. In addition to these electronic components, organic and acoustic elements could be incorporated to reinforce the connection to nature. This might include the use of traditional instruments, such as flutes or stringed instruments, as well as field recordings of natural environments, like the rustling of leaves or the sound of flowing water. Percussion elements, such as gentle hand drums or shakers, could provide a subtle rhythmic foundation, fostering a sense of grounding and unity. While belonging to the broader class of futuristic aesthetics, Cyberparadism is best categorized as a subset of Post-Cyberpunk. It has a distinctly positive outlook in regards to emergence of science and technology. That optimism is shared by two other aesthetics, namely Cyberprep and Solarpunk. Main article: Cyberprep Cyberprep shares a lot of DNA with Cyberparadism. Both focus on the positive potential of technology. The main difference being the circumstance that Cyberprep is usually embedded in sprawling urban areas and cities in the same way contemporary urbanization is taking up vast spaces of land. By contrast, Cyberparadism infers a common understanding that land usage should be as efficient as possible and therefore is best left untouched. This is either achieved by having low demographics or dense architecture. For reference, some fictional works depict a resort of theme park where only a low amount of people can be kept to begin with. Other works showcase population control and/or cloning where the human impact in terms of land usage can be controlled accordingly. While large demographics are still envisageable within the context of Cyberparadism, the urban centers where people congregate are either kept out of nature high up in orbit (space stations or ships) or in large dense building monolithic in their shape and function. While not explicitly stated, unlike Cyberprep, Cyberparadism usually doesn't attribute any major importance to market economics as most resource management is ideally automatized and human labour kept to a minimum. Another key difference between Cyberparadism and Cyberprep is the subgenre's respective attitudes towards consumerism and materialism. Cyberprep often includes depictions of characters who are obsessed with the latest gadgets and technologies, and the genre often critiques the excesses of contemporary consumer culture. By contrast, Cyberparadism emphasizes a more minimalist and sustainable approach to living, where people focus on the things that truly matter rather than accumulating material possessions. Unlike conventional socialist utopias, while Cyberparadism does place a high value on sustainability, simplicity, and community, it is not necessarily incompatible with growth and innovation. In fact, one of the key principles of Cyberparadism is the responsible and thoughtful use of technology and scientific progress to enhance the human experience. Rather than rejecting growth and innovation outright, Cyberparadism emphasizes the importance of balancing these values with a respect for the natural world and the needs of communities. This can include the use of technology to enhance environmental conservation efforts, the creation of new and sustainable industries, and the development of innovative approaches to social and economic issues. Main article: Solarpunk Solarpunk is a cousin aesthetic of Cyberparadism. They both share a optimistic outlook on the future and the usage of science and technology. Both are motivated by post-scarcity and post-capitalism. Furthermore, like Solarpunk, Cyberparadism isn't nihilistic and tends to derive meaning from a higher-order mission such as the preservation of an extinct or valuable, yet alive species. The consideration for nature is also another element they both share. Where they diverge however is in their rendering of such a speculative future. Hierarchies are present in Cyperparadism. While individualism is respected, Cyberparadism tends to feature a sense of collectivism where the a higher-order goal of the collective is imperative. Also, while nature is being respected and preserved, Unlike Solarpunk, Cyberparadism doesn't allow itself to live in symbiosis with nature, but dominates it where it should be dominated and leaves it alone where it isn't necessary anymore. Another aspect very prominent in Solarpunk that is absent in Cyberparadism is the cooperative do-it-yourself spirit very reminiscent of medieval artisanry and craftsmanship that can be seen in many depictions of Solarpunk. Cyberparadism has all redundant and repetitive work automatized and heavily relies on technological entities to fulfill their duties. Also, another feature present in Solarpunk but not at all in Cyperparadism is artisanship and do-it-yourself elements. Conventionally, Solarpunk settings depict where resources are salvaged and recycled to extent the lifecycle of objects and human resources. Cyperparadism assumes a technological sophistication of a given society that has transcended the need to salvage and recycle materials, but makes use of more fundamental closed resources cycles where objects can be transmuted into more basic elements. Artisanships or craftsmanship, while possible in Cyperparadism, never takes the center stage and isn't a stylistic choice within the aesthetic. Another key difference between Solarpunk and Cyberparadism is their respective political and economic ideologies. Solarpunk is often associated with a quasi-socialist utopia, where communities work together to achieve a shared vision of the future. This can include the use of cooperatives, collective decision-making, and a more equal distribution of resources. By contrast, Cyberparadism places less emphasis on specific political or economic systems, and instead focuses on the positive use of technology, the ingenuity of the human species, and the preservation and cultivation of nature. Furthermore, while both Solarpunk and Cyberparadism value technology and scientific progress, they have different attitudes towards the role of the individual in society. In Solarpunk, there is often an emphasis on self-sufficiency and personal empowerment, with a focus on DIY culture and local community building. By contrast, Cyberparadism places more emphasis on the collective goals of society, and the importance of working together to achieve shared objectives, such as survival on an exoplanet or during the creation of a theme park with genetically engineered dinosaurs. To summarize, the following table lists all key differences between Cyberparadism and Solarpunk Cyberparadism in contemporary media tends to be a minor aesthetic and is typically embedded in a wider range of more prominent aesthetics and genres. A common plot element where Cyberparadism is being featured more prominently is the immersion in an allegedly utopian society where things transform themselves so that the utopian society at the outset can indeed be interpreted as dystopian. This is somewhat the case in Orion's Arm. The average sophont has very little control over the proceedings of the sphere in comparison to transapients, who are almost all smarter than even supergeniuses in the setting, with the exception of mentally ill transapients. However, living conditions are great for most in the Sphere. Also known as Franco-Belgian comics or simply as BD. Unfortunately, there aren't specific named examples of Cyberparadism in popular media, nor media titles specifically incorporating Cyberparadism as their main aesthetic. In most of the cases, Cyberparadism elements are present in the examples mentioned above but more often than not coupled with a dystopian overarching storyline that showcases the shortcoming of the initially benevolent elements of Cyberparadism, usually completely deconstructing the optimism, positive outlook and ultimately the potentiality of Cyberparadism to come to fruition. For this reason, the following list of potential ideas for media creators of all kinds (movie, games, TV shows) is going to feature hypothetical scenarios that might fit and fully incorporate the Cyberparadism aesthetic: Heimplanet is a German startup company from Hamburg that is specialized in outdoors and travel equipment. They started out with an innovative tent design. On their website, the following quote can be found: In the realm of Cyberparadism, where the fusion of nature's raw beauty and the pinnacle of technological advancements coexist, the sensory experience becomes paramount. The fragrances one chooses to wear in such a world are not just mere scents; they are an extension of the environment, a reflection of the balance between the paradisal and the cybernetic. Hermès H24, an Eau de Toilette, encapsulates the essence of Cyberparadism in a bottle. At its core, H24 is a modern fragrance, crafted with a nod to the future. Its innovative composition is a testament to the technological advancements in the world of perfumery. Yet, it doesn't lose touch with nature. The scent is fresh and green, reminiscent of untamed jungles and lush tropical landscapes. It's a fragrance that feels both advanced and organic, much like the Cyberparadism aesthetic itself. The notes within H24 are a journey through a world where nature and technology are in harmony. The initial burst of freshness, evoking the crispness of high-tech urban pods, gradually gives way to deeper, earthier undertones, reminiscent of the dense jungles and untouched terrains of Cyberparadism. It's a scent that tells a story of a world where the boundaries between the natural and the artificial blur, where one can experience the luxuries of advanced technology while being rooted in the beauty of the natural world. In the Cyberparadism lifestyle, where the pursuit of higher goals and a quasi-hedonistic existence is made possible by technology, the choice of fragrance becomes a statement. It's not just about smelling good; it's about aligning oneself with the world around them. Hermès H24 does just that. It's a fragrance that doesn't overpower but complements, making it the perfect choice for those who live in the balance of Cyberparadism. Cyperparadism is used as an aesthetic in a wide range of media, concept and fictional narratives. Some descriptions of these outlets is put together here, where the author or designer uses their own words to describe Cyperparadism without necessarily qualifying it as such. The first quote is from Coexis, a conceptual narrative imagined by Alex H.S. Lee: There are a number of real-world instances where the aesthethic of Cyberparadism matches either fully or at least partially. Some of these instances may or may not still be projected to be built in the future. The official Cyberparadism manifesto An excerpt from the beginning paragraphs of the manifesto: In the manifesto, a set of laws are being enumerated where each law highlights a core value of the Cyberparadism aesthetic: This is the first proposed flag draft for the Cyberparadism aesthetic. The flag's name is Abundance|Freedom|Progression and it was designed by user zarazinsfus.

Since society is largely leisure-driven, advanced body modifications are used for sports, pleasure and self-improvement. The word is an amalgam of the prefix \"cyber-,\" referring to cybernetics, and \"preppy,\" reflecting the aesthetic's clean look in common with clothes associated with being preppy. Cyberprep aesthetics apply the visuals often seen in Cyberpunk to a utopia, centering the positives of technological advancement.  A lot of Cyberprep aesthetics can carry similarities with both the Y2K Futurism and Frutiger family of aesthetics as well, due to the similarly utopian outlook those aesthetics have when it comes to the future. While cyberpunk fashion is inspired by counter-cultural outfits, cyberprep clothing draws on New Wave, Y2K Futurism aesthetic and contemporary fashion. In synth clubs, it's  very common for women to wear leather jackets and mini dresses that display their own brain patterns, while men wear Hussar jackets like Adam Ant. Walk down the street and you'll see women in shiny, chrome pantsuits and men wearing coats embedded with circuitry resembling artistic embroidery. Instead of metal or techno, cyberprep music is largely synthpop, electronic rock and Synthwave like Missing Persons, Electric Youth, and Lazerhawk. Instead of gyrating to techno in a warehouse or BDSM club, cyberpreps dance to synthpop in a night club with hologram light shows.

This became prominent in the 1980s. thanks to the works of authors like Philip K. Dick, Roger Zelazny, J. G. Ballard, Philip Jose Farmer, William Gibson and Harlan Ellison as they examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution while avoiding the utopian tendencies of earlier science fiction. Settings in the cyberpunk genre range from the richly (neon) colored, rough-around-the-edges urban jungles of Akira (1988), to the hyper-futuristic, neon cityscapes and bleak wastelands of Blade Runner 2049 (2017), with the first work in cyberpunk fiction being Katsuhiro Otomo's AKIRA manga (1982). William Gibson's Neuromancer (1984) novel has been credited as another defining magnum opus of the genre. Cyberpunk narratives often incorporate a sense of hopelessness or nihilism, typically featuring a gritty and violent backdrop, with crime, artificial intelligence, class uprising, governmental and corporate corruption, anarchy, gang warfare, and transhumanism all being central themes. The range is broad but the combination of these themes in the cyberpunk aesthetic is often used to convey deeper meanings and commentate on modern society and sometimes predictions of future society. Cyberpunk was likely the partial inspiration (or anti-inspiration) for Solarpunk - an aesthetic that also aspires to cast a glance into the future, but does so with a much less nihilistic perspective and played a role in inspiring Vaporwave since both seem to share a seeming disdain for mainstream capitalism, but Vaporwave is more sarcastic and mocking compared to Cyberpunk, which is more open with its disdain for the corporate dystopia. In truth, most online aesthetics almost completely owe their entire existence to Cyberpunk and its rebelliousness to the status quo of the 1980s; everything from the Steampunk and Dieselpunk of yesteryear to any sort of micro-genres that will pop up in the future. Transhumanism is an international political movement that advocates for the transformation of the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology.  This very philosophy has very close ties to the Cyberpunk aesthetic in that, what's more Cyberpunk than becoming part human/part machine?  There have also been numerous examples of protagonists in Cyberpunk fiction that are transhuman in their own right (most famously, Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell is an example of Transhumanism in Cyberpunk). Cyberpunk media discusses the morals of this philosophy and how it could blur the lines between human and machine and invoke potential ethical and social inequalities. Cybersecurity (also known as information security or infosec), is the practice of protecting computer systems and data from security hackers, cybercriminals, spies, or other bad actors.[1] \"Hackers\" are now generally understood to be bad actors, but hacker culture reclaims the label for people who see programming and computer systems as a medium of freedom and creativity.[2] The \"high tech, low life\" nature of cybersecurity is often reflected in the offensive and defensive security operatives of cyberpunk fiction and media. In Neuromancer, the protagonist Henry Case is a security hacker working to penetrate corporate computer networks. In Ghost in the Shell, Motoko Kusanagi is referred to as a hacker as short hand for her programming ability which she uses to investigate and prevent cybercrime. Many characters in cyberpunk fiction and media embody hacker culture and the hacker ethic, which asserts that all information should be free.[3] The protagonists of The Matrix embody the late 1990s self-image of hackers attempting to free humanity from corporate dominiation of technology.[4] Today, many advocates and users of free and open source software adopt a cyberpunk aesthetic, as demonstrated by the r/unixporn subreddit. The Cyberpunk community has a strong interest in privacy and cybersecurity.[5] Members of the community advocate improving personal privacy and security by using tools like open-source operating systems, secure browsers and VPNs.[6] Main Article: Techwear Cyberpunk fashion is heavily influenced by films like Johnny Mnemonic, Blade Runner, and The Matrix and could be interpreted as being \"futuristic gothic fashion\" and involves trench coats, boots, shiny black clothing, colored \"dreads\" that women might wear, etc. Although, Techwear is not the only notable fashion influence when it comes to Cyberpunk. Warcore and Darkwear also heavily inspire the idea of Cyberpunk fashion. Warcore takes war-like / associated motifs like utility vests, cargo pants, and maximalism in its abundance of buckles, straps, and other utility accessories. Darkwear on the other hand is more minimalistic. Darkwear takes streetwear silhouettes and flips them into darker, usually monochrome, pieces and outfits. It's similar to Warcore, but as if you've taken away the maximalism aspect. While every brand listed may not be dedicated to one aesthetic, each brand has a notable amount of products that can be incorporated into Techwear, Warcore, and Darkwear, which are often associated with the cyberpunk aesthetic as a whole. These are also only bigger brands. Platforms like Etsy and Depop are great for finding pieces that match this aesthetic with just a quick search. Cyberpunk has been very influential to film and television, inspiring the aesthetics of movies, television shows, and anime. There just seems to be something encoded into the DNA of cyberpunk that makes it incredibly compatible with a lot of future-themed speculative media, even that aimed for children (an argument could even be made that the Sonic SatAM series from the '90s is something of an example of cyberpunk since it involves a group of freedom fighters fighting back an oppressive technologically-based regime run by Dr. Robotnik). The cyberpunk genre has spurred the creation of various cyberpunk-themed video games such as Cloudpunk, Va-11 Hall-A, and most notably Cyberpunk 2077. While Cyberpunk itself is not a genre of music (nor does it have one genre associated with it), there are some characteristics of music that tend to make it sound Cyberpunk. These characteristics include the use of synthesizers, Cyberpunk themes, and sounding dark without being Darkwave. Synthwave and Synthpop music tends to sound Cyberpunk.[7] It can be argued that many futuristically influenced 80s synthpop and New Romantic bands influenced the music and aesthetic of what would later be dubbed Cyberpunk. Gary Numan, whose music was heavily inspired by the work of Phillip K. Dick, was one of the major purveyors of this early iteration of the genre. His album Replicas is a perfect example of what Cyberpunk should sound like. Cyberpunk podcasts include podcasts that are related to cyberpunk interests, including science, technology, privacy, and cybersecurity. Biopunk is a subgenre of Cyberpunk that focuses on biotechnology. For more information, see Biopunk. Bronzepunk takes Greco-Roman aesthetics and puts them into a pseudo-modern world. The name comes from the use of bronze-age technology, albiet with modern twists. For more information, see Sandalpunk. Clockpunk takes elements of Cyberpunk and puts them into a Renaissance setting. Some call it steampunk without the steam.[8] For more information, see Clockpunk. Ironpunk adds traits of Cyberpunk to an Iron Age setting. Nowpunk essentially says that Cyberpunk is now. Bruce Sterling used it to describe his 2005 novel, titled The Zenith Angle. Solarpunk is the opposite of cyberpunk. It features an optimistic view of the future, emphasizing renewable energy, handcrafted wares, and anti-capitalism. For more information, see Solarpunk. Lunarpunk is closely related to Solarpunk with its emphasis on nature and renewable energy, with an addition of witchcraft. For more information, see Lunarpunk. Afrofuturism takes element from african culture and traditions and incomporate sci-fi elements. For more information, see  Afrofuturism. Tupinipunk refers to the Brazilian sci-fi/cyberpunk movement. This is a criticism of the Euro-centric and US-centric views that tend to dominate Cyperpunk. For more information, see Tupinipunk. Cyberpunk often incorporates elements of Asian culture, particularly from Japan and Hong Kong, into its visual and narrative motifs. Critics argue that this can sometimes result in a shallow and appropriative portrayal of Asian cultures, reducing them to exotic and fetishized stereotypes. Cyberpunk often portrays technology as the driving force shaping society, sometimes overlooking the complex interplay between technology, politics, and social dynamics. Critics argue that this deterministic perspective can oversimplify the complexities of societal change and overlook other factors influencing the future.

It is characterized by skeuomorphism, kid-friendly interfaces, common setting of malls, schools, streets, low-poly 3D models and in general, the online worlds they take place in. Further read: [2][3] The first virtual worlds came in the form of chat rooms where the world was described exclusively through text, and this notably included MUDs (multi-user dimension/dungeon) or MUSHs, the later abbreviation being disputed  The first MUD was created in 1978 by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle at Essex University. [4][5] Neopets was created by then college students Donna Williams and Adam Powell, and launched in 1999 as the first big browser-based virtual pet site which developed into a fully fledged virtual world with social aspects such as the ability to customize profiles and message boards.[6] The popularity of Neopets spawned several virtual pet sites which range in being more heavily based on Neopets, such as Marapets and Subeta both created in 2004. Virtual pet sites as a genre has since expanded to include a variety of unique games with some being focused on the creature collecting like Chicken Smoothie or some being based on the simulation aspects like Lioden. Webkinz got its start in 2005 as one of the first big toys to life games where players would adopt a stuffed animal with a code that would grant them access to the online game.[7] Its success would spawn other browser-based toys to like games, such as U.B. Funkeys in 2007.",

The aesthetic has to do with shared traits amongst villains in cartoons that have a cybernetic or science fiction motif in the story. These villains typically are armored, employ technologically advanced weapons, and have aspirations to create/maintain an empire and/or commit some form of genocide. The name \"Cybervillain\" originates from how most villains of this type were based on cybernetic technology (ex. Megabyte from ReBoot, Swayzak from Toonami). Elements of cybervillain were deviated from Jonny Quest, toy cartoons of the '80s and '90s, and Japanese anime/tokusatsu. Some other factors were '50s B-movies, like the Flash Gordon serials, and the '90s \"X-TREME\" movement. Fantastic Four nemesis Doctor Doom in particular was a precursor to the aesthetic, as he had a lack of mouth, glowing red eyes, and was the ruler of Latveria. In the late '70s, Star Wars introduced Darth Vader, an armoured villain and the ruler of an evil empire. The movie's popularity caused Vader's motif to be copied in various media, including the Pac-Man cartoon with Mezmaron. Some other early examples would be Dr Claw from Inspector Gadget, as even if he wasn’t shown on-screen, his mannerisms shot him right into this territory, and Megatron from The Transformers. ReBoot in 1994 debuted villains Megabyte and Hexadecimal, who were one of the first modern villains of this aesthetic. In 1996, Superman: The Animated Series introduced a new take on longtime DC villain Brainiac, presenting him as an evil Kryptonian AI destroying planets for their knowledge. His Raygun Gothic design combined with this goal made him another fledgling example; and albeit not sci-fi in nature, one-time villain Karkull was, too. Although they were live action, Batman Forever and Batman & Robin in the mid-late '90s had some traits that would later show up in Cybervillain culture, especially the latter with Mr. Freeze. In 1998, Gex: Enter the Gecko was released for the PlayStation, containing Rez, a cybernetic entity with a deep voice and an angular design. Although not as notable as other examples, he could very well count as an early example of this aesthetic; however, while most villains of this type had vented mouths, he had sharp teeth instead. In 1999, Toy Story 2 was released, featuring Emperor Zurg, a villain from the in-universe Buzz Lightyear series. He practically defined the cybervillain aesthetic, with his sharp, angular edges, his deep voice, his vented mouth, and his thin waist. Zurg later appeared in the Buzz Lightyear of Star Command TV cartoon the following year, with another notable example, NOS-4-A2. In 2001, Samurai Jack premiered on Cartoon Network, introducing Aku, a villain with an angular design and a thin waist. Following Samurai Jack, many villains of other shows started copying this aesthetic, even CGI cartoons, as Swayzak from Toonami's Trapped in Hyperspace event proved. Swayzak was meant to be a homage to Megabyte, but his appearance and personality was closer to that of Zurg, even pulling off the same motions Zurg does in the video game scene from Toy Story 2 when he first appears. Online, he had a strange quirk none of the previous examples had: a New Zealander accent. Danny Phantom and The Fairly OddParents introduced a switch-up to the design: Vlad Plasmius and Dark Laser were designed with a more traditional curved chest design, as opposed to the previous villains' straight line chests. This was the same with Loki from Cartoon Network's The Life and Times of Juniper Lee. In 2010, DreamWorks Animation released Megamind, which was the last major production to contain the cybervillain aesthetic. Like Megabyte, Zurg, and Swayzak, Megamind was a CGI example. Cybervillain has showed up again very rarely throughout the early to mid-2010s, mostly in Disney cartoons like Motorcity and Tron Uprising. By the late '10s, cybervillain was really only used as a parody in lowbrow kids media, including Betrayus from Pac-Man and The Ghostly Adventures. More recent cybervillain examples from shows that usually don't have the aesthetic are Lord Hater and Lord Dominator from Wander Over Yonder, as well as Hoodoo Guru from SpongeBob SquarePants (especially his disguised form). Lightyear in 2022 revamped Zurg for a new generation, possibly hinting at a resurgence of the aesthetic. The cybervillain aesthetic could also be found in theme parks. Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin at Walt Disney World was the first appearance of Zurg, the ride debuting a year before Toy Story 2. He even had a voice calling back to Dr Claw, done by his original character designer, Ken Mitchroney. A year later, Doctor Doom's Fearfall opened with Universal's Islands of Adventure, containing a very cybervillain take on Doctor Doom, voiced by Floridian comedian Freddy Stebbins. Robots of Mars, a simulator ride at Geauga Lake and Six Flags Over Texas, contained the Supervisor of Mars, who looked similar to Swayzak in design, and had a motif like Unicron. A later theme park example was Reese's Cupfusion at Hersheypark, made during the Dark Era, as it had Mint the Merciless, a lowbrow parody of earlier characters such as Ming the Merciless. Lego's Bionicle and Hero Factory lines also contained some very cybervillain characters. The board game The Omega Virus, released by Milton-Bradley in late 1992, contained a very early example of cybervillain with its computer virus antagonist that had glowing red eyes, a vented mouth, and a love of taunting the Battlesat-1 computer.",

Because this is an internet aesthetic, it largely entails sharing photographs, making outfits, and participating in certain hobbies through social media. As the internet aesthetic grew in the late 2010s and early 2020s, many book publishers capitalized on this aesthetic and used this phrase to create and advertise YA books, making this also a new fictional microgenre in its early stages. Dark Academia's visuals stem primarily from upper-class European cultures of the 19th century, Gothicism, and American Prep. The upper class of this time period emphasized a liberal education in which Latin, rhetoric, and classics were taught subjects. These are now seen as unusual and esoteric, creating an allure that presents schooling as not dreary or boring, but one that cultivates mystery, curiosity, and diligence that isn't commonly seen in contemporary schooling. Because of this allure of intelligence and mystery, being pretentious is celebrated within the Dark Academia community. Romanticizing education and moments in life related to university experiences is the core appeal of the aesthetic, with grandiose statements and wishes for success being common text post subjects. Other than the appreciation of learning, Dark Academia includes motifs of criminality and danger. Secret societies, cults and murder are common subjects within the aesthetic. Characters within the works of fiction associated with Dark Academia, specifically The Secret History and Kill Your Darlings, live decadent and self-destructive lifestyles involving drugs, moments of intense violence, and secrets. People who use this aesthetic are sometimes referred to as Dark Academics. However, \"academic\" typically refers to researchers and professors, while Dark Academia fans do not usually have recognized credentials or an academic background. Dedicated fans of the aesthetic may craft a persona based on the characters and suggestions of the aesthetic, often pursuing an academic career, though of course, such personae don't reflect the actual career and environment of academia. It is important to note that in multiple ways, Dark Academia is not new. Rather, it is a continuation of different pre-existing aesthetics that had a basis in artistic periods, literature and mannerisms surrounding the upper class. The Dark Academia aesthetic referred to in this article is within the context of mid-late 2010s-early 2020s internet culture wherein users, largely teenagers, discuss the contents of the page online. This phenomenon is largely confined to social media, such as tumblr, Instagram and Tiktok. The largest and most notable influence on the aesthetic is the ideas and lifestyles of Romantic-era nobles and intellectuals such as Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley and Edmund Burke. The cohort was known for writing poetry and prose of great beauty while living languid and privileged lives. Their works emphasized emotion, imagination, and the historical. Much of their poetry, art, and prose is posted on social media sites. The later Aesthetic and Decadent movement, headed by Oscar Wilde, lends the \"dandy\" aspects of the internet aesthetic. Having unique personality traits, turns of phrase, manners of dress, interior design, etc. were valued in this milieu, which can be seen in the novels that the Dark Academia aesthetic based itself on. As history progressed, many ideas on the fashion, stereotypes, and personalities of academic types developed. The major influences came from the prestigious universities of Oxford and Cambridge in Britain, and the Ivy League universities in the United States. These universities heavily favored students who attended private schools, and as mentioned in the introduction, grammar schools with a classical education. Their connotations remained relatively the same throughout history, with an emphasis on professionalism, intellectualism, and Old Money origins. In the 1950s, Preppy fashion became codified. The New England upper-middle class of this time had fashion trends amongst themselves that grew in the environment of Ivy League universities. The students there favored fashion styles that are still associated with academics, and thus Dark Academia to this day. See the Fashion section below for more specific details. Later, the literary Beat Generation (stereotyped as Beatnik) movement that also came up in the late 60s also placed a large emphasis on knowledge, art, and poetry. The dark clothes, drug-use, and spiritual experimentation are some aspects that influenced the modern image of intellectuals, and thus Dark Academia. Actual historical monuments and imagery of poets (for example, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Rimbaud, and Edith Sitwell) and artists began to be used. Some historical figures during this time, such as Allen Ginsberg, feature in the film Kill Your Darlings, one of the Dark Academia \"classics.\" All of these historic periods were reflected in Donna Tartt's The Secret History. The sublime, picturesque and beautiful are concepts frequently repeated by the narrator, Richard Papen; the main characters vacation in a remote mansion and get drunk, discuss intellectually stimulating topics and lived decadently, like the Romantic poets did in their famed Geneva trip; and the ritual for Bacchanal is a representation of the same fascination with the irrational. Appreciation for Donna Tartt herself comes from the Esquire article \"The Secret Oral History of Bennington: The 1980s' Most Decadent College,\" which describes \"the baroque wickedness, the malignant glamour, the corruption so profound as to be exactly what is meant by the word decadence.\"[1] This cements the connection of Donna Tartt and her alma mater to the precedents. Additionally, her androgyny, close friendships and rock-and-roll lifestyle are admired by the Dark Academic audience; Tumblr blogs would share screenshots and text quotes from the article to feature on their blogs.[2] Its publication of 2019 also links this article to the rise in popularity c. 2020. The tag \"Dark Academia\" originated sometime around 2015 on tumblr and had a relatively smaller reach and referred to the main work that started the aesthetic: The Secret History.[3]The aesthetic resembled a book club more than a true aesthetic and users largely communicated through asks and reblogs to discuss the work itself, with less of an influence placed on fashion and lifestyle. Similar with other fandoms, the The Secret History fandom produced moodboards; however, they did not resemble the typical Dark Academia aesthetic, instead taking on a more minimalist look with photographic emphasis on symbols relating to characters, typography and fancasts.[4] Multiple other fandoms also contributed to the development. Many of the visuals came from the Harry Potter series, which was popular at the time; the films' set (largely from Oxford University), whimsy surrounding studying, leather-bound books and mystery are clear links to the Dark Academia aesthetic. Many of these blogs also reblogged content from art history-centered tumblrs, which posted photos of architecture and paintings in the movements described in the visuals section. As bloggers discussed the media that has come to be associated with Dark Academia and multiple people posted art history content, the community formed and the name was created. The name was popularized through 2017-2018 through a number of different text posts on tumblr; user holocene-days listed the three canonical Dark Academia films and books, saying, \"the holy trinity of Dark Academia that is kill your darlings, dead poets society, and the secret history.\"[5] The aesthetic evolved over time from an aesthetic that had a small community, was learned through osmosis and focused specifically on the media into what it was today. Dark Academia evolved in ways that the aesthetic was communicated; character collages became popular as people more in tune with online aesthetic culture, specifically Studyblr, and the aesthetic became codified through different social media. In spreading to different audiences, the aesthetic became something more aspirational and lifestyle-oriented, with guides and recommendations instead of purely visuals to look at. These different posts are also responsible for creating new \"Academia aesthetics.\" Playing on the adjective \"dark,\" people take that part off and substitute it for other adjectives that would mesh well with their idea of a picturesque Academia-themed aesthetic, such as Romantic Academia, Light Academia, etc. After the Tumblr community gained popularity, TikTok caught on. Because of the more visual qualities of the app, greater emphasis was placed on the fashion, interior design, etc. Because TikTok requires music over the videos, users found songs that have now become ubiquitous in the community. On June 30th, 2020, The New York Times published an article entitled \"Academia Lives — on TikTok,\" making Dark Academia, and the aesthetic community in general, known to an audience typically separate from online youth culture.[6] Now, after the publication of these articles and the availability of information, \"Dark Academia\" is used by book publishers to commission and advertise books in the Young Adult genre that takes place in the setting. Bookstores often feature table displays or blogposts recommending books that are similar to The Secret History. Romanticizing the university experience and appreciating the environments and activities associated with Dark Academia is the most common motif. Romanticizing is the act of creating an ideal image of something, with seeing the subject as romantic, beautiful, and significant, especially when the subject is mundane. In this aesthetic, appreciators look to studying and gaining knowledge as the thing to idealize. The learning is done for learning's sake, rather than using an education as a means of gaining employment, good grades (which is still strived for, but not the main goal), or doing it out of a sense of obligation. Studying is done for the enjoyment of it, both in connection to the subject itself, but also as a picturesque thing for a person to do. As discussed in the visuals section, note-taking and existing in spaces for studying looks pleasing to these people. In fact, many people join Dark Academia to motivate themselves in their schoolwork. Specifically, the community enjoys the emotional connection to their subject of study. This is almost always the humanities (literature, history, philosophy, etc.) and languages, as opposed to STEM or artistic creation, which are celebrated in Science Academia, Theatre Academia, Art Academia, etc., off-shoots created specifically for these different subjects. Specifically, the humanities are insights into the purpose and nature of human society. There is a strong emphasis on appreciation of poetry, prose, and art history in an intuitive fondness for its beauty. There is also an extreme to this, where Dark Academics desire the feeling of academic overwork, such as in not getting enough sleep, obsessive thoughts, and striving for academic knowledge above all other areas in life. Building off of this, contrasting from the pure Apollonian intellect of academia is the desire for Dionysian ecstasy, irrationality, and lust. These motifs specifically originated from The Secret History by Donna Tartt, which is expanded in the history section. In the community, there is the desire to encounter altered states of consciousness, which reveal \"purer\" and more intense emotions and losses of control. The way this is shown is largely through reblogged quotes from literature and jokes about reaching this state of being. Dark Academics also have an appreciation for the past, specifically eras such as the Classical, Romantic, Victorian, and Roaring 20s. Bloggers often write about wishing for the manners, education, and romanticism of these past eras to return. For example, a poster might lament about the death of love letters, architecture that is grandiose, and kissing hands as a greeting. Note that the intent is to return to the romantic practices that are now considered outdated; people in the aesthetic are not concerned with being historically accurate in dress, slang, or have a political motivation to return to the past. Another one of the main appeals of Dark Academia is intrigue that comes with being in a cohort of intellectuals. In the works of fiction that are thought to be the Dark Academia \"canon,\" (The Secret History, If We Were Villains, The Dead Poets Society) there is always a clique of students that share a common passion for their subject.  The appreciators of Dark Academia enjoy the close bonds of a group of friends- but one that transcends the typical thought of casual, pleasure-based friends and into something more profound and intimate. Queer love is often seen in this aesthetic community. Many users admire literary characters and intellectuals who were queer, such as Achilles and Patroclus, Sappho, Oscar Wilde, and Virginia Woolf. This builds off on the appreciation for the humanities as a way to create connections across time, but through a community that is often neglected in history. This aesthetic also provides an outlet for people who do not fit into the stereotypical queer culture of Camp, alternative fashion, and overt sexuality by expressing an aesthetic more associated with introversion while still being queer-coded to those who are online. And within Dark Academic books, many characters are either openly or hinted to be queer or develop homoerotic relationships. This emphasis on romance is a product of the \"tenderness\" and \"yearning\" culture on tumblr during 2019, which uplifts romantic love, both requited and unrequited, as well as old-fashioned symbols of courtship such as through letters and artistic inspiration, especially between queer people during history. However, negative emotions and drama within these platonic and romantic relationships are also important. The characters from the above works have their own judgments on the other members in their clique and their actions, often developing alliances, toxic romances and sexual relationships, a clear leader, and an ostracized member. In the works of fiction, the murder/other crime leads the friend group to develop tension where betrayal and loyalty becomes life-or-death (see the Media section for more details.) Of course, it is not exactly clear if people do pursue the negative aspects of cliques in real life, but multiple text posts celebrate the characters in the novels (see Criticism.) Dark Academia as a whole utilizes the colors black, beige, dark brown, forest green, dark orange, cream, gold and burgundy. The photographs tend to be dimly lit, as to give the appearance of illumination through only candlelight, a sun-less day, or light being unable to reach the interiors of a deep, alcove-filled room. As such, chiaroscuro and tenebrism, the contrast between light and dark, is a common motif within images and outfits. White statues in the dark, pale skin (see Eurocentrism) contrasting dark clothing, and the art movements described below are examples of this style. Often, photo editing is employed to increase the shadows of the image. Gothic, Neoclassical, Gothic Revival and Beaux-Arts architecture is featured frequently in Dark Academic images, as most of the prestigious campuses, museums and libraries were built in this style. Other common buildings are Baroque palaces that evoke masked balls (overlapping with Dark Royalcore), English manor houses and Victorian streets. Red brick, rusticated stone, wrought iron fencing, Gothic arches, mahogany paneling, classical columns and generous ornamentation are common traits shared among these spaces. Some of the most common buildings reblogged are the campuses of Harvard, Oxford and Cambridge; the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum; the Gloucester Cathedral; and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The artworks used in Dark Academia come from the periods typically associated with European civilization: Renaissance, Baroque, Dutch Golden Age, Neoclassical, Academic, Romantic, Realist, Aesthetic and Pre-Raphaelite periods are the paintings that are the most commonly reblogged, with subjects such as architecture, landscapes, anatomical studies, vanitas, Christian and Classical mythology, and portraiture of people wearing austere clothing. Etchings are incredibly common, as well as illustration and sketching. These have a benefit of having literary subjects, as these were often accompaniments to books. Sculpture is always done in white marble and Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical. Technique, such as in the illusion of flesh, psychological presence, diaphanous fabric, and drapery, is admired. Because this is a lifestyle aesthetic, many people also apply Dark Academia to their interior design (mostly bedrooms because teens are the majority users.) People would most often have gallery walls where they collect postcards and prints of the artwork styles above, have wooden vintage furniture, light candles, and have more intimate lighting. These spaces are often cluttered. The romanticization of studying, journaling and letter-writing is demonstrated through appreciation for calligraphy and stationery. Fountain pens and typewriters are proudly displayed and users would often take images of the results of their notebook entries, not unlike Studyblr. However, their writing is cursive and decorations are sparse. Images associated with literature are another common photo subject. Antique books, screenshots of e-books with highlighted lines, annotations, and typography are common. Latin, ancient Greek, English and French are popular in Dark Academia both as subjects of linguistic study and in aesthetic images of text. In the spring of 2021, a trend on tumblr which arose was the use of \"comparatives/parallels/web-weaving,\" which are short compilations of 5-10 quotes and/or images from poetry, literature, art, movies, etc. that center around one motif such as \"the kitchen table\" and \"women and horror.\" Note that this type of post is not exclusive to Dark Academia and is more aligned with fans of literature in general. Nature may make an appearance in the aesthetic, mostly in the form of British moors, autumnal forests and occasional images of seaside cliffs. Dreary weather, such as fog or rain, enhances the gloomy nature of this aesthetic. This further adds to the romanticism of sneaking into the forest to do pagan rituals, as well as creating a connection to the poetry of the American Romantics. The influence of the Picturesque and the Sublime, as outlined in the work of Edmund Burke, is another aspect of this. This can overlap with an autumn Cottagecore blended aesthetic or Green Academia. Boarding school imagery, such as school uniforms, living in a dormitory, and running away, is more common in more youthful and playful interpretations of the aesthetic. Here, the sense of mystery, danger and kinship are enhanced, while the connotations of professionalism and sophistication are lessened. Café society is also another influence on the aesthetic. Coffee shops are associated with both the flaneurs of 19th-century Paris and the contemporary stressed college students of today. As such, that space is romanticized and images of coffee, people-watching, and studying within the space is popular. Violent imagery addresses the \"dark\" moniker. Like in the novels and films, murder and death are popular subjects. This is displayed through murder weapons that are also aesthetically pleasing, such as vials of poison, ornate daggers and even occasional images of guns. Blood, such as on clothing or on white statues (which suggests the bashing of someone's head) is another example. Graveyards are also another location that is commonly reblogged due to the connotations with Gothic literature and memento mori. As mentioned, self-destructive habits are also portrayed in the aesthetic, and in visuals, this tends to manifest in smoking tobacco, which also was a very common thing to do in the past and still has some connotations of mystery and glamour. Other drugs and alcohol are in books, but are less common in photographs. For the purposes of citation, as well as a way to view inspiration, here is a link to the Wayback Machine's snapshots of the Dark Academia tag on tumblr. Dark Academia is an aesthetic that was created and maintained online, meaning that the community expresses and shares content over social media. The type of posts created and shared largely changes per platform, and the aesthetic evolves differently. Here are some common tumblr Dark Academia post formats. Fashion-specific Tiktoks may include: Many Booktok creators/video makers cross over into Dark Academia and have the aesthetic while making Booktok content such as book recommendations, memes, etc. Themed playlists where the creator compiles various classical music pieces into one video with an appropriate image. Occasionally, some videos include rain and/or library ambiance. These are by far the most popular Dark Academia-oriented content on this platform, as many non-Dark Academia fans enjoy these videos. Character moodboards, which are outfits accompanying small bullet-pointed lists about the habits, quirks, and personality types of imagined characters fitting the aesthetic Dark Academia fashion emphasizes a high-class and vintage form of dress which is an amalgamation of different historical periods. The main inspiration for Dark Academic fashion comes from American Prep, such as sweater vests or sweaters worn tied over the shoulders. This itself came from 1940s prep school uniforms, as seen in blazers, pleated skirts and regimental striped ties. Stereotypes surrounding humanities professors also influenced the fashion. Tweed blazers with elbow patches are one of the \"essentials\" of a Dark Academic wardrobe, as explained here. Elements of the Victorian and Romantic fashion influence the more fanciful interpretation of the style, creating the look of a Gothic novel character or of an eccentric dandy. Autumnal fashion is also highly influential, as the associations with back-to-school clothing and bookishness are very connotative to the aesthetic. The most prestigious universities which this aesthetic centers on, such as those in the United Kingdom and New England in the United States, are in cooler climates, which is another reason why the fashion is autumnal. One of the appeals of a Dark Academia wardrobe is the versatility of the pieces, as many of them could be mixed and matched. Like with school uniforms, this allows students/academics to not have to concern themselves too much with choosing their outfits in the day.[7] Additionally, all of these clothes are commonly seen in a variety of stores, from thrift shops to in-person malls to designer brands. Searching for garments is thus easier, as it can fit multiple budgets and locales, as opposed to styles that have more specialized and alternative pieces that would be hard to find. Usual fabric choices are more upscale, like cashmere, wool and tweed, but linen and cotton are also very common. Patterns are minimal, with plaids and argyle being the most common. The shirts worn by Dark Academics can be masculine, such as with professional button-ups, or more feminine with ornate blouses that include details such as lace, puffed sleeves, and ruffles. Collars are incredibly important to the look, and they often are either layered under sweaters or used as a statement, such as in sailor-style shirts. Sweaters are also important and contribute to the autumnal and bookish character of the wearer. Turtlenecks make the look sexier and more sophisticated, and sweaters provide an opportunity to add texture to an outfit in the form of cable-knit and embroidery. Sweater vests also add an opportunity to layer. Pants in the Dark Academia aesthetic are always formal dress pants. They typically are in a sturdier material, such as tweed, and would sometimes feature patterns such as check and herringbone. Pleats are a common detail, and the fit around the ankles (flare, tapered, or straight) is up to personal preference. Skirts are also featured in more feminine outfits. Pleated and/or check-patterned skirts allude to prep school uniforms; mid-length or long flowing skirts have a more elegant, even Victorian feel; and straight pencil skirts, often with button details, make the look more mature and reference the 1930s-1940s. Dresses are often worn as layering pieces. Pinafores and sleeveless dresses are often worn under turtlenecks or collared shirts. These can include the same details as skirts, and are more basic for the sake of layering, rather than as a statement. However, interpretations of Dark Academia that include Royalcore can include romantic ballgowns, and Cottagecore interpretations with Medieval-inspired milkmaid dresses. Outerwear is the most prominent feature of Dark Academic fashion because blazers, cardigans, and different kinds of coats are the most evocative of sophistication and professionalism. Outerwear is also extremely autumnal and an important feature of historical and vintage fashion in general. The details in outerwear add texture and structure to an outfit. The fabrics used here are incredibly important and tends to be of high-quality wool tweed. The fit of the outer layer is incredibly important because it makes the silhouette. In the community, it is largely either tailored to the wearer's body to look clean and professional or oversized to have a more cozy or chic look. The type of outerwear worn with an outfit can greatly change the connotations and style associated with it. Like sweaters, cardigans can add texture and tends to be a softer and more casual interpretation of the aesthetic (especially if over-sized). Meanwhile, long coats, especially in black, add intimidating drama. Blazers, typically associated with men's businesswear, are the most common type of outerwear. The sweater/cardigan can also be tied over shoulders to mimic the advertisements for American Prep brands. The shoes tend to be leather men's dress shoes such as brogues and wing-tips. These match the timelessness and professionalism of the aesthetic and match the understated neutrality of the other formal pieces. However, Doc Marten's black boots may be worn to add an edginess to the outfit. This brand is actually trending across many aesthetics throughout youth fashion in the 2020s, and its utilitarian nature makes it avoid looking incongruous to the rest of the clothing. In more feminine outfits, Mary-Janes or Victorian-esque footwear such as boots could be worn. These are typically matched with long socks to match other prep-school styled pieces such as pleated skirts. Dark Academia tends to feature gender-neutral leather vintage and rectangular bags (mostly messenger bags). These match the professional aesthetic of formal outerwear and the utilitarian, no-frills versatility of the rest of the wardrobe. However, tote bags with an art print could be used for a more casual look while still fitting in with the aesthetic. Accessories that accompany suiting such as ties, pocket squares, and cufflinks are common. These should follow the same elegant and minimal aesthetic and fit the color palette. Unlike in some other outfits, such as in certain magazine editorials, these accessories aren't meant to stand out and add splashes of color that make it look daring. Leather belts are an extremely popular component in Dark Academia outfits. It connects to vintage fashion, as this was generally worn throughout history, but lessened in popularity in more contemporary times as fashion became more casual. Likewise, suspenders have the same vintage connotation, but aren't as common in Dark Academia because of the popularity of sweaters. Glasses match the aesthetic because of its association with bookishness. These have classic and mature styles, such as in wire, dark metal, or tortoise-shell frames. More feminine outfits can feature jewelry, but this is understated and timeless, with simple gold and silver. Solid silver or gold pendants are especially common when worn with turtlenecks. Brooches are a common piece to add character flare to an outfit and are often cameos, skulls, insects, and other vintage things associated with the visuals. Rings, however, are an opportunity for exploring maximalism because many people stack different ring styles on top of each other. The hairstyles associated with the aesthetic are fairly loose in that multiple styles can fit, from neat bobs to long and disheveled. However, it is noted that alternative hairstyles, such as buzzed hair or hair dyed in unnatural colors, tend to be left out from the aesthetic because of its incongruity with the vintage aesthetic. The makeup associated with Dark Academia should be either minimal and natural or mysterious, almost femme fatale-like. Natural (or no) makeup is associated with the more utilitarian and masculine forms of dress. The more obvious makeup follows the color palette of Dark Academia with burgundy lipstick and eyeshadow in grays and neutrals. Some common trends of contemporary makeup (heavy winged eyeliner, shimmer, contouring, etc.) tend to look mismatched to the more vintage type of fashion in the aesthetic and aren't used. Likewise, nails should be kept short and natural, but can be painted in neutral and dark colors and without too much ornamentation such as sparkles. Dark Academia media tends to fall into two types: the first is media that is established as classic, also known as part of \"the canon,\" meaning that the work is considered by academics to have artistic merit and is worthy of academic study. These books tend to be from the Classical Era (such as the plays of Sophocles, philosophical theory, etc.) and Western literature up to the mid 20th century. Literature such as this does not include Dark Academia tropes but are considered Dark Academia because it has the same associations with intelligence, refinement and would be studied in the setting. Note that what is classified as high literature is connected to critiques of Eurocentrism. For more information and a list of examples of books included, see Western Canon on Wikipedia. The second group is media that is not studied by academic professionals and may often be \"pop\" literature, which means it primarily seeks to entertain instead of creating a philosophical dialogue. They are included here for having visuals and tropes that match the aesthetic. What is considered Dark Academia media is largely subjective and there is not a set list of rules associated with the aesthetic. The media is recommended through tumblr posts, Goodreads bookshelves, Letterboxd lists, etc. The Dark Academia community tends to read books or watch movies. Anime, plays, musicals and podcasts are included here for their resemblance to the aesthetic, rather than them being discussed in the community. Here are the common tropes and traits of Dark Academic-specific media (not canonical literature). Note that not all works below have all traits: This has been extrapolated from media that is the most frequent on dark academia lists such as The Secret History, Frankenstein and Kill Your Darlings. The list of tropes should not be seen as an authority and this conversation varies amongst different members of the dark academia community. Novels (and films) that are considered Dark Academia take place in an academic setting, which includes high schools, boarding schools, and universities. These schools will have a prestigious reputation, with elements of exclusivity. The students would be of a higher socio-economic status, with mannerisms, clothing, and character concerns that reflect this. The time period varies, but the 19th-20th centuries are the most popular. The latter half of the 20th century to contemporary times would not include references to pop culture, technology, or the despairs typically associated with modern life (capitalism, consumerism, environmental destruction, etc.) This lack of modern technology may be one of the reasons why the contemprary audience is attracted to the genre- it is a form of escapism that allows the audience to be immersed in an environment that is extremely different from the quarantined audience of 2020.[8] The academic setting would also influence the characters in that their subject of study would appear in allusions and character motivations. The subject is almost always of the humanities; for example, Shakespeare in If We Were Villains or the classics in The Secret History. Knowledge is often esoteric and forbidden, creating a seductive allure. The most common traits among the media considered Dark Academia is the emphasis on prose. Elevated vocabulary, lavish detail, and insight into emotions and human character are paramount. Quotes are often shared among the community, making the work cemented as part of the Dark Academia \"canon.\" The characters, belonging to an academic setting, would be intelligent and largely passionate about their discipline. This can then turn to obsession, with the scholar or artist being willing to self-destruct or harm others for the sake of their work. In order to facilitate the drama of the narrative, some characters typically have traits of Machiavellianism, dishonesty, loyalty, and capriciousness. In Dark Academia novels, there typically is an in-group of students that have an established allure because of their expertise in their discipline, an air of mystery, or certain mannerisms that are foreign to both the audience and the other characters not in the clique. The main character, typically from a background not of the rest of the group, usually has more average traits and is new and/or unprivy to the rest of the group's dynamics and is able to describe these mannerisms to the audience. This is contrasted by the ringleader, who is typically the most intelligent, scheming, and/or authoritative of the clique. These personality types and backgrounds lead the plot to include a more complex understanding, and even esotericism and forbidden knowledge, within the humanities. The characters' ambitions often lead to motifs of hedonism, temptation and hubris; similar to Shelley's Frankenstein wherein the character has a god complex due to their intelligence or Faust, where the titular character trades knowledge for their soul. Because of their ambition and abnormal ways of thinking, the plot centers around committing a crime and/or the interpersonal relationships within the group. Betrayal, blackmailing, and codependency are often featured. As previously mentioned, Dark Academia includes the study of works deemed part of the \"canon\" and are rich in analysis. This wiki list will not include the canon, as there are hundreds of books that are consistently being analyzed and discssed. For the full list, please see the Wikipedia article. Please do not list books by authors already listed in the authors section. By author surname: By author surname: By year released: Some music typically associated with Dark Academia evokes the same historical and elite aesthetic through classical music, which is regarded as upper-class and traditional, with multiple people within these types of families encouraged to learn this type of music to create a wide profile of skills. Specifically, the classical music used is wide-ranging, as Baroque (Bach, Vivaldi) and Romantic (Liszt, Tchaikovsky) are included. The classical music used in the aesthetic is typically in a tone more romantic, melancholy, epic, or severe, as it is played in the minor key and with piano and strings. This contrasts many classical pieces that are cheerful and playful, which better fits into Light Academia. Contemporary alternative music is extremely popular in this aesthetic, if not more popular. There is a wide variety of instrumentation, although some common characteristics are: the use of strings or piano, slow and deep bass, and backing or echoing vocals. Tempo tends to be slower and like in classical, has a more melancholy and contemplative tone. Lyrically, these songs would have motifs that fit the drama, intellectualism, and wildness of the aesthetic. The lyrics may reference mythology and literature, have a higher vocabulary than the typical song, and reference yearning. However, \"shitposting\" (making content for the sake of humor) may result in some playlists with music that does not fit the style of Dark Academia, but fits the characters and plot points in the novels. So for example, a \"Dark Academia playlist\" may include a Broadway song about murder, which tonally clashes with the aesthetic. On YouTube, it is popular to create videos that are playlists for studying, with the video showing an image with the Dark Academic aesthetic. Titles conveying the common tropes in the genre are common, for example, \"talking with the ghosts in an abandoned library.\"[9] These playlists are a common entry for people into the aesthetic. The trend appeared in late 2020 and early 2021, as seen by the most popular videos being created approximately the same time.[10] The Aesthetics Wiki staff creates official Spotify playlists for aesthetics, which compile the songs most frequently featured on existing playlists dedicated to those aesthetics. Pages with an official wiki playlist will not include playlists from the public. The de facto Dark Academia activities are studying and reading. Learning about Dark Academia subjects (literature, languages, history, philosophy, etc.) is one of the ways that Dark Academia fans build community. Holding book clubs, recommending readings, and discussing theory with peers is done through tumblr asks and reblogs, Discord servers, and other social media sites. Solitary studying is more popular, however. Essay-writing, memorizing vocabulary and annotating literature are activities that are encouraged to pursue for fun. But unlike Studyblr, less emphasis is placed on sharing studying tips and the scholastic experience. Rather, the subject or the emotions felt during studying is discussed. For example, as opposed to infographics on the advantages of different note-styles, Dark Academics wax poetically about the euphoria associated with finally mastering a language. However, social situations such as parties and being within a group are more than encouraged. Being drunk and having engaging conversations is a popular wish for Dark Academics to have and why many people bond over this aesthetic. Dinner parties, coffee dates, and picnics in the forest are a frequent outlet for this, and wine, coffee, tea, bread, cheese, and upscale, traditional dishes are mentioned frequently in novels. Supernatural experiences and loss of control are activities that are wished for (but not done due to their improbability). There are frequent mentions of the \"bacchanal,\" which was the inciting incident of The Secret History, where the characters experienced divine madness through ritual. Creative pursuits are also encouraged. Romanticism is linked with expressing emotions. Journaling, acting in theater, writing poetry, and creating art are examples of this desire. What makes these activities \"fit\" the aesthetic is how closely it aligns with the patrician and academic class of the eras. For example, expressing oneself through rap music or making drip paintings would not be considered Dark Academic, but playing Chopin's Nocturnes or painting a naturalistic portrait of a lover would be. Visiting buildings that fit Dark Academia visuals, such as libraries, art museums, historic houses and churches is another way of experiencing the aesthetic. Existing and daydreaming in these spaces and taking note of the architecture and people in them is in line with the romanticism of the aesthetic. Sports such as squash, horse riding, croquet and lacrosse can be claimed as Dark Academia due to their connection with Preppy culture. Multiple private schools' aspiring Ivy League students are encouraged to involve themselves with these sports in order to create a diverse skill set. And as described in the Preppy page, many of these sports are obscure and would not be accessed by an average person. Chess is connotative of Dark Academia due to its emphasis on strategy, as well as intellect and dramatic tension being two of the main pillars of the game and the aesthetic's appeal. Chess has established itself as a sport done by calculating characters,[11] with its ubiquity throughout history[12] fitting into the 19th-early 20th century aesthetic. Card games can have the same association. Hobbies that are not necessarily intellectually or emotion-driven but have the appearance of the aesthetic are also included. These include calligraphy, book-binding and embroidery. The emphasis on improving oneself, dedication to a subject and active thinking and focus could be applied to these (and many more) hobbies. Again, what determines if a hobby could fit into the aesthetic is its resemblance to the visuals and connotations. The activities should fit the leisure class of the time periods. For comedy's sake, many Dark Academics banter about committing crimes such as murder, art theft, and blackmail. Of course, this is not achievable in real life nor is it actually done on a petty level. Rather, people read about characters doing this in fiction, create outfits for if they were to do these crimes, or craft a persona similar to a villain, such as recommending to smirk instead of smile. Dark Academia has been criticized for its apparent encouragement of unhealthy behavior in the pursuit of both the aesthetic itself and academic achievement.[13][14] Stress and procrastination related to education, depression and its symptoms, unhealthy sleep habits, including both under and oversleeping and excessive consumption of coffee, are frequently referenced and discussed in Dark Academic communities. Dark Academia focuses predominantly on languages, literature, architecture, art, poetry and fashion originating from Western Europe and has been consequently criticized as Eurocentric. Many Dark Academics have rejected an exclusionary interpretation of Dark Academia and encouraged academics to include non-Western languages, literature, architecture and clothing in their conceptions and use of the aesthetic.[15][16][17] One of the most romantizied things in Dark Academia is attending an elite university, especially Oxford and Cambridge in England or one of the Ivy Leagues in the United States. Additionally, prep and boarding schools are included in the aesthetic. These schools are prohibitively expensive for the average person, with admissions favoring those who come from wealth, especially if the family has a history of attending the school. Because of this, many criticize Dark Academia for having traits of classism. Another criticism of Dark Academia does not lie in its socio-political issues, but rather that Dark Academics are not necessarily intellectual, and overly emphasize the aesthetic rather than actually participate in academic work. Many, if not most, of the works included in the Dark Academia canon are pop literature, often from the young adult genre. Because of this, literature fans are exasperated when Dark Academics assume a persona of being intellectual and sophisticated, when the novels they read do not express the same literary quality as more rigorous novels do. The use of books being a point for fashion and lifestyle inspiration without much emphasis on critical thought is another contention. This is especially true with appreciation for The Secret History, which is supposed to be a satire- people trying to mimic their lifestyle and personality of the characters are missing the point of the novel mocking the main characters.[18] Many books demonstrate that pretentiousness and isolation from non-academics create hubris, leading to the characters' downfalls; readers who understand the theme would be less inclined to assume these relationship dynamics, presumably. Additionally, many critics claim that Dark Academia is more preoccupied with the visual aesthetic rather than studying and Academia itself. Rather than enjoying studying and reading because of the subject matter/themes, some critics say that these people are more preoccupied with projecting the impression of sophistication, in effect being poseurs. Fans of the aesthetic also, entirely inadvertently, changed the semantic meaning behind Academia as an amorphous class that includes the poor, people of color, and a variety of cultures to an aesthetic that emphasizes Western Eurocentricism and classicism, with a set lifestyle and mode of thought. From this, people will continue seeing Academia as a group of pretentious, ivory-tower types instead of seeing the diversity of real academics. Anti-intellectualism and a lack of class solidarity results from this misconception of Academia, and the aesthetic may perpetuate this view to the generation on social media.[19] Here are external links for further information on this aesthetic.

Dark Aero uses a darker color palette contrasting the depth-filled colorful motifs characteristic of Frutiger Aero. This gave the aesthetic a more simplistic look, which lead to it still being used after Frutiger Aero's decline. Another one of Dark Aero's main signature characteristics is aero glass. Dark Aero can be described as the middle ground between Frutiger Aero and Skeuomorphism due to its Frutiger Aero-esque imagery combined with Skeuomorphism's color palette. Whilst Frutiger Aero was more commonly used for mass market and commercial products, Dark Aero focused on high-end and enterprise-oriented items and services. Dark Aero was also commonly used for for modern tech such as smartphones, computers, TVs, cars, etc. In the early 2000s, Dark Aero emerged as an alternative variant of Frutiger Aero, featuring a darker visual style. Dark Aero's first documented appearance was in Windows Longhorn, a beta version of Windows Vista (developed from 2001-2006); this was during the transition period from Y2K Futurism to Frutiger Aero.  Dark Aero preserves the futuristic element of Frutiger Aero while largely omitting the nature/eco side of it. The futuristic approach of Dark Aero centers more around electronics rather than humanism, contrasting Frutiger Aero's style of futurism. During Dark Aero's beginning period in the early 2000s, it went largely unused and was over-shadowed by Frutiger Aero. In the late 2000s-early 2010s, Dark Aero's popularity gradually increased until it started to become more widely adopted across various systems and user interfaces. This was accompanied by the slow decline of Frutiger Aero, which began in 2012-2013. Dark Aero's prime encompasses the late 2000s-mid 2010s (c. 2006-2015). During this period, Dark Aero was most commonly associated with electronics, futurism, neon lights, electronica/dubstep music, flares, beams, holograms, etc. While it has found some presence in the corporate realm, it was most frequently embraced among the younger generation and internet culture, such as gamers, DJs, and programmers. Dark Aero persisted until the mid-2010s (2015-2017), until most big-tech companies decided to implement Flat Design, which marked the end of Frutiger Aero's mainstream usage along with its sub-genres. Despite Dark Aero's decline after 2015, it still continued to be used by several apps, websites and several Linux distributions. However, instead of classic Dark Aero, it was updated into a much more sleek and lighter version, featuring less glossy and futuristic elements, and making use of humanism again. This became known as Post-Morphism. Dark Aero can largely be described as more 'sleek' and 'cleaner' than Frutiger Aero due to its partial omission of varied color palettes, often achieving a less 'cluttered' look than its father-aesthetic. Motifs commonly associated with Dark Aero include, but are not limited to, bokeh, aurora borealis, gloss, aero glass, and futuristic designs. Dark Aero's visuals were also inspired by electronics, waves, spectrum, lasers, electronic pulses, etc. These elements give the aesthetic a sense of futuristic allure and technological wonder. Moreover, Dark Aero extends beyond the limitations of Frutiger Aero, It embraces a diverse array of backgrounds and textures, such as the elegant graphite, obsidian, dark cement, metal and various other dark textures. Frutiger Aurora is a subgenre of Frutiger Aero that focuses on the aurora visual; an aurora is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky. Frutiger Aurora emerged in the Early-2000s towards the end of the Y2K Futurism era and maintained it's popularity into the Early-2010s. The aurora visual is also commonplace in Dark Aero, leading to varied degrees of overlap between the two. Holo, also known as Dark Skeuomorphism, is a device theme and Skeuomorphism sub-aesthetic. It was developed by Google in Android versions 3.0 to 4.4 (four separate releases) and was used from 2011-2014. It was used in Honeycomb (2011), Ice Cream Sandwich (2011), Jelly Bean (2012), and KitKat (2013). Holo is a subgenre to and very similar to Skeuomorphism due to it's use of depth, texture, shading, and pseudo-3D imagery that attempts to mimic real world objects. This version of Skeuomorphism, however, is more watered down and flatter. Holo's backgrounds can be described as dark, simplistic yet calming due to its \"cold\" color palette; the most common colors are black, blue, indigo, violet, cyan, and purple. This is normally complimented with see-through abstract patterns or graphical effects. Holo is similar to Dark Aero due to its color palette and its utilization in UI/UX design. Post-Morphism, Also known as Skeuoflatism, Flat Skeuomorphism or alternatively Matte Design, was used during the decline of Skeuomorphism, which marked the transition from saturated realism to a simpler interface design. This design trend combines elements of Skeuomorphism and Flat Design. It features a simpler version of Skeuomorphism that doesn't use realistic textures but instead uses a bit of glossy shadows, reflections, subtle gradients and lighting effects. Dark Aero and Post-Morphism both share the element of being a more sleek and less detailed version of their parent-aesthetics.",

A Dark Fantasy is a fairytale without a happy ending, or it may have a happy ending that is only achieved with a great cost. It is despairing, violent, or sometimes even gory, but still contains elements of elegance and intrigue. However, the term can also refer to a dark, almost vampiric style of fashion and general aesthetic mood, and a type of music as well. There may also be overlap with Spriggancore and Goblincore, as well as Dethereal. Dark fantasy elapses a broad amount of different fashion genres, but notably plays off of gothic, academia, pirate, and royal aesthetics. This is expressed through dark colors and heavy fabrics, such as wool, tweed, leather, suede, and velvet.  (Please note that if you are creating a Dark Fantasy outfit, the cost of these different fabrics varies greatly and should be taken into account.) First and foremost are the fairy tales. These are not the ones that Disney packages into children's movies, with their true love's kiss and happy endings.

Though it shares a lot of imagery with both Nautical and  Pirate aesthetics, it borrows much more from Cottagecore in its romanticized interpretation of western life by the sea. Whereas Nautical tends to focus on much higher economic class aesthetics and Pirate on chaotic, Dark Nautical centers around a more simple and harmonized life like Cottagecore. What makes Dark Nautical distinct from Cottagecore is its focus on the sea aspect of nature rather than forests or meadows. Dark Nautical is also characterized by a healthy dose of melancholy that does not exist in any of the previously mentioned aesthetics. The aesthetic involves being both aware of the vast ocean: what it is capable of, and what lies below, as well as being isolated for long periods of time. This awareness of the danger involved with the sea aligns Dark Nautical with such aesthetics as Witchcore and Forestpunk. Originally conceived earlier, it experienced a resurgence in early 2021 as sea shanties became more popular. Earlier versions of the aesthetic include such works as Moby Dick by Herman Melville and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Visuals of Dark Nautical revolve around the sea, especially the more mysterious, dark aspects. This can include: Dark Nautical fashion is reminiscent of the 18th and 19th centuries and primarily broken up into two categories: feminine and masculine, but one shouldn't feel restricted to only one of these categories; gender isn't binary and Dark Nautical isn't either. The style is beachy yet dark, with lots of blues and grays. In cooler weather, comfy sweaters, thrifted goodies like flannels or old sweaters, and hand-knit beanies, socks and gloves are suggested.

Focused on fallen royalty, the aesthetic merges opulence with decay. It is inspired by aesthetics like dark academia, royalcore, punk, lobotomy chic, old money and the visuals of Breadtube (see: Contrapoints, Philosophy Tube). The Dark Royaltycore community celebrates the fusion of opulence and decline, emphasizing narratives of fallen nobility, entwined with themes of incestuous relationships and mental struggles. This aesthetic embraces left-wing values and post-irony, highlighting the rebellious spirit of regal figures against conventional norms. It encourages intellectual engagement through influences from dark academia and Breadtube, while acknowledging the intricacy of taboo subjects. Dark Royaltycore also includes motifs of criminality and danger. Secret societies, cults and murder are common subjects within the aesthetic. Characters within the works of fiction associated with Dark Academia, specifically The Secret History and Kill Your Darlings, live decadent and self-destructive lifestyles involving drugs, moments of intense violence, and secrets. This aesthetic had rooted during the end of the 19th century with the Decadence movement, and progressed to its peak in the early 20th century when a great number of aristocrats lost their wealth due to political shifts or the economic crises. It cyclically rises back to fame once every 60 years, see: Beat Generation, 2020s. Dark Royaltycore enjoyers despise right-wing values, yet they adopt their families' noble titles. This act stems from the Czech gay poet Jiří Karásek ze Lvovic. Castles, tattered curtains and tarnished silverware are some types of imagery that is present in Dark Royaltycore imagery in order to combine elements of fallen nobility and decay. Self-destructive habits are also portrayed in the aesthetic, and in visuals, this tends to manifest in smoking tobacco, which also was a very common thing to do in the past and still has some connotations of mystery and glamour. Other drugs and alcohol are in books, but are less common in photographs. As the morning sun bathes the room in a soft glow, you rise to embrace the allure of fallen nobility. The aroma of rich coffee fills the air, a companion to your contemplative thoughts. With a sense of anticipation, you cast your gaze upon the scattered books that adorn the floor, their pages beckoning you to immerse yourself in their world. You have no will to read anymore. They serve as a decoration that yoou show your friends to prove you are smart. And they remind you of the past, of how your life used to be. You light up a cigarette. And another. And another. You're down one pack, but mommy's got your back and stocks you up with cheap Polish cigs every month. You never run out. You spend the day lying down, coughing, dying, suffering, contemplating your life and drinking too many teas. You may even write a poem, or, attend a reading and steal the mic, as the true egomaniac you are. Most of the days, you visit a doctor or a psychiatrist since both your mental and physical health are very frail. Your evenings are spent observing queers that have fallen victims to the world of hard drugs. Some days, you even find yourself an hour away from your home on a mission to save someone. You might have accidentally turned your flat into a hotel. Dark Royaltycore's house decor brings together the opulence of castles and the intriguing allure of an addict's mindset, resulting in a unique fusion that embodies themes of fallen nobility and decadence. Maximalism takes center stage, with elements of Dark Academia artfully blended with a touch of unconventional charm. The house is adorned with old, second-hand wooden furniture that exudes a sense of history and character. Books find their place on the floor, creating an atmosphere reminiscent of a scholarly haven. Cigarette packs are scattered around, serving as a testament to the unconventional aspect of the aesthetic.\nWalls are adorned with a collage of cut-outs, book pages, random photos, maps, posters, and various artifacts that reflect the inhabitant's mindset and interests. This eclectic arrangement creates a visual narrative, allowing glimpses into their world and passions. Fancy mirrors add a touch of elegance, while draping fabrics ingeniously transform small rooms into spaces that evoke the ambiance of castle interiors, all achieved on a budget. Spotlights cast a soft glow, illuminating the carefully curated arrangements and enhancing the unique atmosphere. This lighting choice adds to the overall enchantment and warmth of the space. Dark Royaltycore fashion encapsulates an array of styles that harmoniously blend opulence, decadence, and a touch of rebellion. This attire draws inspiration from various historical periods, fashioning a distinctive look that resonates with fallen nobility and junkies. The most colors are black, white, darker shades of green, brown, beige and petroleum blue. Dark Royaltycore relies upon styling thrifted and passed-down items. You are a poor person, but you've also got an extravagant and maximalistic sense of style. Puffy royal shirts take center stage, adorned with ornate embellishments like lace, ruffles, and puffed sleeves. Collars, whether layered under sweaters or making a statement with sailor-style designs, play a crucial role in this aesthetic. Sweaters, especially turtlenecks, contribute an autumnal and bookish essence, often featuring cable-knit or embroidery for added texture. Many fans of this aesthetic also wear strange, DIY cropped shirts. Formal dress pants crafted from sturdy materials like tweed dominate the bottom half of the attire. Patterns like check and herringbone, along with pleats, add dimension to these pants. Skirts come in pleated and check-patterned styles reminiscent of prep school uniforms, flowing mid-length or long skirts for elegance, and straight pencil skirts with button details that exude a mature aesthetic. Sometimes, more punk-influenced bottoms may be used, such as customised ripped baggy jeans that fall off your bottoms as you walk. It is normal for some enjoyers of this aesthetic to run errands in their underwear. Dresses are often layered, with pinafores and sleeveless options serving as foundational pieces beneath turtlenecks or collared shirts. While some interpretations embrace romantic ballgowns or Medieval-inspired milkmaid dresses, layering remains a key principle. Outerwear takes a central role, particularly luxurious coats that symbolize sophistication. These coats, adorned with intricate details and opulent fabrics, create a stunning visual impact. Their structure and texture showcase the aesthetic's decadence and intricate narrative. The choice of coat type alters the overall vibe—long coats in dramatic black exude intensity, while tailored coats radiate classic elegance. Fur coats are also often worn to mimic the russian whore aesthetic. Other outerwear choices are sweaters, cardigans, leather jackets, warmer button-ups, denim jackets and so on and so on. The sweater/cardigan can also be tied over shoulders to mimic the advertisements for American Prep brands. Leather men's dress shoes, such as brogues and wing-tips, are very common in this aesthetic. For an edgier touch, Doc Marten's boots may be incorporated, seamlessly blending with the overall attire. Feminine ensembles often feature Mary-Janes or Victorian-esque footwear paired with long socks. Shoes with a platform over 10 cm are also very common, with most of them belonging to the brand Demonia. Accessories play a pivotal role in both masculine and feminine branches of the aesthetic. Suspenders and intricate belts become signature elements, adding a touch of vintage charm. The accessories spectrum expands to include zippo-holding or sparkly belts, capturing the dual essence of utility and extravagance. Gender-neutral leather vintage bags, especially messenger bags, maintain the aesthetic's fusion of practicality and refinement. Jewelry flourishes in both branches, with the masculine side incorporating rings as essential pieces that contribute to the intricate narrative. Rings, stacked in various styles, convey a sense of maximalism and personality. The feminine side revels in an abundance of jewelry, allowing rings to take center stage. Solid silver or gold pendants are common when paired with turtlenecks, while brooches add character and vintage allure. The fusion of rings and other jewelry elements showcases the aesthetic's decadence and individuality. From the refined Oscar Wilde-inspired bowl cut with added length to the edgy grown-out buzzcut intertwined with small braids, each style fuses historical influences with modern twists. The artful use of bleach introduces contrast and dimension, while the shaggy mod style conveys a rebellious yet refined vibe. Middle parts exude symmetry and balance, while mullets provide a bold and intriguing dichotomy of short and long. With an emphasis on standout hair, these styles, including the option of extremely bleached white hair, amplify individuality without venturing into unnatural colors, accentuating the essence of Dark Royaltycore. Dark Royaltycore's makeup captures a delicate balance of weariness and fragility, evoking a haunting allure that aligns with the aesthetic's themes of decay and fallen nobility. Achieving a tired look involves reddish eyebags, while pale skin with subtle blush enhances a sickly appearance. The eyes are often accentuated with eyeliner and white mascara. Cracked, bloody lips contribute to the morbidity. By year released: The music that fits the Dark Royaltycore vibe comes from a mix of different styles, like classical music, 1920s jazz, punk and post-punk, experimental and psychedelic rock and much more. Here are some of the artists and bands participants of the Dark Royaltycore aesthetic might like: Dark Royaltycore encompasses many activities. For comedy's sake, many Dark Royaltycore enjoyers banter about committing crimes such as murder, art theft, and blackmail. Of course, this is not achievable in real life nor is it actually done on a petty level. Rather, people read about characters doing this in fiction, create outfits for if they were to do these crimes, or craft a persona similar to a beloved beatnik protagonist.

The main emotional idea of it is the theme of corruption and loss of oneself. The physical elements tied to being warped and corrupted under a force one cannot control. It is also used in elements where characters are manipulated and corrupted by a force outside what is understood by humans. It shares aspects with Mind Murder, Gorecore, and Gothcore. It is often associated with Mind Murder, Glitch and Sizz; Starrflesh. Darkerrorcore was created by Nakaitsu for the Aesthetics Wiki. One controversy about this aesthetic is that it is too much alike to both 'Sizz' and 'Glitch'. Whereas it may use the same visuals and objects, this aesthetic is focused on psychological and emotional ideas. DarkErrorcore uses Sizz's manipulation and distortion (as a theme and visual detail) and Glitch effect (as a visual detail). DarkErrorcore uses colours like black, red and grey, and even sometimes white. Sometimes in drawings the backgrounds are simple or one color. Common patterns are swirls or lines. Textures that relate to it are slimy or sharp to the touch, static, textures that leave fingers numb when touching them. Effects related to the aesthetic are glitch effects, or sudden jarring movements. Objects and symbols that appear a lot within the aesthetic are that of eyes, knives, empty photo frames, hands, shadows, empty spaces full of fog or just plain empty places.

VDarkerrorcore is more about upbeat yet glitchy music, leaving out ambient music. DarkErrorcore music can also be songs that have a dark tone to them and feel like they fit the theme of corruption and confusion, though this is less common as ambient music or glitchy sounding music is preferred. The most common pattern in VDarkErrorcore is colourful static. VDarkErrorcore uses colours such as yellow, magenta, cyan and chartreuse to show the more confusing aspects of DarkErrorcore. Bright colours attempt to invoke being painful to look at. Common things in VDarkErrorcore are: spirals, old television sets, an 8Bit style, the surroundings melting and characters (if drawn) in pain. There are also eyes like DarkErrorcore and a glitching effect on the character. A character in the style is also often seen throwing up vibrant colours or static painfully.

Skulls, headstones, blood, and other symbols of death are staples in Darkest Academia visuals. Religious and occult imagery, especially related to Christianity, are featured frequently.

Many popular works within Darkest Academia generally have a dark, gothic atmosphere to them. Some of the influential writers are: Darkest academia music is typically calm and soothing. It is usually relaxed jazz or classical and operatic music, especially violin or piano. Since it is Darkest Academia, the sound and feel of the music are emotional.

It was founded by the poet and artist Joan Brossa in September of 1948 in Barcelona. This artistic movement was characterized by its interdisciplinary nature (such as poetry), and it was inspired by elements of Dadaism, Surrealism, Abstract Art, Symbolism and philosophical existentialism, and poetically depicted the nature of the conscious and subsconscious mind. The movement was 'rupturista' (a Catalan & Spanish word to describe the belief that the system or the estabilished social norms should change) and was created to experiment with new forms of artistic expression and reject traditional art styles. The Dau al Set movement was founded by Joan Brossa in Barcelona in (1948), after World War II and the Spanish Civil War. The movement was centered around the magazine of the same name, which started publishing content in 1948 until 1951. Other key figures of the movement included Arnau Puig, Joan Ponç, Antoni Tàpies, Modest Cuixart and Joan-Josep Tharrats. The Dau al Set played an important role in Spanish post-war era art, as they explored new cultural and philosophical alternatives and aimed to positivize Catalan society during the first dark years of Francisco Franco's regime in Spain. The movement ended in 1956 due to the unstable situation of the main group behind it. The Dau al Set magazine was founded by Joan-Josep Tharrats and it started being published along with the beginning of the art movement in 1948. It was a continuation of former magazine Algol, which was founded by the same group of people. Originally, the magazine was of Dadaist ideology, and the authors expressed their philosophical beliefs, such as being indifferent to society. Its ideology soon evolved into existentionalism and surrealism. The magazine especialized in various fields, such as philosophy, poetry and art.\nThe Museum of Modern Art of New York City classified this magazine as one of the best twenty Avant-garde magazines of the 20th century.

De Stijl consisted of artists, architects and designers brought together by Theo van Doesburg. In a narrower sense, the term De Stijl is used to refer to works from 1917 to c.1924 founded in the Netherlands. Proponents of De Stijl advocated pure abstraction and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to vertical and horizontal, using only black, white and primary colors. The movement's influence was immense, and continues to affect artists, designers and architects today. In Mondrian's opinion, only abstract art can show the harmony behind what's visible. He explored and refined his conception of pure colour and form his work and writings, becoming one of the most important artists of the 1st half of the 20th century and an important touchstone for all abstract artists. In the year this art movements was founded, there was still a war going on. With De Stijl, people longed for a world of inner peace, harmony and order, instead of the everyday chaos. The mission of artists of this movement was to create a new art in the spirit of peace and harmony. They believed that the reduction, the purification, of art (for, colour and line) would in turn lead to a renewal of society, and that when art was fully integrated into life it would no longer be necessary. Artists wanted to break the age-old tradition of art needing a clear presentation. They did not want to paint what was in front of them, for example a landscape, but they wanted to paint their feelings and thoughts.[1] And for them, that was best done by extreme simplicity and abstraction. They also argued that while a realistic painting shows reality, it does not show the truth.[2] De Stijl paintings are composed of horizontal and vertical lines, right angles, and rectangular or square surfaces of flat colours. The palette is reduced to primary colours of red, yellow and blue, and the neutral colours of white, black and grey. Architects wanted to \"start from zero\" with this movement, to break away from designing 'old-fashioned' houses. De Stijl architcture is similar with paintings of this aesthetic. It shows a similar clarity, austerity and order, taking the geometric abstraction of straight lines, right angles and clean surfaces in 3D. Gerrit Rietveld's Shröder House in Utrecht, the Netherlands (1924) is in many ways the masterpiece of the whole De Stijl movement. Features of De Stijl architecture: Out of all the De Stijl artists, Piet Mondrian is without any doubt the most famous. His paintings with white, black and primary colored-rectangles are very iconic. Because of this, they inspired multiple designers in created objects and fashion that remind us of these paintings.",

The traditional symbols of this subculture are the game Dota 2 and the anime Tokyo Ghoul, often using pictures of characters from the aforementioned anime which they often use in their profile. Classic expressions: \"I don't care, I'm dead inside\", \"1000-7\". The expression \"dead inside\" came about in 2014 when ALOHADANCE, a Dota 2 player, said in an interview that he was \"dead inside and didn't care about the game\". He made the expression his trademark and even tattooed himself with the phrase. In 2021, the phrase gained new popularity and began to be used to refer to pessimists who realized the complete meaninglessness of everything that was happening in reality, and decided to do nothing more. Such people began to discuss online what was happening, the decline of the world, everything else they saw. By 2022 \"dead inside\" is more popular as a meme than as a self-designation for \"sad\" people. People in these groups, especially those designated as \"zxc ghoul\" people by others, listen to aggressive/dark Phonk, hyperpop and rap.",

It has a sleeker and shiny aesthetic compared to Dieselpunk, which has a tendency to be more gritty and dark aesthetic to it. Often times, Decopunk will use slightly more modern technology compared to the times it's supposed to evoke like VHS tapes. Decopunk shares a lot in common with Dieselpunk aesthetics, but with more of a focus on the Art Deco style that was popular around the time.  A perfect visual example of the Decopunk aesthetic would be the original BioShock video game. A lot of Decopunk fashion does tend to draw upon Dieselpunk's similar influences, but there's definitely more of a focus on looking fashionable and classically presentable than there is on the grittiness one would find within the Dieselpunk genre. Definitely expect more zoot suits, dresses, and higher-end fashion in Decopunk circles than you would find within the Dieselpunk genre of aesthetics. Ottensian Dieselpunk is focused on the aesthetics and decadence of the Roaring Twenties and is another term for Decopunk. This leads to speculation on how it would evolve if it were completely uninterrupted by the 1929 Market Crash (Black Tuesday) that led to the Great Depression or by either World War and generally has a more utopian vision of the future (similar to the relationship between Solarpunk and Cyberpunk) and is more of a version of Retro-Futurism. Examples of fiction that work into the Ottensian Decopunk label include The Rocketeer, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, and (retroactively), the works of Isaac Asimov. Other works of fiction associated with Decopunk include the works of H.P. Lovecraft and noir fiction like Casablanca and LA Noire.",

It originated as an experimental offshoot of the Alt TikTok community, and it reached peak popularity throughout 2020 and 2021. This community was characterized by its aesthetic involving absurd content, edited YouTube Kids videos (particularly ElsaGate content), jumpscares and scary face masks, videos about frogs, body horror and disfigured faces, bright colour filters, glitch effects, repetitive sound effects, among others, creating a sense of disorientation and evoking the feeling of watching \"cursed\" content. When TikTok became a popular social media platform during the early 2020s, many users advocated for the segregation of its community based on common insterests and video styles. Alt TikTok or Alternative TikTok was considered the \"cooler\" side of the community, while the more average community was called Straight TikTok or StraightTok, which was criticized for being too mainstream, unfunny, boring or try-hard. Eventually, these two imaginary divisions of the TikTok userbase started to fade away in differences, and Alt TikTok was no longer considered as interesting and unique as it once was since many users who considered themselves \"Straight TikTokers\" switched sides. Deep TikTok was created as a way more niche version of Alt TikTok and it consisted of surreal content that rejected all types of mainstream content. Essentially, DeepTok is a wordplay on the Deep Web, which is often stereotyped as the weird side of the Internet. DeepTok videos reached the FYPs (For You Pages) of many TikTok users during 2020 and 2021. However, by 2022, it became a fad and was replaced by the Flop TikTok community. The popularity of this style also coincided with the rise of the Weirdcore aesthetic. Some visuals featured in Deep TikTok include: Deep TikTok users often engage in inside jokes, memes, and trends that may seem bizarre or nonsensical to outsiders. The Deep TikTok community's userbase is characterized by its own set of slang and phrases. Some common lingo and phrases used in Deep TikTok include: Another common trait of Deep TikTok slang was the usage of accents and letters from foreign languages (usually with Latin script, although other content creators have also used foreign languages with the intention to shock, similar to Xpiritualism). Overusing emojis in a surreal way was also an important trait of the DeepTok lingo. Other audios used within the DeepTok community included \"cursed\" audios and repetitive childish sounds.

The aesthetic originated on Tumblr from the mid 2010s. It co-existed and shared many visuals with the Morute community, except this one is entirely uninvolved in morbid themes. There is a lot of influence on the Babycore and Gloomy Coquette aesthetics. Rather, this aesthetic focuses on feelings of comfort, cuteness, and safety, the opposite of Morute which centers around trauma and mental illness. The name for this aesthetic was created for this wiki and only for documentation purposes. Originally, the aesthetic went without a name on Tumblr and could be found on individual blogs through tags such as #pink, #cute, #delicate (hence the name), etc. However, now it can be associated with the Coquette community especially since it has inspired the Dollette aesthetic. This aesthetic appeared in the mid-2010s on Tumblr. Multiple aesthetics were concurrent to it, which influenced it. These include Morute, Nymphet, Angelcore, Cult Party Kei, and Dollcore. The first two were influential in that they both also used images of vintage American femininity, with the communities even reblogging from the same photographers, such as Jess Woods. Angelcore(particularly Cherubcore), influenced delicate sweet in terms of imagery as well. The latter two influenced Delicate Sweet in terms of fashion, with light-colored diaphanous fabrics, and frilly doll-like dresses all being important aspects. \"Stay safe\" is a phrase that could briefly define this aesthetic's beliefs, but other positive thoughts related to self care are also very common between enthusiasts. Being kind to others and to yourself, respecting limits and resting properly are important points that are always remembered. It is common to find positive phrases along with images of this aesthetic, since the goal of it is to spread feelings of safety and comfort. The motifs are centered around elements of innocence, indoor environments (mainly bedrooms) and soft sweets. This aesthetic is focused on feminine fashion and it's based on a delicate, natural and modest appearance. Old thrifted and handmade clothing are a preference, for having a more \"comforting\" feeling to them. The melodies related to this aesthetic are music box melodies and gentle soundtracks, generally. Inside activities are more common within the aesthetic, usually related to crafting or simply resting and taking care of yourself.",

It is also a musical genre closely related to J-core and Pop music, which may also be less commonly known as \"Akiba-Pop\" or \"A-Pop\". In Japan, the terms Denpa-kei (電波系) or Denpa-san (電波さん) particularly refer to people who are perceived as disconnected from reality and the people around them, or decide to live out vivid fantasies inside their dreams. The concept of Denpa shares many similiarities with how a major part of Japanese society saw the Otaku subculture during the 1990s-2000s, especially those who suffered from mental health disorders like MADD (Maladaptative Daydreaming Disorder), Schizophrenia or Paranoia. Denpa fiction was pioneered during these decades through the Visual Novel and Eroge video game genres; for example, the Denpa game Shizuku, released in 1996, is often cited as the first visual novel. Denpa can be considered pretty diverse because it can apply to a subculture of people, a character trope, a music genre, and a fiction genre primarily present in video games and anime shows. In other words, the genre often depicts those persons in mundane environments experiencing the breaking of reality. Such examples of Denpa can be found in diverse formats and popular media, including video games, more so in the  Visual Novel and Eroge genres, light novels, manga, anime and music[2]. Denpa video games usually form part of the larger visual novel genre; in fact, the first visual novel games ever were marketed as Denpa. The Denpa game genre typically features a distinctive style that incorporates elements of technology (like electromagnetic or radio waves, such as antennas and telephone poles) and also explore topics that are often considered taboo in Japanese society, such as paranoia, anxiety, delusion, madness, trauma, depression and even suicide, typically in urban areas. However, Denpa music is rather characterized by its distinctive Moe aesthetic. The aesthetic that Denpa music uses is often called \"Moe-Denpa\" to visually set it apart from the gloomier traditional style. \"Denpa\" in the Japanese language literally means \"electromagnetic wave\", and the original sense of a Denpa-san/Denpa-kei was of someone who thought they were receiving voices, thoughts, or instructions directly to their mind through electromagnetic radiation or electronic harassment. The term \"Denpa\" was originally associated with a real-life murder incident, namely the Fukagawa Street murders. On July 11, 1981, a man called Kawamata Gunji stabbed four people to death and injured three others during a stabbing spree. The victims were specifically  women and children. Kawamata Gunji suffered from paranoia and during his trial claimed that he was compelled to commit the crimes because he had been getting \"electronically harassed\" by radio waves for years, and these supossedly created \"voices\" that told him to kill people[3]. The incident and his trial gained significant attention in Japanese popular culture, inspiring documentaries, television dramas, and novels. Therefore, the word \"Denpa-kei\" later started to appear in Japanese literary works and songs to describe \"quirky\" and \"insane\" people who could hear voices, hallucinate and apparently communicate with telepathy due to electromagnetic radiation, particularly during the early 1990s. Some of the earliest media to be classified under the Denpa genre are Shizuku (which is often cited as the first Visual Novel game) and the animes Paranoia Agent and Welcome to the N.H.K. The visuals associated with this genre are broad. There's not a general consensus on what Denpa visuals mean due to the diversity of the genre, but some people opt for dividing the visuals into two categories; \"Classic\" and \"Moe-Denpa\". The classic style can be appreciated in most examples of Denpa media, and it usually features imagery relating to technology and insanity, while \"Moe-Denpa\" is an aesthetic almost exclusively found in Denpa music, which is known for its distinctive Kawaii aesthetic. However, despite the visual differences, both still share the same origin, philosophy and motifs related to fantasy and insanity. The Classic Denpa aesthetic is mainly associated with Denpa games part of the Visual Novel genre and Denpa animes from the 1990s-2000s, which often feature elements of Horror and eroticism (particularly in Eroge Visual Novels). Although this style is mostly associated with Horror games and anime, the genre can also co-exist with drama, action or thriller stories (with some of the most notable examples being Neon Genesis Evangelion, Serial Experiments Lain, Boogiepop Phantom and Aku no Hana). This genre typically features imagery relating to technology that uses electromagnetic/radio waves, such as antennas and telephone poles, and explores topics like paranoia, depression, suicide and urban or life in the suburbs of Japan. The game Shizuku (1996) and the show Paranoia Agent (2004) are often cited as the pioneers of this style. Some visuals prominent in Classic Denpa include: Moe-Denpa (もえー電波) is the name given to the aesthetic associated with the Moe-Denpa music subgenre and the dōjin circles  surrounding it. This visual aesthetic is evidently found in the cover arts of these albums and songs, often featuring Moe anime characters, pastel colors and surreal, yet whimsical imagery. It's basically completely different when compared to the Classic Denpa style that's found on Visual Novels and the Eroge genre, although it still shares the same origin. Some visuals prominent in Moe-Denpa include: In Japan, the term \"Denpa\" was originally used to designate insane and quirky people who were thought to be controlled by electromagnetic radiation, which can be found in pretty much any electronics. People or fictional characters who are described as Denpa-kei or self-describe as such are often described as people detached from society and reality.. The stereotypical Denpa attitude in works of fiction includes heavy escapism, allowing viewers to escape from the pressures of everyday life and enter a world of fantasy and imagination. Some Denpa game storylines also often feature scenarios where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are blurred, including existentialism and questioning the nature of reality itself. Other similiar archetypes or subcultures in Japan and Japanese fiction are Hikikomoris (loners who are nearly or fully withdrawn from social interaction), Chūnibyōs (young teenagers who are delusional and attention-seekers, who believe they might be superhumans with superior knowledge or magical powers) and Jouhatsus (a Japanese social phenomenon of people who completely disappear from their social lives without leaving any sort of trace). The Denpa-kei subculture also shares many similarities with the stereotype of \"Tin Foil Hatters\" in English-speaking countries[4], which refers to people who believe wearing tin foil hats will prevent their brains from getting \"controlled\" by the government, technology, corporations or criminals. Denpa Songs (電波ソング) are a musical genre similar to both J-Pop and Electronic Dance Music (specifically J-core) that are intentionally bizarre yet catchy and cute[5]. Other terms that were coined more recently for this music style are A-Pop or Akiba-Pop, because of its connection with the Akihabara district in Tokyo (which is renowned for being the \"capital\" of Otaku culture). Denpa songs are characterized by their fast speed, bizarre topics, catchy rhythm and awkward and/or dissonant lyrics. Other defining features include cute high-pitched vocals, and repetitive onomatopeias or exaggerated chants. The lyrics are often often related to the Otaku subculture and non-sensical. Its most well known and prominent subgenre is Moe-Denpa (もえー電波), which is characterized by its Moe anime visual style  and its exaggeratedly cute high-pitched vocals. This genre was solidified in the early 2000s by artists such as Under17 and MOSAIC.WAV, who personally called their music Akiba-Pop, and they were commonly played in various shops of Akihabara and Harajuku during the decade. Although Denpa music usually sounds upbeat and cute, some common topics in the songs are delusion, telepathy and insanity, and because of that it is often deemed  creepy in popular culture due to its repetitive and exaggerated lyrics, off-key singing and chaotic tone. As previously mentioned, \"Denpa\" became slang in Japan for people that appeared to be delusional, insane or disconnected from reality, such as Otaku. So in this context, Denpa music also bears this name because it sounds like \"something people described that Denpa-kei would listen to\". Because of that, the genre carried negative connotations during its early years because it was considered to be \"brainwashing music\", since it often touches Otaku themes and non-sensical topics. However, some efforts were made to break away from the stereotype, hence why some newer terms like \"Akiba-Pop\" or \"A-Pop\" were coined. Therefore, Denpa music isn't as stigmatized as the game genre as a whole. The genre primarily thrives within the Japanese Dōjin scene (independent music circles), and many albums and songs are often sold or released during dōjin events such as Comiket. The genre gained wider recognition outside Japan through its inclusion in popular Japanese rhythm games like Beatmania, the BEMANI series and Sound Voltex. Although they are not Denpa games, the fandom of the Touhou Project series was also notably involved in its popularization, since dōjin circles such as IOSYS or C.H.S often make arranges of songs from Touhou Project video games and Denpa songs inspired by the game. Also, it's important to distinguish Denpa from J-Pop. While both share a focus on catchy melodies and Pop styles, J-Pop is a mainstream genre heavily influenced by the idol movement. Conversely, Denpa music remains largely underground and draws inspiration from the Otaku subculture.",

It can also include buildings from the time period such as saloons, ranches, and oil rigs. American Desert also occasionally carries a strong connection to the environmental movements of the time. This is because many american environmentalists were enamored with the beauty of the desert, and wrote extensively about its merits as a location and the lifestyle it proposed. The most famous example of this is Edward Abbey's The Monkey Wrench Gang, famous for also advocating domestic terrorism as a key component of the aesthetic. Notable motifs include Mexican blankets, reptiles (primarily iguanas), fire, the Southwestern US & Mexico, Mexican pirate radio, human skeletons, and imagery inspired by Dia de los Muertos.

Most examples of digital horror may incorporate elements of existential horror, Lovecraftian horror, and the feelings of dread and/or nostalgia. While there are no defining visuals for Digital Horror, there are some key aesthetics most Digital Horror include, such as low quality footage, usage of the Comic Sans font, and the use of old editing and recording software such as Bandicam. Akin to Analog Horror, Digital Horror isn't music based, but there are some songs that fit the Digital Horror aesthetic. They mostly include EDM, trap, lo-fi, and other music genres similar to those mentioned. People usually get Digital Horror confused with Analog Horror and ARGs (Alternate Reality Games) genres usually because of their stylistic qualities. Most digital horror videos are low quality to mimic the style of 2000's YouTube videos and most Analog Horror videos have low quality and/or grainy footage which confuses people with the two aesthetics. People occasionally refer to Digital Horror as \"ARGs\" even when there is no ARG in the digital horror. A few Digital Horror series do have some ARGs in them such as The June Archives and some ARGs have been classified as \"Digital Horror\" such as hiimmarymary and i_know_where_she_is. Digital Horror has been getting more attention thanks to YouTubers like Sagan Hawkes discussing about this topic, and thanks to that a lot of people can now properly differentiate between Digital Horror, Analog Horror and ARGs.",

This type of restaurant was cemented into American culture with the rise of travel during this time period. Having a place to rest and eat hearty food was a boon for many people who started road-tripping. Today, many travelers still go to diners, but they have gradually declined because of the fast food industry, chain restaurants, and a desire to eat new foods. While the diner is a stop for travel, it also provides comfort to the locals and facilitates new encounters with kind strangers. Its owners and employees are typically the paragon of American homey stereotypes: hard-working blue collar people who want to make a living and enjoy life in their independent restaurant. Diners also evoke comfort in Americans because of the comfort food they serve. The diner is a significant place in fiction because of this. Media, especially centered around high school students or wanderers, typically uses diners as meeting places or encounters with new characters. There are mainly 2 types of ways this aesthetic is utilized. One is the traditional, and the other is modern. The traditional version uses warmer colors and generally sticks closer to historical accuracy, with little-to-no use of over-the-top tropes and kitsch. The modern version is as it sounds--a modern take on the 1950s diners, transforming it with brighter colors, sometimes neon and Glowwave. Many modern businesses also try to capitalize on the novelty and clutter the restaurant with paraphernalia that reminds the diners of the 1950s. The fashion generally sticks to general 1950s fashion, but usually with a focus on the waitress outfits of that time. Some diners also advertise that their waitresses use roller skates, a connection to the rise of the roller rink in the past.",

As the god of wine, Dionysus is supposed to spread the knowledge of how to grow grape vines. In ancient Greece, wine was one of the few goods they could produce. Because of this, Dionysus was a major deity, and it was said that he was one of the twelve gods that lived upon Mount Olympus. Temples were erected in his honor and worship of him spread throughout the Greek poleis. Annual festivals called Dionysia were held in the honor of Dionysus and, of course, the purpose was to relax, feast, dance, and drink wine. Some dances in honor of him were performed on oiled wineskins, which were bags made out of animal skins that were filled with wine. Dionysus loved goats, donkeys, and tigers. Not only were those animals at the Dionysia, but their skins were also danced upon. When someone fell off the oiled wineskins, everyone cheered, laughed, and drank wine. In place of these outdated traditions, modern Dionysism may take place at various rowdy parties where alcohol is present and modern equivalences may be toga parties and dinner parties. There are two facets to Dionysism; classical and contemporary, both explained in full below. However, the long and short of it is that classical Dionysism draws inspiration from the true Cult of Dionysus, while contemporary Dionysism draws from modern ideas of hedonism, usually stemming as a way to cope with burnout. Note that both strains of Dionysism below have unhealthy behaviors attached to them. Whatever you do, be sure to be responsible and take care of your health. Classical Dionysism based on the original Cult of Dionysus. Think parties in the woods, dryads and satyrs, dilapidated marble statues, abandoned stone buildings full of rowdy drunks, and metal goblets filled to the brim with wine. This is almost the idealized version, but there’s no right or wrong way to do it. Contemporary Dionysism is based on modern hedonism being used as a way to help with burnout. A lot of imagery comes from frat parties where everything just feels a little magical, even if it’s just the alcohol talking. Imagery includes smoking on someone’s roof, a smokey basement with colorful lighting, toga parties, running from the cops with friends, and talking with the beautiful stranger in the corner. Dionysism has a core value of hedonism, so comfort is first and foremost in a Dionystic outfit. Classical Grecian influences are equally important. This means earthy colors like sky blues and grass greens, linen whites, and metals like copper and gold. Some common fashion aspects and clothing pieces can include: Under contsruction",

It was a semi-androgynous fashion movement (much as Glam Rock was). These Disco artists went on to influence music in the late '70s & early '80s. This later led to the creation of Sophisti-Pop, a hybrid of blue-eyed Soul & Synth-Pop seen in the New Romantic movement.

It originated during the late 1980s and its popularity peaked from 1995 to 1997. Consequently, many Disco Polo cover arts and festival flyers use colorful and kitschy aesthetics that were popular from the 90s to the 2000s, including some visual similiarities with Frutiger Metro or Y2K Futurism. Originally known as Sidewalk Music (Polish: Muzyka Chodnikowa) or Backyard Music (Polish: Muzyka Podwórkowa), the term Disco Polo was coined in 1993 by singer-songriter Skręta as a tongue-in-cheek response to Italo Disco, but quickly became the most popular name for this genre. The songs are characterized by their simple melodies, catchy rhythms, and often lighthearted lyrics. Its popularity started declining in the 21st century, although it sometimes has resurgence in popularity. The history of Disco Polo is often divided in two phases: 1990s being the first wave, and 2010s. The earliest days of Disco Polo started in the late 1980s, with a sound closer to Polish Folk music than to Eurodance. These songs were often played at traditional weddings, and later, acoustic instruments were replaced with electronic ones. The genre was first known as Sidewalk Music (Muzyka Chodnikowa) and gained prominence in smaller towns and the Polish countryside, especially reaching peak popularity in 1994.However, as Disco Polo went more mainstream, it also became a really hated genre in urban cities - the kitschy aesthetics/sounds and unchallenging lyrics (for example: the song Majteczki w Kropeczki, which translates to \"Panties with Polka Dots\") were deemed \"embarrasing\" or \"cringe\" by many[1]. The genre heavily declined in the 2000s but in the next decade there were some attempts of resurgence. Some musical artists might classify their own music as \"Neo-Disco Polo\" to differenciate itself from the first wave of Disco Polo music and a few politicians also used the music to serve their agenda. The visuals seen in Disco Polo music are mainly expressed through cover arts, flyers and music videos. These mainly include low quality CGI, colorful imagery, elements of aesthetics that were prevalent during the decades of the 80s-2000s, such as Frutiger Metro, Frutiger Aurora or Disco, as well as Kitsch. The subculture associated with Disco Polo music also has its own unique characteristics. Another common topic in Disco Polo music includes weddings and love. Like many other musical genres such as Reggaeton or Emo, Disco Polo also gained its own fanbase and a subculture was developed around it. The Polish name given to the subculture is Discopolowcy (roughly translating to \"Discopolists\")[2]. Some stereotypes associated with this subculture include being from the countryside (because the subculture is way more popular in rural areas than major cities, see the Criticism section), taking the lyrics of the songs as personal mottos, going to parties and weddings, using excessive hair gel and loving Dance music. The stereotypical appareance of the Discopolowcy includes excessive hair gel, white and stylish sneakers, colorful and tight t-shirts, Hip-Hop-inspired sweatshirts, fabric trousers, gold chain necklaces and other accessories such as leather wallets or cheap chain bracelets. Disco Polo songs are characterized by: Despite its prior position of prevalence during the 90s, Disco Polo is far from being a music genre without critics. Nowadays this genre is widely disliked in Poland, especially in urban areas, because many think most of the songs are low-effort, have forced and unoriginal lyrics or are mass-produced. Some Disco Polo record labels and gangs such as Psycho Fans were exposed for being cover-ups for money laundering activities ran by criminal organizations[3], leading to the musical genre sometimes being discredited for its association with illegal activity. At some point, Disco Polo fans became the butt of the joke in Poland.",

While Grimoire, a shop, was influential in the creation of Dolly Kei, the fashion itself is not very brand focused. It is important to note that the term \"Dolly Kei\" is only used in reference to this particular fashion outside of Japan while locals use it to describe a doll-like aesthetic in general. An outfit must have a vintage look to be considered Dolly Kei. It is also characterized by a dark appearance, layering, lace, embroidery, animal fur (usually faux), as well as large accessories based around creepy fairytales. Some argue that large accessories are the most important part of this style, specifically lace chokers or even skulls. The fabrics in the outfits are usually heavy and in deep dark jewel-tones or black with a battered, worn, distressed appearance. Dolly Kei outfits do not have to look cohesive. Clashing of patterns, colors, and accessories is encouraged. Hairstyles tend to be natural and simple, with wavy hair and braids being common. Hair colors tend to be dark natural colors, including black, brown, and dark red. While Dolly Kei is mainly based on visuals, there are some activities that are common amongst people that wear Dolly Kei, that are also based upon old-fashioned things and are expressed in Dolly Kei outfits, including:[1] External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

These types of images are usually edited with depressing filters (like old tapes, vintage or gloomy filters) and music genres like Post-Punk, Synthpop, Synthwave, Shoegaze, etc. The signature character associated with this aesthetic is the \"Doomer\", a Wojak meme character originating from 4chan. The Doomer is depicted as an hopeless adult man who deals with problems like depression and opioid addiction. The Doomer aesthetic sometimes also includes anti-war topics, particularly relating to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, showing images of devastated places. Some visuals prominent in the Doomer aesthetic include: Doomer is not only a subculture but also a global general way of thinking. In fact, the term \"Doomer\" was used as early as 2008 by the Peaknik community, which essentially consists of people who believe in the Peak Oil conspiracy theory[1]. Later, exactly one decade later, in 2018, various 4chan users started making Wojak memes out of various characters ending in \"-oomer\" (referencing the term \"boomer\"). Among them, there was a character called \"The Doomer\", which gained traction on social media platforms due to its melancholic nature. The internet subculture spawned after this meme was characterized by a dark and hopeless interpretation of the world and modern society, and those who describe themselves as \"Doomers\" express this through their music taste, ideology, fashion, and aesthetic pictures. Essentially, the four main emotions associated with the Doomer subculture are alienation, pessimism, nihilism and despair. Another key value often found in this subculture is pacifism, as some people have used this aesthetic as a way to cope with the harsh realities of life in war-torn countries. Doomerwave itself is sometimes described as a microgenre that combines Post-Punk with Vaporwave and Chopped 'n' Screwed music[2]. Doomerwave songs usually consist of sampling Post-Rock or Post-Punk. The samples are slowed down both in speed and pitch, and melancholic elements are added, like record cackles, glitch sound effects and high reverb. Multiple Doomerwave remixes can be found on YouTube and Reddit, where they gained a cult following. Moreover, other than Doomerwave, the Doomer aesthetic is generally associated with a wide number of musical genres. The most predominant music listened by the Doomer community generally includes Post-Punk or Synthpop. However, most songs that have a sad and existential vibe in general can be used in this aesthetic. As described by various members of the community, Doomer songs convey feelings of somber, melancholy and bittersweet emotions[3]. Some musical genres associated with the Doomer subculture include: The Doomer aesthetic is sometimes criticized for aestheticizing nihilism and depression. Some people argue that the Doomer aesthetic is promoting these negative and destructive philosophies, and that it potentially discourages people from taking action to improve their lives or the world around them.",

It embraces positive feelings and intends to lift moods. This style came about during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to uplift people's moods and promote positive energy during quarantine. Eventually this aesthetic has become popular in clothing, interior and visual designs, and has seemed to gain the most traction in China. Dopamine is said to be the complete opposite of the minimalist style that has been trending in the design industry in the recent years with the heavy use of highly saturated, bright, and vibrant colors, such as yellow, orange, hot pink, and neon green. The colors are supposed to stimulate the brain's nervous system and induce a good mood seeing them. Through color matching bright and lively color segments, Dopamine visuals create a positive atmosphere. Motifs within the aesthetic are usually kept in a simple style and often consist out of fruits and candy that match the primary color of the design or outfit. When it comes to interior design, the  Dopamine style doesn't stick to a traditional home layout and mostly adopts an open design that allows for more flexibility in line with the intention of the aesthetic that's \"creating a comfortable and pleasant living experience\". Besides the importance of color matching. Dopamine also pays great attention to the luster of the materials used and vibrant plastics, glass, and ceramic titles are commonly seen as they reflect light and therefore help create a brighter home atmosphere. All kinds of fashion styles can be seen in the aesthetic as long as they are in the typical refreshing colors. There are many different combinations of vibrant colors that contrast each other to harmonize the overall atmosphere and create a multi-level coordination effect in the outfits. Fluorescent tops, leg warmers, jelly sandals, fruit accessories, and positive vibes are  indispensable from Dopamine.",

The aesthetic is especially popular on Pinterest and TikTok, where users compile images of women and men who would fit such the aesthetic and create outfits. Visually, it involves a more cozy, almost autumnal view of cities and emphasizes having a cultured lifestyle of visiting museums, cafés, and meeting friends, as opposed to a more \"street\" style, which is described in Urbancore. However, it also incorporates elements of Grunge, with the laid-back attitude and admiration for the music and visual culture of that community. It also takes a lot of inspiration from Twilightcore, an aesthetic that is inspired by a gloomy interpretation of 2000s fashion. It contrasts the Uptown Girl aesthetic in that it is more casual and does not involve as many markers of wealth and hyper-femininity. It is often grouped with Coquette due to common features such as Lana Del Rey music and Brandy Melville clothing, but it has a  different clothing style and a different color scheme. The term \"downtown\" originates from the United States and is commonly used to refer to the central area of cities. The reputation of downtowns being a place for alternative, countercultural people interested in art and literature emerged in the 1970s and 1980s in New York, specifically in neighborhoods like SoHo (South of Houston Street) and the East Village[1]. Avant-garde artists, poets, and writers contrasted the grunge-y, dangerous streets, which is a romantic image. The aesthetic also takes inspiration, at times, from Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and old southern port cities like Charleston and New Orleans. The appeal of these cities came from them possessing the markers of cultural sophistication, such as museums, cafes, fashion, and a distinctive local culture in contrast to suburbs and rural areas. Another aspect of the appeal is the blend of cultures, socio-economic classes, etc. that led to urban aesthetics often involving blends between high and low culture. This fascination with downtown living has often been a motif in popular culture, including TV shows such as Friends and Sex in the City, music based on urban genres, and literature themed around urban living. The \"Downtown Girl\" and \"Downtown Boy\" aesthetics began to emerge on social media, found predominantly on TikTok and Pinterest approximately in 2022. Like other social media aesthetics, it revolves around the creation of short videos and images focusing on aspirational fashion and lifestyles of teenagers and young adults. Many concurrent trends influenced the look of Downtown Girl. For example, the revival of 2000s fashion[2], trendiness of the brand Brandy Melville, and the rise in grunge fashion are connected to this aesthetic. The most important visual aspect is images of cities themselves. The architecture of cities, with their great height, balconies, fire escapes, and extreme proximity, are common in the background photos of outfits. Subways and buses are also heavily featured, with the windows being places to capture the city and add a romantic image to the girl looking out of them. Scaffolding is also common, and adds a grunge and industrial element. The different \"icons\" of a city also tells the viewer the specific city the person is in- for example, the yellow cabs of New York or the Haussman architecture of Paris. The cities themselves are most often rainy or in darker periods of the day. The aesthetic in general is more intimate, as opposed to sunny and open. Autumn is also an important element of the aesthetic. Fallen leaves, hot coffee, and sweaters are some of the most common photos in the aesthetic, and can even be featured in the music (\"We Fell in Love in October\" by Girl in Red, \"Autumn in New York\" sung by various jazz singers, etc.) Downtown Girls' and Boys' photos most often feature themselves visiting locations that have a hip, bookish vibe that matches the Bohemian and vintage connotations of being in a Downtown area. Specifically, places that sell secondhand goods and traditional media: bookstores, thrift shops, and record shops are the most favored. As the Internet becomes more common, these stores are harder to come by and are more exclusive to cities. Like the 2014 hipster era, possessing and admiring traditional and older media is seen as cool and unique. Images of people reading books is a common photo, especially with books that appear older and more artistic in subject. Likewise, all sorts of cameras, as opposed to the cameras from a phone, are featured  and imply that the person in the photo has the hobby of photography. Photographers are also common in cities and are a more artistic and adventurous endeavor. Music's visual culture is also prominent, as this aesthetic values having an admiration and ability to create music. And as previously discussed, physical media with a vintage feel is valued; this is reflected in CDs, vinyls, over-the-ear headphones, and earbuds are some examples, with the latter two even being used as accessories in outfits. Electric guitars and basses are some common instruments in photos, as those are the instruments played in old rock-and-roll, grunge, and other older counter-cultural music movements. Old posters and band tees are also collected, often in a manner that looks cluttered and cozy. Fitting in with the busy and urban lifestyle, coffee is photographed, both held in disposable paper cups for on-the-go, and in cafés, which are a thing noted for being a more city-oriented place that attracts people that are traditionally more introverted and intellectual. The aesthetic also includes domestic and cozy scenes. Cats, bedsheets, and people generally relaxing are often in photos, providing a break from the busier images of small stores and cluttered streets. On TikTok, there is also more of a focus on bedroom decorations, which allows people who do not live in cities to join in on the aesthetic. However, nightlife is also a major part of cities and youth culture, and thus a major part of the aesthetic. But rather than photos explicitly showing clubbing or concerts, the photos are of after the event, with girls and their friends walking in the streets at night in their fancier outfits. The Downtown Girl fashion often tends to include: Downtown boy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Colors\nBlack, white, beige, red, and brown\n\n\nKey Values\nBooks, coffee, tea, music\n\n\nRelated Aesthetics\nPale GrungeCoquetteTwilightcoreAutumnDollette Downtown boy emerged around the same time as downtown girl, and the style has a similar appearance to downtown girl but in a masculine version, omitting feminine elements such as eyeliner and Mary Janes, and incorporating more hoodies and masculine elements external links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

It is seen similar to Goblincore and Crowcore in that all are associated with appreciating and collecting things of importance. The difference lies primarily in the types of things collected. Goblins collect less-appreciated aspects of nature and crows collect things that catch the eye, while dragons collect \"worthy\" treasures. These can be coins, precious stones, and expensive jewelry, but they can also be things of symbolic or sentimental value. Due to its relatively recent creation, it hasn't yet properly developed the true specific values of what being Dragoncore is, commonly overlapping with other aesthetics, but this can also been seen as a good thing, as there aren't a lot of rules to go by, allowing the people of this aesthetic to express themselves however they like. This is part of why Dragoncore is a favorite of the otherkin, therian and LGBTQIA+ communities, with the themes of not applying to usual gender labels. It seems to have generally a respect of nature and its beauty, and a more elegant, refined well-kept vibe, compared to the messy aesthetic of its counterpart, more dim and darker lighting as well, and an appreciation of draconic artwork and media of all sorts. Dragons are connected to decadence, opulence and elegance. Showing off your collection (be it a hoard of material treasures or one of knowledge) without it being distasteful. The values of Dragoncore are connected to the traits and personalities that are usually attributed to dragons in legends and modern media. This is a list of common fashion items in the aesthetic. It can be separated into two different takes on dragoncore. One is centered around cosplaying and LARPing, while the second includes modern fashion choices that encapsulate the themes and values of dragoncore. Both make use of large amounts of jewelry. (In progress) Silversong101's comment: personally, I see the style as a combination of formal, fitted, and classy attire with biker colors and materials, plus more jewelry. Elemental associations are optional and are not necessary parts of dragoncore.

The group collective consists of Bladee, Thaiboy Digital, Ecco2K, Whitearmor and Yung Sherman — you can find drain aesthetic images tagged with the member's names. Not only music, they were also the trailblazers in visual sense, fashion and lifestyle. Bladee and Ecco2K, are also visual artists, making most of the group's album covers. In addition, they collaborate with Yung Lean and Sad Boys Entertainment, producing songs together and creating merch designs. The group's music videos are often low-budget, edited and filmed unconventionally and use low resolutions, flashing colors and lights, abrupt cuts as well as custom clip art overlayed with the video. Drainers gained popularity through the internet, coming off of a wave of post ironic fashion and music enjoyment. The subculture is said to have started on the 4chan boards /fa/ and /mu/ as well as Reddit, back then the subculture was ironic/a meme and probably just a part of Sad Boy culture. There are some trends that are emphasized by the Drainer subculture: Musically, Drain Gang has been influential in the genres of trap and sad rap, being early collaborators of the collectives Working On Dying and Goth Money Records. Here's a list of affiliated artists: The basis for Drain fashion is inspired by the 90s, especially black fashion and hip-hop. Baggy jeans are a huge focus, as well as hoodies/jackets. It has elements of Y2K, 90s Hip-Hop, streetwear, brown and earthy tones in fashion. Around 2023, Drain Gang would begin experimenting with more androgynous/feminine clothing and aesthetics. Many fit pics of Bladee would be edited to be more distorted or heavenly before posting. Album covers are typified by the heavily distorted collage drawings. Commonly, these experimental, maximalist artworks consist of chroma, cyber overlays, chrome effects, black metal fonts, sparkles, lens flare, and clip art. Their music videos are often low-budget, edited and filmed unconventionally and often using low resolutions, flashing lights/colors, abrupt cuts, as well as custom clip art overlayed with the video, thereby giving off a more amateur-ish and unfamiliar vibe from other artists. Content Warning: The following visuals contain bright colors and lights. This may not be suitable for people with epilepsy and photosensitive sensitivities. Viewer discretion is advised.

Dreamcore shares many similarities with Weirdcore. These images express feelings of familiarity, anemoia, nostalgia and confusion. There are multiple originators for the Dreamcore aesthetic. Most are however not inherently based on the same comeliness. In 2012, a YouTube account called \"GlassBeetles\" or \"L0P0A0G\" uploaded videos reminiscent of its motifs such as cryptic texts, hap hazardous oculus placement and Liminal Spaces. They were created by Sealtoast who mostly is active on Twitter (X). This was the first example of Dreamcore in the video format. Dreamcore’s exact origins are unknown, the direct origins might be tumblr user \"jaaaaaim\" way back in 2018. It mostly gained popularity in the early-mid 2020s with a surge of TikTok videos containing dreamlike visuals. The videos often include original characters that are typically drawn or stitched together with numerous images. These characters usually have objects for heads. Dreamcore, as stated before, is commonly portrayed through images and videos, which utilize different ‘base images’ such as liminal spaces, unrealistic terrain and structures (photoshopped hills, floating buildings, etc.), or even fantasy-like lands,  to give the visual a dream-like quality. Dreamcore visuals are typically lighter-toned and pastel in color, or more bright and vivid. These ‘base images’ are then overlaid with different elements, with the major ones being text and characters. Dreamcore tends to include characters with surreal features. These characters aid in telling a story or creating a scenario that one might possibly see in a dream. They also may include Liminal Spaces. However, the use of characters is not required. Text is also a common element; it ranges from short phrases with very little context to entire conversations or monologues. It’s typically written in a generic base font like Arial, or a serif font like Times New Roman, and can be different colors, sizes and even patterns, depending on what fits the situation best. Text, like characters, is not required. Some other common features of visual Dreamcore are listed below:",

The Dreamy aesthetic can dance between the realms of being somewhat grounded in reality to being so surreal that there's no confusing it with one's state of reality. Dreamy visuals have a very ethereal vibe, which can either be a \"realistic\" ethereal (which can give it plenty in common with Angelcore or Cloudcore) or a \"surreal\" ethereal (which can give it plenty in common with either Synthwave or Vaporwave), but shares a lot in common with the Lo-Fi aesthetic (which has a similarly hazy vibe to it).  What differentiates the two, however, is Lo-Fi deals almost exclusively with the waking world, Dreamy deals strictly with the \"sleeping\" world. Among the many \"dreamy\" styles of music, the most noteworthy is Dream Pop, a subgenre of alternative rock and neo-psychedelia that grew out of ethereal wave/darkwave and developed in the 1980s. The style is typified by a preoccupation with sonic texture and atmosphere as much as melody. It often overlaps with the related genre of shoegazing, and the two genre terms have at times been used interchangeably. Under Construction Hypnocore is a subgenre of Dreamy that relates to surreality and a sense of being controlled, hypnotized, or otherwise losing one's self-control. In terms of visuals, hypno-core often has spirals, moving patterns, eyes, optical illusions, unreality, deja vu, and an undeniable sense of things being wrong. There are several ways to experience hypnocore, just as there are several different views of hypnosis. hypnocore can be experienced in everyday happenings where one is in a trance of sort, such as when reading, driving, or when half-asleep. A darker version of hypnocore can also be experienced in dreams or nightmares that involve doing out-of-character actions, and dreams where one knows they are dreaming but is unable to wake up. Feverdream is a subgenre of Dreamy inspired by the thoughts, sounds, sights, feelings, and emotions caused by a fever dream, or an experience similar to one. A real life fever dream is a dream or nightmare altered by a fever, causing a particularly confusing and bewildering dream at the time, and even more so when remembering it. The Feverdream aesthetic is centered on ideas relating to the experience of a fever dream. Nightmare is a subgenre of Dreamy that deals specifically with nightmares people may have, which can deal with some rather dark and disturbing imagery.  These can be brought up by examples of trauma, feelings of isolation, and unearthly images that can be seen as incredibly jarring - this makes Nightmare similar to Traumacore.

This particular aesthetic can face some backlash due to its seeming-glorification of abusing dangerous substances and getting high by any means necessary, but it is most usually not meant for the general populace to come across, as it's mostly for addicts to share with other addicts. Drugcore visuals will generally include a romanticization of getting high using popular meme fodder and tying it in to drug usage of some kind (like, for instance, a meme that reads \"Keep Calm and Love Heroin\" or \"Don't cry cuz it's over, smile cuz it happened\" attached to an image of somebody shooting up heroin) or images of administering drugs in unorthodox ways (for example, somebody sticking a tab of LSD in their eyeball). There can be some artistic merit in some Drugcore images that borrow heavily from other aesthetics as a means of promoting the usage of these substances (Grunge is a particularly popular aesthetic paired with Drugcore, especially given how Kurt Cobain went out). Sometimes these Drugcore visuals can crossover into the territory of Traumacore when drugs are used as a coping mechanism for past trauma, which can add another level of darkness to the already dark world of Drugcore, because they more often than not acknowledge that their drug usage is self-destructive and some, deep down, realize they need help but others, unfortunately, hope that the drugs ultimately claim their lives to end this misery of theirs; but even then, some of these Drugcore images mentions things like turning up homeless as a result of their addictions, stealing from people, selling their bodies, or doing whatever they have to do to score either money to support their habit or to score the actual drugs themselves. It should also be brought up that it isn't just the usual suspects that one see in the Drugcore aesthetic; alcohol, OTC medicine, nutmeg, and even cigarettes can also get brought up alongside the usual suspects (be it as the focus of the aesthetic or as a side dish to other substances) in sometimes educational ways (for the purposes of harm reduction), but usually it's done in a manner that glorifies substance abuse. While Drugcore was (and still is somewhat) a big aesthetic on Tumblr, it started to work its way over into the world of TikTok as well where users will post videos of themselves getting messed up on drugs or on how to make certain drugs (like DMT) and posting it with the hopes of going viral. A lot of Drugcore fashion will make reference to the user's drug addictions, with a popular look called Heroin Chic, which was popularized in mid-1990s fashion and characterized by pale clammy skin, dark circles underneath the eyes, a very skinny body, dark red lipstick, and an angular bone structure. The look, characterized by emaciated features and androgyny, was a reaction against the \"healthy\" and vibrant look of models at the time.  Drugcore fashion can crossover into aesthetics that have a rather large drug user base such as Raver, Vaporwave, Punk, Grunge/Kinderwhore, and E-People.",

Dual Kawaii (formerly Karasu No Bara) mainly revolves around the feeling of being lost or trapped in the world, feeling tired and dull constantly, a general sense of hopelessness, being dissatisfied with how the world works, and wanting to feel apathy because too many thoughts and feelings have occurred. There is, however, a more optimistic side. It combines self-care, sensitivity, and charm into one aesthetic. It is both pessimistic and optimistic. This aesthetic is a form of healing, trying to find one's self, accept both sides of themselves and come to terms with who they really are. This aesthetic is commonly seen in Melodycore and Kuromicore, which are often combined together as two opposites. There also may be some similarity to Morute, which centers on similar feelings and combines dark and cutesy aesthetics. It is mainly associated with Pastel Goth and E-Girl/E-Kid. The aesthetic can also reflect the dual and, often contradiction, of visual taste between light and dark. This can apply to many variations of aesthetics but is mainly centered around the ones listed. Dual Kawaii is an aesthetic created/identified by Pinterest user @starberrymilkshake on Pinterest. Taking on a blend of black and pink cuteness, it reflects two split personalities and feeling pulled between both; one cute and peppy, one dark and pessimistic. It also consists of self-care mottos and cute designs. It conveys a sense of balance, acceptance of both sides of themselves and an appreciation for both happy and sad things. There are two sides to this aesthetic; a darker, lost sense (which is more edgy), and a lighter side with pastels, cute styles, and a more happy, peaceful sense. The clothing style of Dual Kawaii is open to interpretation, with elements of pink, black, white, and cute motifs, with sayings like 'I am not who I seem to be'.

The genre employs aesthetics and themes typically associated with black metal and applies it to dreamier ambient songs. It has also led to the creation of subgenres such as comfy synth and dino synth. Dungeon Synth uses many aspects of black metal in its visuals. A lot of the members of the genre use corpsepaint and dress in medieval clothes, notably wearing chainmail coifs. The album artwork also typically uses medieval-style paintings, with highly stylized artist name logos similar to black metal. Dungeon synth relies heavily on fantastical and magical elements both visually and musically.

Dungeonpunk is an aesthetic of Sword & Sorcery settings that treats magic as a sort of commonplace technology and/or uses it as a way to peek into the innerworkings of societal problems such as a metaphor for the corruption of power, in short it utilizes the Cyberpunk ethos of using sci-fi technology as a way to reflect on society's problems but switches the sci-fi for fantasy and technology for magic. It is typically used in dark and grim Low Fantasy settings such as The Witcher and Berserk. The now commonplace setting of a dark miserable medieval world in a low fantasy dark setting is a key part of the modern aesthetic and is generally an adaptation of The High Tech Low Life philosophy of Cyberpunk for use in Fantasy settings which can be seen in books such as A Song of Ice and Fire, The Chronicles of Amber and The First Law Trilogy. The history of Dungeonpunk begins, not in the '90s as most people think but in the 1960s and 1970s with The Chronicles of Amber, Elric of Melbinoné, Dungeons and Dragons and the Conan the Barbarian comics. The genre was relatively slow to pick up speed, however in many countries the 'Dark and Brooding' fantasy setting was beginning to pick up in the mid-to-late 80s with one of the originals being The Highlander. Though it wasn't as dark as the new wave of Grimdark Fantasy that emerged in the 1990s pioneered by George RR Martin, the 1990s was a time when Grimdark Fantasy thrived as cult classics with series’ such as The Witcher and Farseer Trilogy. Dungeonpunk typically uses the stereotypical germanic fantasy setting full of green overgrown 'wastelands' outside the cities and concrete jungles surrounded by stone walls with gothic architecture being the typical appearance of the average house. Magic in general tends to be (relatively) scientific like in Berserk and Dying Earth, which lands the aesthetic at a halfway point between Science Fantasy and Sword & Sorcery. A typical portrayal of the genre's aesthetic in the modern day can be seen in media such as The Witcher or Game of Thrones and is almost purely European in nature just like most fantasy works in existence, though traces of stories resembling Dungeonpunk can be found through cultures and religions throughout history and geography. The fashion is what you'd typically expect of a fantasy setting. It's not anything necessarily interesting or unique but tropes are tropes for a reason sometimes. If you want to know more about the fashion just look through any Dungeons and Dragons character art and you'll get a good idea. (Things that are inappropriate for children will be marked as '18+'.) Dunegonpunk was originally inspired primarily by the punk movement and especially the cyberpunk literature movement that, while being explicitly created in the 1980s, had origins in dark speculative sci-fi in the 70s and 60s but rose to cult classic status with the help of the goth movement in the 90s with many of the Grimdark protagonists having studded dark leather armour resembling that of trad goth fashion and actually had some authors that seem to have been active in the goth movement.",

It is culturally influenced by the diverse traditions of the Indigenous populations of Mexico as well as Catholic traditions (such as All Souls' Day and All Saints' Day. It is commonly associated with other celebrations such as Halloween or the Celtic Samhain in popular culture, although in reality they're really different. While deeply rooted in Mexico, Día de Muertos is also sometimes celebrated throughout Latin America, particularly in countries with significant indigenous populations like Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Peru. It is also observed in parts of Central America, northwestern Argentina, and the Andean region of South America. In recognition of its cultural importance, UNESCO declared Día de Muertos an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of Mexico in 2008. The holiday's reach extends further, with celebrations among migrant communities in places like Buenos Aires and among the Kariña people of Venezuela, with dances such as La Llorona. In Spain, Mexican immigrants continue to celebrate Día de Muertos traditions through cultural events. Día de Muertos fashion, also known as Day of the Dead fashion, is a celebration of the Mexican holiday that honors deceased loved ones. It is a time to remember and celebrate those who have passed away, and fashion plays a significant role in showcasing this cultural celebration. Traditional Día de Muertos fashion often includes vibrant and colorful clothing with intricate designs and patterns. Women may wear traditional Mexican dresses called \"zarapes\" or \"huipiles\" in bright colors such as red, purple, or yellow. These dresses are often adorned with intricate embroidery, lace, or flowers. Men may wear traditional Mexican shirts called \"guayaberas\" with pleated details and embroidery. Accessories are also important in Día de Muertos fashion. Women may wear flowers, such as marigolds, in their hair or as corsages. Men may wear sombreros adorned with ribbons or feathers. Skull motifs, representing the sugar skulls associated with the holiday, are also common in accessories such as necklaces, earrings, and bracelets. The makeup and face painting that accompanies Día de Muertos fashion is a key component. Many people paint their faces to resemble decorative skulls, known as \"calacas\" or \"calaveras.\" These face paints often feature intricate designs with colorful flowers, hearts, and other symbols. Overall, Día de Muertos fashion is a vibrant and expressive way to honor and celebrate the loved ones who have passed away. It embraces traditional Mexican clothing and customs while incorporating modern elements and personal style.[plagiarized] [plagiarized]",

The conventional E-Girl takes part in anime, gaming, K-Pop, and underground alternative music circles, although enjoying all of them is not necessary. The E-Girl aesthetic is expressed through assuming an ‘alt’ persona on trending social media platforms such as Tiktok with memes and video formulas. The E-Girl is the opposite counterpart to the Soft Girl (which influences the Kawaii Gamer/pastel E-Girl subtype). While the term E-girl first began to simply refer to chronically online women that grow an audience on social media, the stereotype is that these girls are trying to receive \"clout\" (internet fame) through being sexually attractive, and perhaps by posting \"thirst-traps\" (sexy photos) typically themed after hentai culture. There is significant overlap with the Dark subtype of the Babygirl aesthetic. These young women are mostly from the earlier half of Gen Z. During 2019, when the aesthetic became very popular, they were mostly in their mid-teens to early 20s. E-Girl fashion has developed significant overlap with the 2020s E-Kid aesthetic, though not all E-Girls fit into this newer iteration of the subculture and E-Girls often have more of a focus on sexuality. The classic E-Girl fashion appears very similar to Nu-Goth and Soft Grunge, but takes inspiration from various western and eastern alternative fashions as the style evolves. Many modern versions of the style appear to be a patchwork of many popular alternative fashion genres. Due to the nature of the term, the definition of E-Girl has been constantly changing since its creation in the late 2000s. Initially used as a derogatory label for girls who engage in online gaming, it now describes a contemporary subculture. The shift in its meaning began with the rise of social media platforms, particularly Tumblr and later TikTok, which attracted a predominantly female userbase with a keen interest in gaming. Due to the proximity to gaming, many E-Girls have also become well-known through the Twitch streaming platform, where some have even turned their passion into a livelihood. The first entry for \"E-Girl\" on Urban Dictionary was posted in June 2009 and was originally defined as \"A guy who pretends to be a girl on online communities or games for humor or sexual meetings. Mainly 50-year-old perverts who still live with their parents\".[1] This initial meaning is deeply rooted in the tongue-in-cheek adage that \"there are no girls on the internet\". The definition of E-Girl described young girls partaking in online spaces in unfavorable ways from 2013 through 2016.[2] E-Girl culture and its visual motifs were influenced by multiple subcultures and trends prior to the popularization of the TikTok definition and image of the term. Many of the fashion pieces were taken from 2000s Alternative subcultures that have a greater music component. For example, fishnets and bondage accessories, Goth and Mallgoth inspired fashion, striped socks and pleated skirts from 2014 Tumblr Soft Grunge, checkerboard and plaid from Skater, etc. One of the most direct inspirations is the tumblr Pastel Goth community, which also utilized influences from above but did not utilize ecchi imagery. The Weeaboo/Otaku subculture, popularized in the West in the early 2000s, also was an influence. Maid uniforms, cat ears, large eyes, and blush high on cheeks are popular fashion and makeup elements in Moe and fan service in anime. Many girls also try to resemble these Moe and ecchi characters, as explained in the visuals section, which leads to overlap with the Neko aesthetic. There is a lot of Kawaii influence(especially dark kawaii and Dual Kawaii), especially with characters like Kuromi. The current definition of E-Girl became more prevalent during 2019, with the definition of E-Girl being changed to \"Girls [that] are usually teenagers and think they’re edgy. They wear long sleeves, under short sleeves, and sometimes their outfits don’t match [...] they usually wear vans, beanies, chains etc.\"[3] The E-Girl as an online subculture became more popular in 2019, corresponding with this change, and its aesthetic has become incredibly popular on TikTok. The E-Girl became a meme, with multiple people who are not in line with the values and hobbies of E-Girls making videos where they \"try on\" and parody the aesthetic. Most popular was the \"E-Girl Factory\" format, where a young woman begins with normal clothing, before being transformed into an E-Girl.[4] The culture and interests of E-Girls, as well as its current popularity, can be attributed to the greater mainstream interest in things typically seen as for \"nerds,\" such as video games, anime, and East Asian culture. In the early 2000s, people interested in these things being seen as unattractive, socially stunted, and esoteric. But as the Internet became more popular and Asian media more accessible to Westerners, the stigma dropped. However, some people in these hobby communities still differentiated themselves from the more \"casual\" enjoyers of the medium (e.g. an anime fan with 100+ watched vs. a person who only watched Demon Slayer). This often has a sexist connotation, as the things more popular with women were not considered the \"serious\" part of the hobby. As the E-Girl trope became more popular, many adult creators utilized the components in their content. For example, these women would cosplay, pose with plushies, do the ahegao, dye their hair, etc. This is often associated with the site OnlyFans. The most important part of E-Girl culture is the genuine passion for video games, anime, and other nerdy internet hobbies, which were traditionally dominated by men. E-Girls may develop an edgier or tomboyish persona to exist like \"one of the boys\". Others would utilize cutesy and nerdy feminine aesthetics, such as using a Kawaii Gamer PC, to appeal to nerdy men. These personas develop specifically for the purpose of finding acceptance or tolerance in a space that would otherwise be hostile to them, as the gamer community is infamous for its misogynistic additudes and stereotypes about female gamers.[5] Like other nerds, their focus is to become better or have more expertise in their hobbies, dedicating much of their time to video games or anime. However, as noted by many journalists, E-Girls resemble more a persona, rather than a subculture. This means that rather than behaving a way in real life or in private, the E-Girl aesthetic and behaviors are only carried out online, such as in Discord calls, Twitch streams, or TikToks[6]. E-Girl behaviors such as making the ahegao face, behaving like an anime woman, speaking in a baby voice, or wearing uncomfortably revealing clothes run counter to behaviors in offline, non-sexual situations. Part of the E-Girl stereotype is that she directly panders to her nerdy male audience or gamer \"simps\" (males who act overly sympathetic to non-reciprocating women). This is often done to gain money, clout, or to simply have men buy video games for her[7]. The E-Girl style is an aesthetic that emerged from the digital realm of social media platforms, particularly TikTok, blending influences from anime, gaming culture, and elements of 90s and early 2000s fashion. This style is renowned for its bold, expressive, and individualistic approach to fashion, celebrating self-expression, inclusivity, and online subculture. Another part of the fashion can be attributed to the high presence of Japanese pop culture on the internet. Outfits inspired by anime characters are also very common among E-Girls. The fashion worn by E-Girls is stylistically very similar to the various darker alternative fashions.  An E-Girl's wardrobe is usually characterized by oversized band tees, cargo pants, chunky shoes, and a plethora of accessories such as chains and chokers. Predominantly are printed tops in black, pleated skirts, chain accessories, chokers, and platform shoes. Hair can range from one's natural color to vibrant hues, often accessorized with clips and beanies. It's a blend of the rebellious spirit of punk with the cuteness of kawaii culture, making a distinctive and modern statement. E-girls will often style their hair into various and trendy hairstyles such as pigtails/twintails, space buns, straight bangs or having dyed hair/streaks; accessories like hairclips or scrunchies can be added. In addition, just as much value is placed on individuality. Makeup trends in this style often feature heavy, winged eyeliner, reddened or sickly eyeshadow with dark circles (or vibrant eyeshadow), extending the bottom of the eye with mascara, horizontal blush across the nose, and painted hearts or stars on the cheeks or near the eyes. This section describes the media that E-Girls interact with, rather than there being this type of aesthetic within the media. Artists engaging in the E-Girl aesthetic include: E-Girls tend to fall into Japanese otaku circles, enjoying anime media and maybe even cosplaying anime characters for conventions and outings. They may enjoy K-Pop or K-Beauty, frequenting general East-Asian media communities. In addition to eastern media, E-Girls may enjoy alternative music, becoming a part of many music-based western subcultures like Goth, Grunge and Emo. A lot of E-girls are also gamers and may be irl streamers or vtubers on Twitch or YouTube. Many E-girls can be found in Discord communities, tending to stay in each other's company without branching out into other subcultures. However, E-Girls can be found in any online community due to the broad nature of the category. The Pastel E-Girl is a type of E-Girl that lacks the dark/alternative style seen in the main E-Girl aesthetic. It is essentially the same as the Kawaii Gamer aesthetic, except that the Kawaii Gamer aesthetic is less focused on fashion and more focused on gaming devices. This subtype is mainly inspired by the Babygirl, Erokawaii, and Soft Girl aesthetics. Soft E-Girl, aka Dark Soft Girl, is a combination of the Soft Girl and E-Girl aesthetics. See main page Due to the popularity of East-Asian pop culture within the aesthetic, there has been an issue with \"Asian fishing\" with E-Girls, meaning changing one's facial features with the help of make-up in order to appesar ethnically East Asian to a degree. For example, making eyes appear more slanted with the help of eyeliner. Asianfishing, alongside their obsession with Japanese and Korean media fuels stereotypes and encourages fetishization of East Asian features and culture. E-Girls(much like Jirai Girls) have the added stereotype of either being generally mentally unstable or being diagnosed with a mental disorder. The stereotype depicts these women as hot but crazy, and often places E-Girls with mood disorders such as depression, bipolar, or BPD within the femme-fatale archetype. The fetishization of these women actively hinders education about the unpleasant realities of dealing with mental illness, and may push such vulnerable women into relationships that objectify them sexually due to their mental diagnosis. Additionally is the criticism of the negative label of adult E-Girls for their edginess and sexual nature. The demonization of women who do not express themselves in a conventional manner, i.e. by engaging in niche communities or by simply developing an online persona, may be interepeted as a form of misogyny, especially due to these women being called \"fatherless\" for seemingly arbitrary traits such as being alternative. What may additionally be seen as misogynistic is the negative treatment and harrassment of women expressing their sexuality in any form, with women online bearing the brunt of sexual harrassment for simply showing their face, much more so for any suggestive or provocative content they may post. E-Girls are often conflated for women in the sex industry and are targeted as such, with sexual harrassment often dismissed as \"coming with the territory\". Another strong point of criticism is the hyper-sexualization of teenage girls that occurs in the form of viral memes. For example, erotic dance moves from the Me!Me!Me! MV, a song based on porn addiction, became a popular trend in the late 2010s, with many of those participating being underage. The labeling of these underage girls as E-Girls is additionally detrimental for their safety due to the fact that this label inherently sexualizes them. What is also damaging is the fact that these girls have unrestricted internet access and can access such material in the first place. Unsupervised teenage girls are at high risk of being targeted for grooming by older men who abuse their developing sexuality for their personal pleasure.

Prevalent in the mainstream from roughly 2008 to 2013, it partially overlapped with the Frutiger Aero aesthetic. The term was coined by designer and celebutante Steves Peeps on the social networking website SpaceHey in 2021. Following Timbaland's tremendous success in the 2K7 era (2006-2008) with Justin Timberlake's FutureSex/LoveSounds album, pop music and high fashion began to head in a more up-tempo direction. The origins of Electropop 08 are often traced back to Lady Gaga's The Fame album, which came out in 2008 and became a hit in 2009. This aesthetic prevailed in music videos as well as fashion, and often contained traces of Electroclash, Avant-garde and Indie Sleaze. Electropop 08 started to decline in popularity in 2013-2014 with the rise of Electronic Dance Music (EDM), which would become ubiquitous during the mid-late-2010s.

It generally revolves around the themes of vulnerability, heartbreak, and self-discovery often reflected in music and art. The meaning of the term \"emo\" has undergone significant changes over the years, leading to varying definitions depending on the context and time period. In the 80s, emo first developed in the D.C. hardcore punk scene from the straight-edge scene as a name for the fans of the music genre known as \"emotive hardcore\" or \"emocore\" in short. The hardcore punk scene of that time was dominated by a \"tough guy\" mentally, and a whole new scene emerged - aka \"Revolution Summer\" - as a protest from violence at local shows. People started to use the term \"emocore\" to distinguish bands from that scene from others. Not only most of them were against violence and drugs, their music became more challenging and, actually, it was not just hardcore - they were pioneering in post-hardcore. They were adding emotional lyrics to the more melodical hardcore punk sound. The songs are commonly dealing with past, loss and angst, and are characterized by overly dramatic vocals, akin to crying or screaming. While the initial genre is still not forgotten today, it's more obscure then other subgenres. Over a decade later, the word has been adopted by a new generation of emotional music within the hardcore punk scene and spawned a cultural phenomenon that is known as the nowadays emo subculture. Just like how punk itself has changed over the years, emo also has evolved to beyond the initial version, but still firmly holds on its roots in emotional music within the hardcore punk scene. Also, different \"eras\" were distributed by \"waves\" - commonly, there are four of such. Emo often somewhat overlaps with other subcultures visually, such as Goth (much to the chagrin of the Goths, who absolutely detested the Emo Kids at the time of their rise in popularity, likely due to the confusion between the two scenes) and Scene, due to dealing with negative emotions as its major topic. Obvious connotations to negativity and cynicism are a common theme in many of the visuals, and often reflected in the form of texts. Characters are usually looking a bit empty or spaced out, saying lurid things. Common motifs also include broken hearts, skulls, guns, splatters, and music notes. It also overlapped and continues to overlap with animecore and weeaboo due to the popularity of anime among many emos. Anime fan emos tend to listen to many diverse genres of rock and metal moreso than other kinds of emos. Another notable example of Emo visuals is the typical art style that they shared in common with the Scene subculture in the 2000s to early 2010s. The style is characterized by its often sketchy line art. This may be to mimic traditional pencil drawings, or to create a jagged, edgy feel to the artwork. The proportions of the characters were usually thin or stick figured bodies with caricature-like heads and large eyes, comparable to the likes of Tim Burton or the character L from Death Note. The large circular \"blank\" eyes are reminiscent of a particular \"chibi\" design style that was popular during the 2000s. The overall appearance of the characters is heavily based on on the popular trends of scene during its peak, meaning straightened opaque high-volume hair, black tees with splashes of bright colors, low waist bottoms, stripe pattern details, and sneakers. Outfits are dark and mainly consist out of band tees, skinny jeans, oversized hoodie jackets, and Converse or Vans shoes. Some of the more popular accessories are razor blade necklaces, rubber bracelets, stripe arm warmers and tights, as well as studded belts that often feature a check pattern. In the past, the most common places for people to shop were Hot Topic and Claire's, but since the rise of the internet among the mainstream, online shopping has become more popular. Many members of this subculture will also spot various body mods, the most popular ones being stretched ear lobes, facial piercings, and tattoos. The hair is usually kept long regardless of gender and features side-swept bangs and choppy layers, usually dyed in a deep black color, occasionally with additional colorful sections or streaks. Black eyeliner is iconic for the makeup and sometimes enchanted further with a matching eyeshadow. Emo aesthetic is all about expressing your emotions through dark and edgy fashion. Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect emo look: Remember, emo aesthetic is all about expressing your emotions through fashion. Don't be afraid to experiment and mix different pieces to create your unique emo style. Embrace the darkness and have fun with your fashion choices! Besides the original Emocore, many other types of punk subgenres have become associated with the subculture due to the vague definition of the initial genre. Most of the music consists of bands that sing and/or scream about the various emotional hardships in everyone's life, and the vocals are often combined with harsh guitar riffs and heavy drums for the typical sound. Many subgenres have developed over the years, which can be found below. Emocore is a type of post-hardcore, but more emotional and somewhat melodical. Also known as \"Revolution Summer\" or \"first wave\". Notable bands include Rites Of Spring, Embrace (US), Moss Icon, Gray Matter and Dag Nasty. This term was highly rejected by the bands, but now it is used to distinguish them and emo bands of other waves. Often considered the more light-hearted, math-rock influenced variant of Emo, Midwest Emo tends to go for more of an Indie/Geek vibe than the darker, angsty Emo original recipe. 90s stuff is commonly known as \"second wave\", and 10s or 20s - \"fourth wave\" or \"(midwestern) emo revival\". Emo-pop is a genre combining emo and pop-punk. Emo-pop features a music style with more concise songs and hook-filled choruses. Well known emo-pop bands are Fall Out Boy, Paramore, My Chemical Romance and Panic! At The Disco. This music genre is not the same as emocore. However, one can still identify as emo if they tend to listen to more emo pop, since emo-pop is a type of emo music. Also known as \"third wave\". Screamo (also referred to as skramz) is an aggressive subgenre of emocore that emerged in the early 1990s, emphasizing \"willfully experimental dissonance and dynamics\". Screamo is strongly influenced by hardcore punk and is characterized by the use of screamed vocals. Lyrical themes usually include emotional pain, death, romance, and human rights. Popular bands in Screamo include: TBA External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

The genre itself surged in the 1920s as a reaction towards the taboo topics of Japanese society; combining the elements of eroticism (ero) with grotesque imagery (guro). [1] Ero-Guro art can be divided in various styles; some artworks are more similiar to Japanese folk art, while some have more in common with modern anime and manga, and some artworks are more shocking than others. This art movement has inspired various other aesthetics, including Angura and partially Breakcore. Ero-Guro surged during the 1920s-1930s as a reaction to the subjects that were deemed taboo in the Japanese society of the time. Ero-guro artists sought to challenge societal norms and explore taboo subjects through their artworks and written literature. It was a time of social and political tension in Japan, particularly because it was the Interwar period. It was influenced by various artistic movements such as German Expressionism, Surrealism, and the decadent literature of Europe, as well as traditional Japanese folk art.  The movement was infamously considered controversial and even faced repression and censorship during World War II, but it re-emerged during the Postwar period, particularly in anime and manga. Ero-Guro often features explicit or suggestive sexual themes and can range from nudity and sexual acts to depictions of various fetishes. However, it isn't always the central focus but rather an element intertwined with elements of horror, the macabre, and the grotesque. This is not limited to but also includes depictions of mutilation, disfigurement, bodily transformations, and sometimes extreme violence or disturbing scenes. There is a frequent use of surreal or dream-like elements in Ero-Guro, blurring the line between reality and fantasy. It makes the works appear bizarre, abstract, or fantastical, with the purpose of challenging the viewers perceptions. There are many stark contrasts, vibrant colors, and exaggerated features to create a visually striking and impactful aesthetic.",

The term, coined in 2005, is a fusion of ero (shortened from the English word \"erotic\", which has negative connotations in Japanese culture) and the lighter kawaii, meaning \"cute\". Unlike previous erotic trends in Japan, it was created by women for women and gave a sense of empowerment as Japanese women were able to claim ownership over their sexuality in a way that catered to female tastes rather than male sexual desire. The babygirl aesthetic is highly inspired by erokawa. Nowadays, the term is mostly associated with adult content aimed at women that is heavily inspired by kawaii culture. The term was first used in public by the Japanese singer Kumi Kōda to describe her artistic style. Many Japanese women considered the word ero as something negative but found it acceptable to associate the word with kawaii. Further variations were created such as erokakkoii (エロかっこいい, \"erotic cool\") and Erokakkokawaii. With the increasing popularity of the singer in the following years 2006 and 2007, the term spread more and more artists such as the korean singer Ayumi Lee or Leah Dizon described Kumi as their influence in relation to fashion.

Being related to the more recent Bohemian style, it creates a mixture of ethnic patterns, textures, raw materials and various natural colours and incorporates them into modern Chic fashion. It's meant to create a sense of harmony and cultural diversity. An important part of the Ethno-Chic style is \"storytelling\" through objects and visuals, as the elements used often carry an important cultural meaning.   Generally, Ethno-Chic can take inspiration from the visual elements of any culture, however cultures deemed \"exotic\" are the most commonly used. Because of this, this aesthetic mainly takes inspiration from African countries and Indigenous American communities, as well as India. However, it's important to note that Ethno-Chic does not authentically represent the cultures it takes inspiration from; it is supossed to be a multicultural aesthetic rather than a representation of the actual thing. The Ethno-Chic style was started by various members of the Hippie community in the 1960s, when many travellers from first world countries returned with exotic items, patterns and accessories from some of the most culturally diverse continents in the world[1]. The Ethno-Chic style was created as a reaction to the exclusion of exotic cultures and inspiration from Western fashion, and was associated with the countercultures of the time. \nSo, the origins of Ethno-Chic could be traced back to the Orientalism movement during the 19th Century, when many people from the Western world became fascinated with the cultures of the Middle East and Asia. The Ethno-Chic interior design is characterized by its fusion of traditional ethnic elements with contemporary design. It draws inspiration from various 'exotic' cultures around the world, incorporating their unique aesthetics, patterns, colors, and textures into modern spaces. Therefore, this style could be described as an 'harmonious blend of old and new'.   \nThe furniture choices play a huge role in Ethno-Chic decoration: traditional pieces from different cultures are often used, such as hand-carved wooden furniture from African countries or woven rattan furniture from Southeast Asia. fabrics with ethnic prints or textures are commonly used. These elements when combined with modern furniture, can create a balanced look between tradition and modernity, as well as creating a culturally and visually diverse enviroment in a room.   \nAnother key element that makes Ethno-Chic what it is is the usage of handcrafted items, preferably made by people from the cultural backgrounds the items belong to. Handcrafted items such as pottery, baskets, masks, sculptures, and wall hangings can be displayed as decorative elements in Ethno-Chic interiors. Ethnic art, including paintings or prints depicting scenes from different cultures can also be incorporated. Natural elements like plants, dried flowers, and woven baskets add a touch of organic beauty to the space.  \nThe colour palette commonly used in this aesthetic typically includes brown, orange, green and red. Ethno-Chic can be described as a fusion of traditional ethnic designs with contemporary fashion trends, resulting in a unique and eclectic aesthetic. Ethno-Chic fashion draws inspiration from different cultures, including African, Asian, Native American, Middle Eastern, and Latin American cultures. Ethno-Chic designers and fashion brands often incorporate traditional textiles, patterns, colors, and craftsmanship techniques into their clothing pieces. The most used colours in Ethno-Chic fashion are any natural colours. \nImportantly, one of the key aspects of Ethno-Chic fashion is its emphasis on cultural appreciation rather than appropriation. Its purpose is to promote the knowledge and empowerement of historically marginalized cultures by incorporating their traditional elements respectfully and with permission into modern fashion. This is reflected in how the clothing is made, as Ethno-Chic fashion designers often collaborate with artisans from various cultural backgrounds. Additionally, Ethno-Chic has become popular in some oriental countries, like India or Sierra Leone.",

Expressionist artists have sought to express the meaning of emotional experience rather than physical reality. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas. The style originated principally in Germany and Austria. There were a number of groups of expressionist painters, including Der Blaue Reiter and Die Brücke. Expressionism developed as an avant-garde style before the First World War. It remained popular during the Weimar Republic,  particularly in Berlin. The style extended to a wide range of the arts, including expressionist architecture, painting, literature, theatre, dance, film and music. The term is sometimes suggestive of angst. In a historical sense, much older painters such as Matthias Grünewald and El Greco are sometimes termed expressionist, though the term is applied mainly to 20th-century works. The Expressionist emphasis on individual and subjective perspective has been characterized as a reaction to positivism and other artistic styles such as Naturalism and Impressionism. Among the poets associated with German Expressionism were: German expressionism was an early twentieth century German art \nmovement that emphasized the artist's inner feelings or ideas over \nreplicating reality, and was characterised by simplified shapes, bright \ncolours and gestural marks or brushstrokes.

Fairy Academia is a feminine, otherworldly offshoot of Dark Academia, inspired by the popular children's novels and illustrations from the 19th and 20th centuries as well as the general themes and visuals of Victorian and Edwardian childhood. The main inspiration comes from the concept or belief in English/Western European folklore, particularly fairies and their relationship to children. Key inspirations of the aesthetic are derived from Cicely Mary Barker's flower fairy illustrations, which remain popular with modern children because of picture books like Fairyopolis or with collectors of Barker prints/novelty home ware. Other artists that depict similar fairies are also included, as well as depictions of the fairies from the works of William Shakespeare, such as Titania, Oberon, and the fairy kingdom in A Midsummer Night's Dream or Ariel in The Tempest. Fairy academics enjoy learning and education, as well as trickery and scheming - as in the 1917 Cottingley Fairy hoax, where two young girls used trick photography to con the populace into thinking there were real fairies in their garden. Fairy Academia is an aesthetic that was created by wiki user Fairypage. It is a combination of an identified series of inter-related events and design movements, but was named as an aesthetic in that the categories relating to lifestyle and associated music are unrelated to the original Victorian/Edwardian time period, such as the grunge elements listed below.

Visuals include nature, soft pastels, butterflies, magic, flowers, soft animals like bunnies, and the vibe of springtime. Fairycore usually features feminine visuals and styles, and the more masculine equivalent/subtype is Elfcore( as traditionally, elf is a masculine term and fairy is the feminine term). Any and all fey-like creatures from mythology around the world are included. This ranges as far and wide as Celtic, Scottish, Nordic, German, French, Native American, Japanese, Chinese, etc. It includes the typical Fae and fairies (usually from Scottish Seelie and Unseelie) as well as various kinds of elves, nymphs, shapeshifters (like swan maidens/men), and various other creatures. It is most similar to Cottagecore, Pixiecore, and Goblincore. The term was coined by an unknown Tumblr user. The aesthetic is popular with fairykin, people who incorporate the concept of fairies into their personal identity. Although it is similar to many nature based aesthetics, some say it is the feminine equivalent to Goblincore. This is debatable, because fairycore focuses on the beauty of nature, such as flowers, fairies, dresses, and femininity, while Goblincore is more based on appreciating the not so pretty parts of nature, like mushrooms, bugs, dirt, etc. Since the mid-Victorian period, there has been a fairy fandom. During this time period, countless ballets, operas, books, poems, and an entire sub-genre of artwork (Victorian Fairy Painting) were spawned from this obsession with “Fair Folk” that lasted until World War II. Yet while the stoic realism of years to come left a hole in the adult side of Fairy for a long time, the rise of fantasy during the 80s brought back the fandom. Brian and Wendy Froud, Alan Lee, and Charles Vess were artists of massive importance in the scene, particularly for their influence on literature and film. Authors like Terri Windling, Charles de Lint, Emma Bull, Patricia A. McKillip, Diana Wynn Jones, Robin McKinley, Ellen Kushner, Neil Gaiman, and many others revitalized Faerie by taking it into urban environments. A few key films like Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal, and Legend helped change the view of fairies from tiny pixies into strange and inhuman creatures. Books like War For the Oaks, Jack the Giant-Killer, and Borderland took fairies out of their unknown realms and brought them into 80s era musically-inclined America and Canada, thus pioneering Urban Fantasy and Mythpunk. This fandom moved into comic books in the 90s thanks to the teaming of Charles Vess and Neil Gaiman in Sandman: A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Stardust. After a brief lull, the early 2000s brought Faerie back full-force. Faerie Magazine (now Enchanted Living) and Faeriecon brought fans of fairies, mermaid, and other related creatures together. YA writers like Holly Black, Julie Kagawa, Laini Taylor, and Maggie Steifvater, although their work was less literary and more teenage, revitalized the 80s scene for a whole new generation. Kid's fare like Winx Club, Barbie in Fairytopia, Bratz Fashion Pixiez, and Tinker Bell/Pixie Hollow were mixed in their views of fairy. They either brought back fairies to the tiny Victorian ideals or embraced Urban Fantasy’s view of them as mysterious “Fair Folk” that could walk amongst humanity virtually unseen. In more recent years, Holly Black, Cassandra Clare, and especially Sarah J. Maas have brought attention to the idea of “The Fae”, influenced by older Scottish and Irish mythologies much as the 80s authors were, only humanizing them. Yet while this has influenced a massive amount of Fae-centric romance novels, there has been some mild backlash. More and more modern writers (like Erin A. Craig and Joanna Ruth Meyer) have been returning to the idea of Fairy as inhuman and embracing darker, horror-inclined themes. Photos used in this aesthetic are often edited to have soft but vibrant colours. A blur and/or sparkle effect is also very common. Small amounts of collaging may be used to paste wings, flowers, mushrooms, etc. onto the photo subject.[1] It’s important to realize that it is visually multifaceted. Some prefer the pastels, sparkles, and \"The Fairies\" while others are more into earth-tones, foliage, and \"The Fae\", and these are equally viable. Motifs included in this aesthetic: Fairycore fashion is inspired by artistic depictions of fairies, so outfits usually have a Ethereal vibe, with heavy Cottagecore and nature inspiration. Faecore fashion includes: Fairycore enthusiasts often try to decorate their habitat in line with the chosen aesthetic. Similar to fashion choices, they favour maximalistic approach with lots of knick knacks and rustic vibe[2]. Common décor choices include: In terms of room décor, fairycore often overlaps with witchcore, cottagecore, and goblincore. Fairies, or people who are fairycore, often have nature-related or crafty hobbies such as: Unlike Strega (closely related to Ethereal Death), Dark Fairycore has no connection to the Goth genre of music. Like Fairycore, it's mainly a literary and artistic movement throughout the many facets of the fantasy genre. However, it is similar in its imagery and content. Dark Fairycore typically encompasses the visual works of Brian and Wendy Froud, as well as the Victorian artist John Anster Fitzgerald. Books would include much of urban fantasy aka Mythpunk, particularly the works of Neil Gaiman and other 80s to 90s authors in the genre. If Fairycore is Seelie, Dark Fairycore is Unseelie. If Fairycore is represented by Tinker Bell, Dark Fairycore is better displayed by Maleficent. Typically, the fairies of Dark Fairycore are human-sized instead of tiny. They are inhuman, a bit more antagonistic, and typically referred to as Fae. Their imagery is darker, stranger, and moodier, like deep forests after rain or a tangle of thorns surrounding a single rose. Goblincore is a more grungy take on Fairycore. It's based off of goblins and gremlins, which are fantasy creatures like fairies, but are more dirty and rough. It is debatable whether or not Goblincore is separate from Dark Fairycore or whether it is simply another name for the same aesthetic. See: Pixiecore See: Spriggancore Cottagecore is an aesthetic based off of country living, nature, plants, etc. On the TikTok platform, common themes are mushrooms, frogs, and forests, but is still slightly different from Fairycore though it's debatable; some say Cottagecore is the same as Fairycore but without the magic. Mermaidcore is an aesthetic based off of the mythical creature the mermaid. Unlike Fairycore, Mermaid visuals surround the ocean and aquatic life as opposed to the earth. Under construction (see main page) Under construction (see main page) There is no specific Fairycore music, as it is mostly a literary and artistic genre. Regardless, folk music particularly has a long history of chronicling fairy ballads of Ireland and Scotland, as does the work of Celtic singers.

Western culture has tropified imagery associated with circuses because of media and the traditions associated with going to these events. These spectacles tend to be seen as outdated forms of entertainment with a folkish, almost tacky connotation. This is due to the fact that circuses were popular during the early to mid 20th century. Tradition has kept the visual imagery, with all of the events established during the Victorian era in P.T. Barnum's circuses. Past circus practices are also now seen as antiquated and abusive; lion-taming, seal clowns, and freak shows leaves a bad taste on modern audiences. They also are not as easily amused by clowns, \"kiddie\" rides, and live events, leading to decline. Circuses may also have elements of fantasy. In fiction, it is not uncommon to have a circus be hiding the fact that the performers have actual magic powers that allow them to perform their stunts. So, the aesthetic can gain some mystique and elegance, with jewel-toned costumes, charismatic and flirtatious personalities, and an attractive form of danger. Carnivals and circuses are two distinct types of spectacles, but have been associated with each other because they often overlap. Circuses put out rides in order to attract a wider audience and carnivals typically have stage shows that are the same as circus acts. Their temporary nature also forces them to use the same kinds of stands and tents as each other, and they also use the same type of imagery to bring excitement. Note that this aesthetic excludes amusement parks, water parks, and magic shows. Those are more permanent locations and have aesthetics that are more refined, put-together, and do not have the same visual tropes as fanfare. Circus acts and carnival attractions typically are seen as separate and evoke different emotions that are amplified with costumes, stage presence, and color scheme. In fanfare, all of these elements are combined, creating a varied yet cohesive aesthetic that utilizes this large range of different positive emotions to amplify the novelty associated with fanfare. Foods included in this aesthetic are foods that are commonly found at carnivals. Including, but not limited to: Dark and creepy carnivals/circuses are one of the most popular interpretations of the genre. People like to subvert the cheerful elements and emphasize the mystery, occult, and distrust associated with the carnies. The vintage nature of these events also lead to a run-down and decaying appearance. In this dark interpretation, the performers are depicted as malicious or troubled. They may utilize their talents for evil, such as magicians keeping guests trapped to experiment their acts on or clowns being insane ax-murderers. Supernatural beings, such as ghosts, monsters, and vampires may be running the event, intent on eating, haunting, or torturing the guests. Neon and electric aesthetics are a popular contemporary aesthetic of the funfair (it is the traditional format, not contemporary circus). Many modern carnies have decided to partly break away from the primary colors of their profession to renew interest in the public. Here, the tents and stands are neon and glow-in-the-dark. Space and alien imagery is popular, with shows that are free from the outdated attractions of before. Trapeze acts, arcades, and rides are more prominent, with the events only operating at night. Pastel fanfare emphasizes the daytime, vintage, and lighthearted elements. As the name suggests, the images are more pastel with antique Rococo details. The most popular attractions here are carousels, Ferris wheels, dancers, horses, and clowns. There are also illustrations and statues of performing seals and bears with cute hats and pastel accessories. Sweets such as cotton candy and strawberry desserts are one of the most common photographic subjects. Circus-themed fiction is one of the most popular ways of consuming the aesthetic and reinforces many of the emotions and visual tropes described above. Circuses are often accompanied by a certain kind of music, often a cheerful, fast-paced march played by a big band. Brass instruments, drums, and the Calliope are the instruments that compose circus bands.[1] The most prominent composer is Henry Fillmore, who served as a circus bandmaster and composed many of the famous songs typically associated with circuses today.[2] External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

The movement clearly broke from Impressionism, as well as other traditional techniques, with its use of bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors.[1] Fauvism was heavily inspired by van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, and Paul Cézanne; it was led by Henri Matisse and André Derain.[2] In contrast to Impressionism, which regularly featured light brushstrokes, Fauvism featured thick brushstrokes that created a flat picture made up of fragments of shapes.[3] What appeared in art was simplified forms of real life, which further emphasized art as being upon a flat surface.[4] Another important aspect of Fauvism was the use of vibrant colors, which were often taken straight from a tube of paint. Colors did not need to correspond to real life; instead, they were based on the artist’s feelings and experiences. This use of color thus emphasized mood.[5]. In the early 1890s, Henri Matisse and other future fauvists came to the studio of the symbolist painter Gustave Moreau to learn. Here are some of the influential names: A cyclist, an erotic writer and a violinist in his spare time. He dumped colors onto a canvas as if no tradition had existed before him. His landscapes and portraits defy the logic of reality with resounding fillings, schematic figures and a violence that acted as a counterpoint to the busy study of his friends, who, despite exalting the bright colors they distributed to give them hegemony in their perfect spatial distribution, did not allow nothing random. He followed a path of his own that did not stray too far from the route traced by Picasso, his future rival, who wouldn´t have come Primitivism that led to Cubism without Derain's advice to visit the Museum of Man. The funny thing is that between 'The bathers', very sculptural, by Derain, and 'Las señoritas de Avignon', by Pablo Picasso, there were only a few months and both did not know what the other was doing. Braque, who travelled to Paris to get the title of broad brush painter, was one of the last to arrive to the movement and one of the first to walk towards abstraction. Without wanting to, its landscapes became more Cezanian and augured a new course that took shape after 1907, when after another Autumn Salon each of the members of Fauvism took their own journey. In his beginnings he practiced Realism, with a traditional style and made copies of masters from the Louvre Museum. He was influenced in his painting by Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Persian ceramics, African art and Moorish fabrics. The most characteristic features of Matisse's style are summarized in his personal appreciation of color in relation to the line, in his way of synthesizing figurative elements, in his contempt for the representation of classical space, and in the undulating arabesque rhythm that prints to many of his most characteristic compositions, related to the symbolist painting of his master Moreau and Art Nouveau. His compositions show an exquisite care, he believed that colors should express feelings and convey emotions. \"I do not literally paint that table, but the emotion it produces upon me.\"",

These young women use anime and manga as escapism from their lives, typically as mentally ill NEETs with no real life social circle or romantic partner, although this is through an internet persona rather than necessarily having to actually take place in reality. The majority of femcel weeaboos mostly use Tumblr and Twitter, where they post photos of Japanese media and memes (typically centered around mental illness and existential dread). Those who participate in the Femcel Weeaboo subculture usually share a very specific taste in anime and music; they often identify with and relate to fictional characters from anime shows and video games that have \"messed up\" backgrounds or characters that exhibit traits of mental disorders, including but not limited to: Serial Experiments Lain, Needy Streamer Overload, Evangelion, WataMote, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, etc. As for the musical aspect, some genres widely listened to by the Femcel Weeaboo community are Indie Rock, Breakcore, and Lolicore. The people that express this aesthetic combine multiple disparate elements that express feminine interests, otaku culture, and depictions of mental illness. For example, a blog may contain things that show a weeaboo lifestyle back-to-back, or in phases. These images tend to be of more candid quality, with the lighting being harsher and more blue, as it is less polished in appearance. The more kawaii-oriented side of the aesthetic may pair these themes with girly imagery, cursive texts, pink pastels, kawaii mascots like those on Sanrio products, and soft colors. The images posted often are edited with anime girls and male love interests from popular anime. Due to the popularity of nostalgic 90s anime within the community, art posted in femcel communities tend to have edgier tones attatched to a typical cute moe archetype. Sketchy lines and rendering, harsh black-white contrast, and dark themes (self harm, ero-guro, denpa media, drug use, mental illness, etc.) are added in conjunction with an old school loli-esque art style. This art style is popular amongst lolicore music artists. Exaggerated references to early internet culture, particularly the more controversial corners like 4chan, are very common among the aesthetic. However, this is despite the fact that many participants in this community are too young to have experienced early days of these websites firsthand (often ironically referred to as \"LARP\" or \"live-action roleplay\", as it is seen from a point of view of anemoia). This trend of 4chan-inspired content, filled with specific meme references and anime characters that were common in those image boards back in the 2000s, seems to have been popularized by an artist called Lottie (also known as \"canihavepromo\"). Her content gained notoriety on TikTok for its inspiration from 2000s anime as well as old Flash animations from 4chan, which were pretty accurate for that era considering the fact that she was only 16 years old and never actually used the forementioned website, although she was subsequently deplatformed for her problematic behavior and other controversies involving her. The criticism of this aesthetic is similar to that of Waif, however the Femcel Weeaboo aesthetic focuses more on fiction than real life and is less likely to discuss the topics surrounding anorexia and eating disorders that are way more prominent in the Waif community. An important shared interest of this community is early internet meme culture originating from websites like 4chan and other taboo topics like manipulation, gore and pedophilia. For instance, there were many controversies in TikTok over a trend of femcel weeaboos creating catfish accounts and calling themselves \"IRL lolis\" (\"loli\" is a word in Otaku culture which serves as a kinky word for young female anime characters, generally considered inappropiate due to its association with pedophilic content). This is also reflected in its association with Lolicore, which although not inherently sexual, is a subgenre of Breakcore and J-Core music very popular among the Femcel Weeaboo community. Another common topic of the aesthetic is gore, often portrayed in a similar way to Cutegore. These topics are often used as a form of venting or frustration with trauma, and mirror the psycho-erotic horror seen in Denpa media and other cerebral forms of horror. The connection between Femcel Weeaboos and the controversial Incel subculture as a whole is loosely defined due to the recent surge of this aesthetic, though incels themselves often believe that women are incapable of experiencing the same situations as them, \"inceldom\" or \"involuntary celibacy\", which they describe as the state of being unable to find a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one, thus fully excluding women from their community and negating the existence of femcels. The anime and manga watched by this community tends to fall into either a darker tone that is notorious for 90s denpa or psychological horror and the philosophical issues presented in them, or anime that heavily uses moe tropes. Most anime that people of this subculture make memes and jokes featuring characters from is Neon Genesis Evangelion and Serial Experiments Lain, however most anime made in the early 2000's to late 1990's can be featured. The more kawaii-oriented side of the aesthetic features series from shojo and idol anime, video games and visual novels targeted at girls. These are often from music-related games like Project Sekai or Love Live!, but other series are also popular. Femcel Weaboos tend to identify with the following fictional characters:",

People who adhere to the Femme Fatale aesthetic try their best to embody the traits of the classic femme fatale archetype, which leads to a lot of crossover with the Baddie aesthetic; one of the key differences between the two is the Femme Fatale has an air of mystery and elegance to her, whereas the Baddie follows a more \"what you see is what you get\" philosophy (combining the two leads to the Cherry Emoji Twitter aesthetic). Femme Fatale also influences Dark Coquette, with the latter having more of a youthful Nymphet vibe to it. The Femme Fatale (also referred to as a Vamp,[1] Maneater, among several other titles) is a stock character that came into prominence with the film noir movie genre and dime novels of the 20th century. The most prominent codifier is Brigid O'Shaughnessy in the most famous film noir, The Maltese Falcon (1941), in which she uses her beauty as a distraction and murders the protagonist's partner.[2] Femme Fatale means Fatal Woman in French, referencing the actions of this character trope. These days, there are also most male characters in media that break the gender stereotypes and embody the \"Femme Fatale\" trope too, starting from the late 10s/early 20s with which they can be referred to as the \"Homme Fatales\". A Femme Fatale embodies the seductive and mysterious traits of a woman, normally avoiding giving information about themselves. Femme Fatales are typically not the emotional type and tend to keep their emotions outwardly neutral and ambigious. They normally don't have long relationships but if they do their significant other is either her partner in crime or her submissive(or both). Their main goal is to entice and use. Femme Fatales have to be smart, quick witted, and independant. If a Femme Fatale seduces and then kills several men, she becomes a Black Widow. A femme fatale will be known to wear dark, sexy, well-cut and form-fitting clothes. Black, dark reds, dark emerald, and dark blue are commonly seen colors in the femme fatale wardrobe, outfits being largely monochromatic, patternless, and smooth. A powerful sense of self and a sharp mind are just as important accessories as any dress. Pair your look with high heels, walk in like you're the hottest person in every room, and you're well on your way to embodying the spirit of the femme fatale. Music for this aesthetic is based on the personality traits of the femme fatale. Genres for this aesthetic are diverse and can be from the perspective of the femme fatale or someone who encountered a femme fatale.

The main reason why this style emerged were poor architectural fixes in the region. The style is characterized by the co-existence of various architectural styles without harmony (often being akin to Brutalism, although not classified as such), mixes of various materials (resulting on poor quality), lack of a \"start\" and \"end\" in architectural pieces, unfinished constructions and unnecessary ornaments. On social media platforms such as Instagram or TikTok, some Galician users made aesthetic edits out of Feísta buildings as a joke because many people found it similiar to Soviet Brutalist buildings, which were often featured in the Doomer aesthetic. Feísmo became prevalent in Galicia sometime around the 1960s. Surprisingly enough, this style doesn't originate from poverty - it emerged during the \"Spanish Miracle\", a period when the poorer regions of Spain such as Galicia could finally develop a better economy. Curiously, many buildings that ended up looking like this were actually pretty wealthy projects. Feísmo actually emerged as a result of poor regulations in constructions, a lack of interest for Galician traditional architecture and a lack of interest for finishing projects. During the same decade, many Galicians also immigrated to other countries, especially to South America, which would mean that many architectural projects would remain unfinished because it was hard to know who started them or owned their rights. Some projects were even unnecessarily elongated, resulting in them never being completely carried out. However the emergence of this architectural style was noticed some years earlier, and it was called out as a problem for the first time by the Asambleia Nazonalista de Lugo, a former group of Galician regionalists who fought for the culture and language of Galicia. In 1994, an association of 48 architects was formed to replace Feísmos in Galicia and make new buildings with traditional materials and elements. In 2003, Feísta architecture became the most reported problem to the Xunta (Galicia's autonomous government). 1 year later, a campaign against this architectural style was formed in the city of Ourense. In 2023, multiple towns received funds to restore architectural problems and poorly built houses. Nowadays, Feísmo can be found throughout most of the region and is far from being gone. This style isn't as prevalent in major cities such as A Coruña or Santiago, but can still be seen in certain districts.In many Galician municipalities, unfinished Feísmo buildings have been repainted with murals and art (See Gallery). Carballo is one of the most notable towns for doing this; it's home to multiple several street art murals, some of which are considered notable worldwide. The most common characteristics of Feísmo include: Feísmo emerged in a pretty rough era for Galicia. Many inhabitants of the region had lost their interests for preserving the traditional architecture of the region, and many of them didn't actually care about finishing their architectural projects such as homes of buildings. Along with that, there was a mass wave of immigration to South America (particularly Argentina and Uruguay), which only made the problem worse. A common mentality many Galician people held during the decade can be described with the phrase \"ti vai facendo\" (roughly translating to \"go do something\") - this resulted in a lot of unnecessary houses being built just for the sake of building them, even if there was never a real necessity to do so. The lack of architectural regulations at the time also contributed to the phenomenom. Feísmo is obviously widely disliked in Galicia, as it ruins landscapes and takes up space in towns, and it has constantly been reported as a problem since the 1960s. Feísmo is also criticized for being a problem exclusive to the region, because according to architectural experts and sociologists, there's not similiar phenomena anywhere to be seen in its neighboring regions, such as North Portugal, Asturias or León, or even in Brittany, a nearby region of France which has a similiar climate and cultural background. Various groups and artists are looking forward to renovating Feísmos with either art or actual Galician traditional architecture.",

The artists of the Figuration Narrative movement sought to create a type of art that incorporated influence from New Figuration and contradicted Abstraction by managing to tell a story through their artworks; hence why it was named \"narrative figuration\" by the French art critic Gérald Gassiot-Talabot in 1962. \nOutside France, Figuration Narrative also holded popularity among Spanish artists during the 1970s, as means to combat censorship through art. Figuration Narrative was developed through the vision of various Parisian artists during the decades of the 1960s and 1970s, which were very complex periods of recent history, including the Cold War, and some events in which France was directly involved, like the war in Algeria and Vietnam. These artists rightfully felt like society was too stressed with the tense political climate of the time, and consumerism kept growing bigger, including fields like cinematography, cinema, art, comics, bandes desinnées, and even art movements like Pop Art or Nouveau Réalisme. Much like New Realists, they developed their own movement that incorporated elements of real life and everyday situations, but unlike them, they rejected consumerism, making \"art for the sake of art\" and making any artwork that could be deemed philosophically \"meaningless\".

They were known for their short skirts (here meaning knee-length) and above-shoulder-length hair. They also listened to jazz. Smoking, drinking, driving automobiles, and casual sex were another part of the lifestyles of Flappers. Essentially, Flappers made their disdain for socially-acceptable female behavior known. Flappers came out of the increasing freedoms throughout the 1910s. Due to large numbers of men fighting in WWI, a significant number of women entered the workforce, exposing them to freedoms that many wanted to keep. Women's freedoms were further expanded with the passage of the 19th Amendment, giving them the right to vote. Improvements in birth control also contributed to the growing freedoms of women.[1] Then the men came back from war. As Frederick Lewis Allen says in Only Yesterday, \"(Women) found themselves expected to settle down into the humdrum routine of American life as if nothing had happened, to accept the moral dicta of elders who seemed to them still to be living in a Pollyanna land of rosy ideals which the war had killed for them. They couldn't do it, and they very disrespectfully said so.\"[2] In summary, flappers defied the previous norms by wearing short(er) skirts, makeup, and having short hair. Examples of flapper clothing include: This is a list of activities commonly associated with Flappers. This is a list of general places where Flappers went.[4] Flappers were known for listening to jazz.",

It is characterized by sleek, smooth, minimalist, and organized technological design and function. The website user interfaces are ideally created with multiple accessibility functions to aid user experience (especially on a small smartphone screen), such as easily readable fonts, high contrast/dark mode options, and rounded shapes to reduce visual load. Flat Design had its roots back to the 1950s, influenced by the International Typographic Style (Also known as Swiss Style) that emerged in Switzerland. It also took cues from the styles of Bauhaus from the 1920s, and Memphis Design from the 1980s and 1990s. Flat Design dates back to 2008, when PepsiCo redesigned their Pepsi products to have more minimalist logos. It further developed in 2010, when Microsoft started experimenting with the Metro UI design seen on Windows Phone 7, and later in 2011 with a new Xbox 360 Dashboard. These early uses were examples of Flat Metro (a Frutiger Metro subgenre), the precursor to Flat Design. Flat Design wouldn't begin to gain notoriety until the Early-2010s, when gradient-based skeuomorphic Frutiger Aero-esque design philosophies began to disappear from tech design, in favor of cleaner looks via Windows 8 and iOS 7. Many websites, software, and electronics by corporations in the 2010s to 2020s have these minimalist elements, such as Google, Discord, Twitter, Apple, etc. Flat Design slightly inspired Android societal elements in the video game Detroit: Become Human. In 2017, an aesthetic known as Corporate Memphis appeared, combining elements of Corporate and Flat Design. Many years of Flat Design have reached a level of boredom for the general public, so much so that in 2021, memes about \"oversimplified logos\" appeared as a precedent, including the Neumorphism and Glassmorphism trends in Mac OS Big Sur and Windows 11 respectively, recovering gradients and shadows. Flat Design reached its cultural peak and use in 2021. Although starting in 2022 and 2023, there would be a strong decline in Flat Design. Flat logos have begun to be left behind in favor of more detailed logos. For example, in March 2023, Nickelodeon added an orange splat to its logo to pay homage to its previous logos while still maintaining the 2009 wordmark. Later in the year, Reddit also joined in, transforming Snoo into a 3D style with a more expressive face, designed by Pentagram. It's rapid decline continues well into the mid-2020s will likely be completely replaced by Glassmorphism and Neumorphism around 2025-26. As mentioned above, the visuals of Flat Design are intended to reduce visual load and increase accessibility. This also entails limited color palettes with low to medium-high saturation accent colors to minimalize eye strain. Flat Design usually avoids earth tones. Blue and white is a commonly used color combination in this aesthetic due to its clean and fresh feeling and prevalent use in web design. Easily decipherable icons are also common. It is not necessarily futuristic or utopian, such as in Cyberprep, but it can be. Although it is used by major tech companies, it also doesn't have to be tied to corporatism or businesses. The primary focus is the minimal distraction, ease of access, and streamlined processes of technology. Cyber minimalist fashion often overlaps with minimalist fashion with its smooth fabrics and limited colors, however cyber minimalism has less excess material and fits closer to the body. It is not tight to the body, but it has less bagginess than some minimalist fashion. It tends to not have patterned or textured fabric, but it is acceptable in moderation. There are few accessories as well, usually gold, silver, or black, fitting in with the minimalist fashion. Music that relates to Flat Design has light synths, smooth song structure, and is easily listened to. There is not often heavy bass, and harsh or loud noises are not present at all. It may or may not have lyrics.",

Flop TikTok humour centers around internet memes and cultural events, commonly using Generation Alpha (or Gen Alpha) as a main object of ridicule. Jokes involving Gen Alpha slang, media, and trends are extremely prevalent on Flop TikTok, with content poking fun at Skibidi Toilet, Sephora Kids, and slang like \"mewing\", \"rizz\", and \"sigma\". Flop TikTok also jokes about different types of people, such as Pick-Me Girls, Golden Retriever Boyfriends, and Players. Satire TikTok videos are posted, often in the form of Point Of View (POV) videos. For example, a TikTok could be posted with a caption such as \"POV: Your Golden Retriever Boyfriend finds you in a parking lot\" and would be a video over-emphasizing the, often negative, qualities of a Golden Retriever Boyfriend, or whatever the specific character type is.

It involves seeking new food experiences as a hobby rather than simply eating out of convenience or hunger. The Foodie aesthetic, however, is dedicated to showing off these foods in very aesthetically pleasing manners. You may also take note of the color combinations, plating arrangement, and composition in their photographs. There are also multiple ways of engaging as a foodie, with different cuisines, trends, and likes. Multiple social media circles and cultures have content relating to food, and how the different foods are photographed and framed will also differ. Most foodie shows provide a strong emphasis on food. Be it cooking shows, shows that involve a host traveling to different locales to sample the food of a particular restaurant, reality shows centered around cooking, or works of fiction centered entirely around food, such as the anime Food Wars or the Jon Favreau movie Chef. On top of this, there are several popular YouTube channels that Foodies will watch what generally falls into the same category as examples mentioned above of shows and movies. Bakery is a subgenre of foodie based around bakeries, bread, and confectioneries from bakeries. There is potential for it to cross over with Lovecore (because what says \"I love you\" more than fresh baked goods). There's even a mild home for Bakery aesthetics with the various Academia aesthetics because what better way to help you focus on studying (besides some chill music) than some baked goods and coffee? Candycore is an aesthetic that involves bright clothing, bright colored bracelets and other accessories, braided and brightly dyed hair. Candycore also includes raving, childish things, and types of candy. For more information on this subgenre, please check out our Candycore page. Fruitcore is a subgenre of foodie that revolves around fruit, berries, and dishes made of them. Gummywave is primarily associated with partially translucent edible/seemingly edible objects that are visually related to gummy snacks. These include fruit snacks, gummy bears, gummy worms, sour straws, and Gushers. One of the most popular types of food content is \"unhealthy\" food, typically associated with American sports bar and grilling culture, served in excess. This includes bacon, burgers, macaroni and cheese, deep-fried foods, barbecue, nachos, etc. These foods will have multiple elements combined with each other, like a burger with macaroni and cheese on it, for example. The food is also typically served in an impressively large quantity. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

It is similar to cottagecore in its high regard for nature and mutual support. However, forestpunk is less restrictive of technology, particularly solar-powered items. Forestpunk also diverges from other related aesthetics in its inspiration & timeframe. Where Cottagecore is derived from a romanticization of a European rural lifestyle, forestpunk-like styles have and still are present in several cultures around the world. (Examples include the Nordic, Uralic, Roma, Celtic, Siberian, Austronesian, Subsaharan, Aborigine, and Native American peoples.) As long as there's a forest element to it, you've spotted a good inspiration, be it clothing or farming. While the examples mentioned earlier are good guides, take a look at the image on the right for more modern inspiration. For example, a cabin in the middle of the woods, surrounded by vines & trees, living off rainwater & produce, feeding toads & deer while collecting their bones for decoration. Or, an apartment with solar panels with plants dotting the walls, rocks & buttermoths moving around, buying locally & dressed in greens & light browns. Goals are not only flexible, but each person makes their own based on acting feral and surviving in the wild. There is some overlap with Cryptidcore due to the more feral nature of the aesthetic, Mossy for obvious reasons, and Goblincore due to the recollection of mosses, rocks, and plants used for decoration (in non-harmful ways to the environment) being a widespread practice. Like with Cottagecore, there is a certain set of lifestyle aspects that go hand-in-hand with the aesthetics, such as: The last three are of particular importance, as environmental preservation and restoration are two of the original reasons for the creation of the term 'forestpunk.' Dark greens, browns, and (some) light blues are quintessential to the clothing style associated with this aesthetic, with baggier clothing items being a suggestion but not a must. Some items to base a wardrobe are: Fur clothing is not unheard of, but because of the importance of being in harmony with nature, faux-furs are the preferred option. Light pendants are optional, and can be substituted with round, solid-color earrings (usually black). While a forestpunk living space itself is ideally a treehouse, this is not necessary, and an earthy vibe can be achieved with the correct placement and styling of furniture and other trinkets. Colours to include are those from the clothing style, though white is more present to give harmony to the walls and ceilings. Things to consider when decorating a room are: Acoustic instruments are common but not necessary. Guitars & relatives are common, coupled with nebulous lyrics (though lyrics themselves are not necessary). As with literature, woods & similar themes are common. Analogies are often used (again, with references to bones or nature). Overall, as long as it gives a certain boscage vibe, it can be described as forestpunk. Some examples of such songs are: Usually, settings involving the woods are most of what you'll need for your forestpunk-themed literature. Alternatively, plots relating to hunts or some other dark, foggy plot starters are good calls. Categories include, but are not limited to, mystery, fantasy, & history. Here are some examples: Because of its greater focus on ecology & sustainability, forestpunk is invariably linked with green politics and environmental movements, as well as various equality movements. Forestpunk, like most other aesthetics based on nature & mutual aid, is related to anti-capitalist and anarchist movements, particularly green anarchy[Footnote 1] and indigenous movements. Equality is fundamental to forestpunk, and discrimination is heavily opposed in the community, with a clear distancing from supremacist & \"traditional value\" groups.",

It's categorized by the use of nature, low quality image montages, Chinese knockoffs and imagery. On January 2, 2023, a Reddit user named u/williamsaguaro2002 had a dream related to Walt Disney Studios and Frutiger Aero. In that dream, the user got a voice acting job at Disney for a \"big purple fish\" character, but the studio was located on a underground secret base, which had aliens and nuclear weapons. Later, he stumbled across an old Asian man talking about \"Fotonight Web\", alongside a image associated to it above, although he doesn't remember what the senior said. On January 3, 2023, he made a post on Reddit (see here) illustrating what he saw in his dream and later detailing what happened in it.

It is a subgenre of Superflat Pop and Frutiger Aero and prominently consists of the colors electric lime, sky blue, hot pink and neon orange. This color palette and the visuals of the aesthetic overlaps with Bright Tertiaries, which uses tertiaries colors like teal, lime green, and orange or fuchsia, as well as flat humanist designs. Four Colors is popular in Japan with stores and brands such as Daiso, Sony and Fujifilm. Four Colors' roots dates back to the Late-1990s, forming as parts of Superflat Pop, Y2K Futurism, and primitive Frutiger Aero. During this primitive period, Four Colors was primarily used for different-color variants of videogame consoles, primarily the Nintendo 64. Four Colors' prime began in October 2003[2] when Apple began the \"Silhouette\" iPod advertising campaign. Apple reportedly spent $49.6 million on the ‘‘Silhouette’’ campaign between January and August of 2004, being majorly influential on Four Colors' widespread success and adoption in the West. Four Colors continued to be heavily popular during the \"Frutiger\" time period, generally seeing increased use in consumer technology (eg. iPod, Wii, PlayStation 2, 3, etc.) as well as miscellaneous advertising. Four Colors continued to be popular until the Mid-2010s, when the Frutiger Family of aesthetics were in decline. Companies began focusing more on Flat Design and being uniform, omitting the personalization and eye-catching color combinations. By 2017, Flat Design and other aesthetics such as Corporate Memphis had completely phased out Four Colors, giving way to a new era. The Alpha Kids from the webcomic Homestuck might reflect Four Colors, with each color designated to one of the four kids: Jane (Blue), Jake (Green), Roxy (Pink), and Dirk (Orange). Four Colors still sees varied degrees of success in Japan and is still relatively popular despite its decline in the West. The visuals of Four Colors consist of flat visuals that predominantly use four colors: Electric Lime, Sky Blue, Hot Pink, Neon Orange; this coincides with the colors of different seasons in Japan. Four Colors can also host a wider range of colors too, forming a rainbow. However, the main colors are usually the ones mentioned above. These visuals are often utilized in conjunction with consumer products or corporate designs. Four Colors is also sometimes featured in videogame box-art.",

Overlapping with the McBling and Electropop 08 aesthetics, it is characterized by its vast use of Skeuomorphism, glossy textures, cloudy skies, tropical fish, water, bubbles, glass, lens flare, sprawling patterns, \"humanism\", aero glass, bokeh, Frutiger fonts, Abstract Tech, auroras and bright, vibrant colors (usually greens and blues). This aesthetic was originally unnamed at the time, being more associated with specific styles (e.g., Windows Aero, iOS's skeuomorphic icons, and the visuals of Mirror's Edge and Spore) rather than a broader aesthetic. Some referred to it as \"Web 2.0 Gloss\" during the time when the aesthetic was mainstream, however it was mostly used as an adjective to describe the glossy elements of Frutiger Aero rather than the aesthetic as a whole. The term \"Frutiger Aero\" was coined in 2017 by Sofi Lee of the Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute and went viral in 2022, leading to renewed interest in the aesthetic. Frutiger Aero contains many sub-aesthetics/related aesthetics; these include, but are not limited to: Frutiger Metro, Technozen, Frutiger Eco, and Helvetica Aqua Aero. Frutiger Aero is named after Adrian Frutiger (who created the Frutiger fonts commonly used alongside Frutiger Aero) and Windows Aero (the UI theme of Windows Vista/7), which spread outward and influenced many other companies' design choices the era. The earliest signs of Frutiger Aero appeared in 2001 with the releases of Microsoft's Windows XP and Apple's Mac OS X 10.0. The \"Bliss\" desktop background of XP and the skeuomorphic design of OS X (itself was derived from early versions of iMovie) have been noted by some as precursors to FA, though both have also been categorized as part of the Y2K Futurism era. It was also at this time that Microsoft began development of Windows Longhorn (later renamed Windows Vista), with elements of what was to become the Windows Aero theme gradually being added. The mainstreaming of Frutiger Aero began in Late-2004 with the releases of Windows Media Player 10 (featuring design ideas found in Longhorn), the start of the Seventh Generation of Video Game Consoles with the Nintendo DS (first to kick off this generation, despite the Y2K-esque and Technozen-esque designs) and the PlayStation Portable (XrossMediaBar, in development since the PSX in 2003), and Apple's iPod \"Silhouette\" advertising campaign (Four Colors). Frutiger Aero began to become more common in 2005 and 2006, with the release of Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, Longhorn Build 5048 (the first build where the system's entire UI was Aero), Windows Vista Beta 1, the Xbox 360 (Blades Dashboard), Nintendo DS Lite, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo Wii. By 2007, with the release of Windows Vista (retail version), the first iPhone (iPhone OS 1.0), and Mac OS X Leopard (10.5), Frutiger Aero was completely established. As the Y2K Futurism aesthetic was fading, the nature-oriented designs were seen by some as \"humanizing\" tech and making it more accessible to a wider audience, in comparison to the edgier and Sci-Fi designs of Y2K Futurism and Metalheart. During Frutiger Aero's prime, most advertising, media, stock imagery and technology released during this time embodied the aesthetic or was heavily influenced by it. Frutiger Aero also shares similarities with the Y2K Futurism aesthetic and is considered its successor, as it shares a similar bright and glossy futuristic look, albeit in a more refined, corporate form. It was also concurrent with the McBling, Surf Crush, and ElectroPop 08 aesthetics, and overlaps with them with varying degrees. During this time, various sub-aesthetics began to arise due to the Frutiger Umbrella becoming increasingly broad in nature. In 2012, the skeuomorphic look of Frutiger Aero (i.e. Windows 7) started to fade in favor of the Flat Design look (i.e. Windows 8/10). Nintendo's Wii U (2012) was the last videogame console that used Frutiger Aero in full. However, the Wii U was a commercial failure, only selling 13.56 million units, further contributing to Frutiger Aero's demise. In some cases, companies switched first to Frutiger Metro, then to Flat Design. By 2013, Flat Design began overshadowing Frutiger Aero, the release of iOS 7 being the most major example of this. In 2017, a minimalist web/tech aesthetic appeared known as Corporate Memphis, officially symbolizing the death of Frutiger Aero. However, there are still some areas where Frutiger Aero is used today, especially in retail boxes for medical and cleaning products, as well as school textbooks, and in TV Channels to a limited extent (e.g. The GMA Logo from 2011-Present in The Philippines, CPC Kazakhstan (until 2017), Belarus-1 (Until today) and Russia-1 (Until Today)). Frutiger Aero is still used in News Intros, especially in the \"Вести\" News Idents, of Russia-1, and TVR Telejurnal in Romania, in a small amount. The term \"Frutiger Aero\" was coined by Sofi Lee of the Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute in 2017, leading to a gradual increase in interest in the aesthetic.[1] Since late 2022, it has made a comeback via TikTok videos in the form of nostalgia, with the hashtag \"#frutigeraero\" being used over 30 million times[2] with Frutiger Aero effects or filters. In August 2023, a TikTok post specifically about the aesthetic was posted on the official Windows TikTok account. Furthermore, some believe Windows 11 is related to Frutiger Aero or contains a successor-aesthetic (Glassmorphism), as seen in this promotional material. On Ukrainian Wikipedia, a full article has appeared describing Frutiger Aero, including a history, visuals, and list of uses section. In the \"Legacy\" section of the Windows Aero Wikipedia article, Frutiger Aero is recognized to have existed. The section features a small description of the aesthetic describing its visuals and history. Aero's resurgence is similar to the Y2K Futurism revival, a phenomenon that has occurred since the Mid-Late 2010s. Given this Neo-Y2K trend, it is also likely a \"Neo-Aero\" movement is currently underway or will be underway in the future. This is an example of the \"20-year nostalgia cycle\", as Frutiger Aero began triggering mass-nostalgia for people around 18 years after its emergence. Key elements of UIs that use Frutiger Aero include linear gradients (typically seen on buttons and navigation bars), bloom/glow, and a shine/sheen on many elements in effort of making them look 3D and realistic. Frutiger Aero visuals, at first glance, can be mistaken for simply being the Y2K Futurism aesthetic in action, but the biggest difference is that the images tend to have higher-definition visuals and less primitive 3D visuals compared to most Y2K imagery (largely due to Frutiger Aero emerging just as HD video began to become popular). The visuals of Frutiger Aero somewhat lack the \"anything goes\" mentality often associated with the Y2K aesthetic (i.e. the \"Green Head\" of Windows ME's Media Player), going for more of a refined look. The Frutiger Aero look is often considered the \"halfway point\" between the busyness of the Y2K Futurism era and the minimalism of the Flat Design/Corporate Memphis era. Common motifs associated with Frutiger Aero are Skeuomorphism, glossy textures, \"humanism\", use of nature, bokeh, bubbles, Frutiger fonts, glass, and auroras. Some Frutiger Aero designs prominently use the color blue to mimic the ocean or to resemble Abstract Tech, while others go for a green, more nature-like approach. The Frutiger time period encompassed the zeitgeist of the Mid-2000s (2004) to the Early-2010s (2013). Frutiger Aero and its related aesthetics/subgenres encompassed and dominated advertising, stock imagery, technology, web design, branding, and media during the period it was mainstream. The Frutiger era succeeded the Y2K Futurism era and preceded the Flat Design era, often being considered the middle ground between the two. Frutiger Aero itself is increasingly broad leading the internet to assigning sub-categories to it to better understand it and its intricacies. Frutiger Aero images centered around environmentalism and nature have come to be known as Frutiger Eco. Frutiger Eco is a broad sub-aesthetic of Frutiger Aero. It focuses on renewable energy, living in harmony with nature, while also incorporating futuristic themes and architecture centered around nature and sustainability. Frutiger Eco was a popular aesthetic prevalent in images, advertising, graphic design, etc., of the Mid-2000s to Early-2010s that tried to spread awareness of climate change while also encouraging optimism in the form of images portraying a utopian, eco-friendly and advanced future; these motifs are similar to Solarpunk and Cyberprep. Frutiger Eco is separated from these aesthetics as it more falls in-line with the visuals and history and of Frutiger Aero. Frutiger Eco's name comes from its father aesthetic, Frutiger Aero, and the prefix (not used as a prefix in this context) \"eco\", meaning ecology or the environment. Helvetica Aqua Aero (also known as Frutiger Aqua, Aquacore, Low Frutiger, or simply Helvetica Aqua) is a Frutiger Aero and Y2K sub-aesthetic characterized by its use of imagery related to the sea, the ocean and beaches. Common imagery includes aquatic life, bubbles, water, aquatic colors and other key elements of the ocean. Helvetica Aqua combines this with shared elements of Y2K and Frutiger Aero such as gloss, futurism, 3D rendered objects, Early-2000s imagery, and gradients. Due to this, it is considered the halfway point between Y2K (1997-2004) and Frutiger Aero (2004-2013). Frutiger Aurora is a subgenre of Frutiger Aero that focuses on the aurora visual; an aurora is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky. Frutiger Aurora emerged in the Early-2000s towards the end of the Y2K era and maintained its popularity into the Early-2010s. Dark Aero, also known as Mata Nero or Frutiger Ego, is a sub-genre of Frutiger Aero popular from c. 2006-2015. Dark Aero uses a darker color palette contrasting the depth-filled colorful motifs characteristic of Frutiger Aero. This gave the aesthetic a more simplistic look, which lead to it still being used after Frutiger Aero's decline. Another one of Dark Aero's main signature characteristics is aero glass. Dark Aero can be described as the middle ground between Frutiger Aero and Skeuomorphism due to its Frutiger Aero-esque imagery combined with Skeuomorphism's color palette. Whilst Frutiger Aero was more commonly used for mass market and commercial products, Dark Aero focused on high-end and enterprise-oriented items and services. Dark Aero was also commonly used for modern tech such as smartphones, computers, TVs, cars, etc. Technozen (also known as Techno Kawaii Zen, or alternatively Yuki) is an aesthetic primarily inspired by the aesthetics of Mid/Late-2000s Japanese technology. It can be described as cold, sterile, and professional looking, and at the same time, cozy, friendly, and cute. It is the Japanese counterpart of Frutiger Aero and it is described as a sub-aesthetic of it; however, Technozen is largely evocative of Asian design while Frutiger Aero is more global. Technozen was also popular in the realm of music, examples including the Wii Main Menu Music (2006) and Golden Sky by Jan Cyrka (2008) featured in the \"A Day Made of Glass\" videos. Four Colors was a frequently used color scheme found in consumer products and consumer technology during the Mid-2000s to the Early-2010s, first primarily seen around 2004 as a part of Apple's iPod \"Silhouette\" advertising campaign. It is a subgenre of Superflat Pop and Frutiger Aero and prominently consists of the colors electric lime, sky blue, hot pink and neon orange. Four Colors is popular in Japan with stores and brands such as Daiso, Sony and Fujifilm. Four Colors' color palette is also noted as being a reference to the colors of different seasons in Japan, specifically: Pink = Spring, Green = Summer, Orange = Autumn, and Blue = Winter. DORFic (also known as Sunshine Polypunk or PolySunk) is an aesthetic featuring Abstract Tech-esque minimalist imagery that was popular from the Mid/Late-2000s to the Mid-2010s. DORFic is an acronym for daylight, orange, futurism, and the last 4 letters of the word \"graphic\" (simplified to \"Fic\"). This aesthetic is a subgenre of Frutiger Aero, Abstract Tech, and can be compared to Stecffism (Frutiger Eco subgenre) due to their shared element of being corporate. Vectorgarden (formerly known as Floral Metro) is a subgenre of Vectorflourish, Frutiger Aero, and Frutiger Metro. It is characterized by minimalist abstract flourish patterns, flowers, auroras, butterflies, bubbles, as well by the heavy use of gradients, transparent, and glossy textures. Vectorgarden was popular between the Mid-2000s and Early-2010s, sharing a lot of overlap with Frutiger Aero since they share many of their visual motifs such as humanism, nature, auroras, and glossy textures. Bright Tertiaries is a broad aesthetic, graphic design style and interior design style originating in the Mid-2000s alongside contemporary and visually similar aesthetics such as Frutiger Aero, Frutiger Metro, and Four Colors. It was used for several purposes (mostly by corporations), being incredibly popular during its era. It was utilized for interior décor, architecture, graphic design, clothing, consumer electronics, and media. Bright Tertiaries is primarily centered around a tertiary color palette (lime green, fuchsia, orange, and teal). It began to fall out of mainstream use in the early 2010s, design trends experiencing a major shift from Frutiger-esque maximalist designs to Minimalistic philosophies such as Flat Design. Frutiger Metro (also known as Flat Frutiger Aero, Vector Metro, or Vector Vomit) is a broad aesthetic that encompasses the \"Frutiger\" vector-based graphic designs of the 2000s. These designs share a lot of similarities with Frutiger Aero and other aesthetics of the time. Unlike Frutiger Aero which contains large amounts of depth and texture, Frutiger Metro is flat. Its name comes from it's cousin-aesthetic, Frutiger Aero, which it bears a heavy resemblance to; the second part of its name, Metro, is derived from the Metro design language created by Microsoft which was utilized in Windows 8 (Frutiger Metro's most prominent appearance). This is similar to Frutiger Aero being named after Windows Aero (featured in Windows 7). Some consider it a sub-aesthetic of Frutiger Aero. However, Frutiger Metro's increasingly broad nature distinguishes it from Frutiger Aero and establishes it as an aesthetic in its own right. Unlike with the Y2K Futurism aesthetic of the Late-1990s and early 2000s, which movies, TV, music, and video games of a science-fiction persuasion were based around, there was less overlap between this aesthetic and popular culture. It was and is mainly a corporate design philosophy. The Hexatron aesthetic, with its focus on dark surfaces, UI and the huge emphasis on blue color, eventually edged out Frutiger Aero to become more popular. Because of its bright and minimal design, Frutiger Aero was heavily used in casual play videogames such as Wii Play and Purble Place. Portal, Mirror's Edge, Spore, and The Sims 2 & 3 are notable and popular examples of the aesthetic in the AAA gaming world (the latter three being published by Electronic Arts). Engines like Unreal Engine (used in Mirror's Edge) and the Source Engine (used to create Half-Life 2, Portal, Garry's Mod, TF2 etc.) frequently employed design elements similar to Frutiger Aero. Elements of Frutiger Aero are scattered around internet fiction, too. For example, the Zoeific Biopolity from Orion's Arm does not have one aesthetic, given that many trillions of people live in it, but its logo could be considered Frutiger Aero. It is somewhat an authoritarian surveillance capitalist empire based on environmentalism and 2000s-era right-wingers, but is generally portrayed as good in the setting. Another example is Homestuck's Jade Harley, a character who likes nature and technology, similar to Frutiger Aero's core philosophy. This aesthetic was used in the technology and visual design of the time and is often associated with iOS 1 to 6 and the early days of Web 2.0. It can be difficult to discern what type of music falls under the Frutiger Aero category and is ultimately up to interpretation. Examples of sounds and music that could be considered to be part of the genre show up all over advertising and media from 2004-2013. Take note of the sounds used in games, movies and television shows of the time like the classic iPhone ringtone and the Wii Menu Theme. The Wii Menu Theme in particular can fall under the Technozen subgenre. The sounds present in 2004-2013 pop culture as well as modern examples of Frutiger Aero adjacent music include marimbas, piano, violins, chimes, synths, samples, distortion, speed and pitch changes (nightcore & daycore), bitcrush, MIDI and heavy bass. Genres like Vaporwave, Trance, Techno, EDM, Ambient, Synthpop, Electroclash, Digital Hardcore, Hyperpop, Bubblegum Bass, PC Music, Vocaloid, Utopian Virtual, Seapunk, Cloud Rap, Jungle, DnB, and Breakcore all have songs that resonate sonically with Frutiger Aero's aesthetic. The use of airy pads, gentle synths, soft new age vocals and electro/IDM palettes was seen in the mid 00s wave of Downtempo as more producers moved from hardware to purely digital software production, giving it a cleaner brighter digital sound. The resurgence in Frutiger Aero's popularity in the Early-2020s led many musical artists to release work inspired by the aesthetic. Most of these albums fall under one of the genres listed above.

Frutiger Eco's name comes from its father aesthetic, Frutiger Aero, and the prefix (not used as a prefix in this context) \"eco\", meaning ecology or the environment. Frutiger Eco gained popularity in the Early to Mid-2000s along with Frutiger Aero, both aesthetics utilizing bright and glossy futuristic look to inspire feelings of hope for the future. Frutiger Eco in particular embodied this sentiment using imagery associated with both the future and nature to create a futuristic, utopic feeling. This sense of futuristic eco-friendliness was in response to the growing worries of climate change at the time (these worries still persist today) and Frutiger Eco (along with Frutiger Aero and its sub-aesthetics) aimed to quell these worries and encourage optimism. This led to Frutiger Eco being largely adopted by corporations, its imagery being used to push the values of eco-friendliness and sustainability. During this time, a more corporate version of Frutiger Eco appeared known as Renewable Corporate Futurism. Along with Frutiger Aero, in the Mid-2010s Frutiger Eco started to lose traction as an aesthetic and a design style. By 2017, with the popularization of Flat Design, the \"Frutiger\" look had lost most of its mainstream popularity. However, Frutiger Eco still persists and is still quite popular in the realm of cleaning product logo design. Renewable Corporate Futurism (RCF) also known as Stock Eco Office, Stecoffism, or Solargraphic is a subgenre of Frutiger Eco, Frutiger Aero and Corporate. Renewable Corporate Futurism promoted environmental positivity during a time when global warming was (and still is) a great issue. It combines the utopic futurist, humanist, naturist themes of Frutiger Aero and Eco with Corporate office based imagery and values. RCF came to prominence in the Late-2000s and lost popularity in the Late-2010s. Frutiger Eco's visuals are a unique blend of advanced technology and nature, with a strong focus on sustainability and eco-friendliness (similar to Solarpunk and Cyberparadism). The futuristic cities depicted in Frutiger Eco showcase (sometimes, but not always) futuristic technology with a focus on including renewable energy sources (such as solar panels (a prevalent visual in Frutiger Eco) as well as plant life being included as part of the architecture of the buildings. The more corporate graphic design visuals for Frutiger Eco include depictions of the Earth (usually - but not always - green), solar panels, plant life such as trees, and general iconography related to nature and sustainability. Frutiger Aero's influence on Frutiger Eco manifests itself in the form of motifs such as glossy textures, \"humanism\",  bokeh, bubbles, and abstract flourishes.",

How these furry characters are depicted can differ vastly from artist to artist. Nonetheless, in general, most furry artists have a preference for bright, happy colours, often with pastel tones. In many OCs (especially older ones made pre-2010), tacky, kitschy colour combinations are seen (such as a wolf character with grey body, neon blue snout, eyes and hair, plus bright pink stripes on their body). Although this trend seems to have diminished somewhat, the preference for bright, happy colours remains, which is unsurprising, considering how many furry characters are - directly or indirectly - inspired by cartoons. Therefore, the furry fandom is often close to Kidcore. Obviously, not all furry artists have this aesthetic, and in principle virtually any aesthetic may be combined with a furry character. The furry subculture has its roots in the 1970s underground comix movement, a genre of comics of which depicted adult content In 1976, a pair of cartoonists created a press association based on animal based art called Vootie, many of its featured works featured adult themes The concept of a “furry” itself originated at a science fiction convention in 1980, when a discussion started about more anthropomorphic characters in science fiction novels. Anthropomorphic cartoon characters are the core of furry visuals, seen through either artwork or custom suits called \"fursuits\". The colors used in furry designs are neon and very bright. Furries occasionally accessorize with pins, buttons, badges, wallets, lanyards, backpacks, shirts, hoodies, and socks that feature furry characters or are custom-made to resemble a fursona. Tails and animal ear headbands made of faux fur are also sometimes worn. Kigurumi, or kigu, is a type of hooded one-piece pajama costume that originates from Japan. Kigurumi are made to resemble animal bodies and have animal faces on the hood. Kigurumi are somewhat popular with furries as a more accessible way to dress like their fursonas without spending thousands on a fursuit. A fursuit is a costume designed to look like a fursona or another anthropomorphized character. The main component is the fursuit head, with additional components like gloves, shoes, sleeves, and body suits being optional to complete the look. A fursuit is comparable to a mascot costume, but no official affiliation to a brand is made and the head and body of the fursuit is more structured. Sometimes fursuit makers will design and construct a fursuit that is not a commissioned piece and auction or sell it off to a second party. In this case, that suit is called a \"pre-made\". Some fursuits have magnetized eyebrows and eyelids or electronic components like lights and speakers to aid in character performance. A fursuit can be any species, including fictional or anthropomorphized inanimate objects, and the colors chosen are often unnatural for the species. The number of furries that own or desire a fursuit is small compared to the size of the furry fandom. A toony fursuit head has large, exaggerated facial features and resembles a cartoon more than a real animal. Toony suits often have plastic mesh eyes, fabric teeth and tongues, plush noses, and body padding to help make a rounded silhouette. Markings on toony suits are usually made by piecing the fur sewing patterns together. Semi-realistic fursuits blend traits of toony and realistic suits in a variety of ways. This could be a combination of realistic colors and toony proportions, fantasy colors on a realistic suit, realistic eyes and a realistic muzzle with toony ears and hair, or any other combination possible. Realistic fursuit heads have small eyes made from painted glass cabochons. They are made to look as realistic as possible and have less visibility than toony heads as a result. The markings of realistic suits use more airbrushing than toony suits to to achieve a smooth and realistic blending of colors. Kemono is a Japanese fursuit style utilizing highly detailed anime eyes that are created by printing a digital artwork of the iris on either perforated material or as a sticker on top of black car tint. There is a tendency to a chibi-like style, but mature character designs exist as well. Furkig is a type of furry costume that utilizes a solid mask base (often 3D printed), a zentai/morph suit, and elaborate outfits. Different to a fursuit, both the head and body are smooth with fur being only used for minor parts like ears, and tails. They often feature wigs made from synthetic hair instead of hair sculpted from faux fur like fursuits have. They are the most common among kemono fans. Plantigrade fursuits have feet and legs built like a regular human leg. They don't mimic the toe-walking stance of many mammals and are considered easier to make than digitigrade fursuits. For some animals, like bears, plantigrade suits are more realistic than digitigrade suits. Digitigrade (or digi) fursuits have sculpted feet and legs to achieve the illusion of an animal that walks on its toes, such as a cat or a dog. A partial fursuit is a suit that doesn't cover the wearer's entire body. This can be anything from just a head (head only) to everything but the torso (3/4 suit). Common partial components are a head, paw gloves, a tail, and paw shoes. Partials are worn with human clothing covering the non-costumed portions of the wearer's body. A fursuiter wearing a partial without sleeves or legs in combination with a short-sleeved shirt or shorts in a manner that reveals their human skin is said to be \"poodling\". A fullsuit covers the entire body, including the torso, and is often worn without any additional human clothing, but clothes may be worn over the bodysuit as accessories. Fullsuits can have a variety of leg styles and padding, including plush suits which use a large amount of padding to look like a stuffed toy. A quadsuit or quad costume is a fursuit that utilizes the wearer's arms as forelegs, allowing them to walk on all fours in a hunched position. Quadsuits are rare, owing to the limited number of quadsuit makers. Here you can find a list of media featuring the typical anthropomorphic furry characters. Members of the furry subculture may listen to various genres of music, although they are most associated with EDM music such as Scene. Kemono (ケモノ) is the Japanese equivalent to the Western furry and also commonly used to refer to the anime-inspired style. The term translates to “beast” and fans are referred to as \"kemoner\" (ケモナー). Kemoners dress up in fursuits, go to conventions, draw art, and enjoy the same movies as furries, like Zootopia. In many ways, the fandoms are nearly identical, but there are some differences. Please note this section is available for informational documentation and does not take a stance on this subject, nor does it promote the views detailed. Documentation on all aspects of a subject is necessary for understanding the entirety of the subject through multiple perspectives. Viewer discretion is advised. Among furries, and especially among non-furries, the sexual aspect of the fandom (sometimes still designated using the rather outdated term \"yiff\") is controversial. A number of furries will vehemently claim that the fandom has absolutely nothing to do with sex or porn, explicitly distancing themselves from it and condemning all furry porn, which in a whole in unrelated to the fandom, most furries who separate themselves from the fandom, are simply enjoying the artwork, commissions, and other things the community provides, without the fetish. However, most furries are at ease with the sexual aspect and find erotic furry art one of the most pleasant things about the community. This sexual aspect is by far mostly explored through online pornographic art and not, as is commonly believed, enacted in real life. Among some non-furries, there exists the great misconception that most, if not all furries, are zoophiles, ie. people who fantasize about having sex with actual, feral animals (whether these be 'real' or cartoon animals like Pluto). Most social research however suggests that the vast majority of furries are not interested in sex with non-anthropomorphic animals, and that zoophilia is not more common in the furry fandom than in the general population. Associating the fandom with zoophiles, rapists and pedophiles is about as valid as associating homosexuality with sex offenders.  However, getting this to be accepted common knowledge among your layman is, much like the stigma around homosexuality and sex offenders, going to take a long time to fully scrub from the Furry community.

The Future Funk sound tends to draw a lot of inspiration from French House and Synth Funk and makes new, fun, poppy music. The aesthetics from Future Funk have a strong crossover with Animecore, taking lots of inspiration from anime from the 70's, 80's, and 90's (Sailor Moon and Lum from Urusei Yatsura, in particular, are very popular to use in Future Funk, making them unofficial mascots for the genre).  However, in recent years, Future Funk has grown into being a unique aesthetic in its own right, embracing more Kawaii and City Pop elements than before, but still maintaining the same happy-go-lucky nature that made Future Funk popular in the 2010s. Visually, as popularized by the YouTube channel Artzie Music, Future Funk visual aesthetics are usually just a looped GIF of a classic anime set to the track (popular animes to utilize are Sailor Moon and Urusei Yatsura, although other classics will pop up like Dragon Ball, Lupin the 3rd, Mobile Suit Gundam, and Macross) so elements of Animecore and Kawaii to the visual aesthetics of Future Funk are extremely common, but it's also not unusual to find aesthetic cues from Vaporwave, Synthwave, and Lo-Fi either. As stated above, Future Funk takes musical cues from Vaporwave, French House (which gives it some very subtle connections to the poppier entries into the Synthwave genre), Nu-Disco, and Synth Funk to create fun, happy tracks to dance to, taking samples of old funk tracks from the 70's and 80's (bonus points for using Japanese funk music, which is very obscure compared to its American counterparts) and repurposing them in a manner similar to Vaporwave (to the point where Future Funk will often just be lumped in with the genre despite the very clear differences in musical philosophy between Future Funk and Vaporwave.)  Future Funk is also heavily influenced by City Pop, Japanese New Wave, and 80s British Synthpop (particularly the likes of Japan the band), and as Future Funk has grown as a genre, these influences have become more pronounced. GIF videos are made for these songs by YouTube channels like Neon City Nightlife.

The subculture revolves around the humorous and often exaggerated portrayal of muscular men engaging in wrestling battles, and sometimes other sports. Gachimuchi videos usually involve content meant to portray pornography (especially gay videos) in an over-the-top but not explicitly sexual way by incorporating elements of homoeroticism and Camp humor. Many memes and remixes related to the subculture feature exaggerated movements and suggestive poses that jokingly explore masculinity and sexuality. In Japan, these types of videos are known as \"Wrestling Series\" videos, and they quickly gained meme status online internationally, and became associated with the Japanese OtoMAD video genre through the creation of multiple memes and musical remixes featuring the subculture. The Gachimuchi subculture first appeared in the late 1990s, mostly on websites and online forums where adult-oriented information was shared. It was mainly influenced by the Japanese adult video industry, especifically by the \"muscle worship\" genre. In fact, it was closely related to companies like Can-Am Productions or Colt Studios. These films frequently involved muscular men flexing, posing, and participating in various sports.   \nIt gained meme status during the early 2000s with the expansion of video-sharing websites like NicoNicoDouga and YouTube, where the Gachimuchi subculture grew more popular. Various Japanese Internet users started creating parodies and musical remixes of existing Gachimuchi films depicting strong men by adding funny edits, sound effects, and music. The musical remixes frequently use catchphrases associated with the Gachimuchi subculture - for example, a well known remix is Boy♂Next♂Door, which features multiple voice lines and exaggerated sounds from Gachimuchi movies. Additionally, these types of memes and remixes belonged to a wider Japanese video genre known as \"OtoMAD\", which is kind of like the Japanese counterpart of MLG memes. The fashion associated with Gachimuchi could be described as flamboyant or 'over-the-top'. It often parodies traditional wrestling attire, as well as bondage fashion. Participants of the Gachimuchi subculture often dress in costumes that emphasize exaggerated masculinity and sexual elements. The colours typically used include black and sometimes white accents.   Some common fashion elements seen in Gachimuchi include: Disclaimer: many content related to the Gachimuchi subculture is sexually suggestive. It is advised to not watch or consume the content if you are underage or dislike sexual content.",

The aesthetic is mainly video-based, with many videos simply being titled \"Gamblecore\" on social media to emphasize the irony. It is inspired by other meme formats such as \"Hood Irony\", \"Corecore\" and Arabfunny, first emerging in early 2023 on TikTok. Gamblecore videos use absurd, overstimulating and humorous visuals that satirize the chaotic world of gambling. They frequently use motifs like flashing neon signs, stacks of cash bursting out of money bags, explosions of diamonds and loud repetitive voices encouraging you to spend more money, creating a sensory overload that mimics the intoxicating allure of real-life casinos. Because of this, some people on YouTube jokingly described it as \"the Skibidi Toilet for 50-year-olds\". The main point of the Gamblecore aesthetic is to satirize the absurdity of low-effort misleading advertisements related to online gambling websites and clickbait alike. This includes low-quality rendering, poorly Photoshopped images of trophies and cash, cheesy slogans promising instant wealth to the audience, and clickbait headlines that scream \"WIN BIG NOW!\". These elements can be further exaggerated in the videos by using words \"bazillion\" or other made-up numbers derived from it.",

Clothing may have playful or creative patterns; however, people wearing these patterns do not look like children.[2] Gamine skirts can be mini, knee-length, or midi. They should be made of tulle or another flowing fabric. Sailor skirts and bubble mini-skirts also work for this style. Gamine dresses include baby-doll dresses and little black dresses. Dresses might have bows and/or ruffles. Accessories that fit gamine tend to be small and compact.[3] Pixie cuts are extremely common.

It was prevalent during mid 80's to late 90's. Gangsta is from the word gangster. The genre arose around the mid-1980s in the United States at the hands of rappers like Schoolly D and Ice-T, and was popularized in the latter part of the 1980s by groups like N.W.A. Thanks to the media attraction that Ice-T and N.W.A achieved between the late eighties and early nineties in their country, Gangsta Rap went on to become the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop. Some gangsta rappers in the United States have been associated outside the music circuit with real gangsters, affirming the existence of ties to gangs such as the Bloods or the Crips. Sometimes the aesthetic is banned at bars and venues with rules like no white t-shirts or baggy clothing. The offical reasoning is usually that this style is commonly worn by gangs, but this could also lead to discrimination (or intentionally be racist) as many black people are part of the aesthetic without actually being gangsters.

The term \"nerd\" is frequently used interchangeably with and has definitional similarities to \"geek\". However, some have identified connotative differences between the terms.[1][2][3] The word 'Geek' comes from the English word 'geek' or 'geck', meaning a 'freak'; from Middle Low German 'Geck'. Geck is a standard term in modern German and it means 'fool'. The root also survives in the Dutch and Afrikaans adjective gek ('crazy' or 'bizarre'), as well as some German languages, like the Alsatian word Gickeleshut ('jester's hat'; used during carnival). In 18th century Austria, Gecken were freaks on display in some circuses. In 19th century North America, the term 'geek' referred to a performer in a geek show in a circus, traveling carnival or traveling funfair sideshows. The 1976 edition of the American Heritage Dictionary included only the definition regarding geek shows. This variation of the term was used to comic effect in 1970s TV shows, such as Sanford & Son and Starsky and Hutch. In the Bounty Hunter episode of 1976 of Starsky and Hutch, stating that \"a geek is a freak in a circus side show, who is kept in a pit and they throw snakes and chicken heads at, and he runs around crazy and gobbles them up\", and \"in 1932 the geeks formed their own union\". In that episode, Starsky and Huggy Bear say they read this in an unreliable book. In it, there is a man shooting the head off a bumblebee in flight, and Big Foot, alluding to the apocryphal nature of who is a geek. Professional wrestling manager \"Classy\" Freddie Blassie recorded a song in the 1970s called \"Pencil-Necked Geek\". Geek Chic refers to a minor fashion trend that arose in the mid 2000s in which young people adopted \"geeky\" fashions, such as oversized black horn-rimmed glasses, suspenders/braces, and high-water trousers. The glasses—sometimes worn with non-prescription lenses or without lenses—quickly became the defining aspect of the trend, with the media identifying various celebrities as \"trying geek\" or \"going geek\" for wearing such glasses, such as David Beckham and Justin Timberlake. Meanwhile, in the sports world, many NBA players wore \"geek glasses\" during post-game interviews, drawing comparisons to Steve Urkel. The term \"Geek Chic\" was appropriated by some self-identified \"geeks\" to refer to a new, socially acceptable role in a technologically advanced society.",

It is considered a more natural and \"down-to-earth\" look at futurist optimism of the time. It's characterized by urban typography, a use of plants/nature, underground metros/train stations, airports, city skylines, and a heavy use of minimalism/cool color schemes. GXSC's popularity was a movement in futurist aesthetics that spawned from the economic recovery and growing technology industry of the mid-late 1990s. Some had criticisms about the overly-optimistic, \"bubblegum\" styles of Y2K Futurism and McBling. A notable shift in the visual mood of these styles happened during the turn of the millennium, mainly among Gen Xers and older Millennials. GXSC uses a mix of contemporary urban minimalism and lifestyle with Futuristic Y2K elements, along with the heavy use of Lomo effect (an analog cross-processing method creating saturated, high-contrast, \"soft\" looking photos), bleach bypass and blur technics in photography, and natural and muted colors - especially greens, blues, beiges, tans, greys, and black. There are also elements of 1960s and 1970s nostalgia, which were most common with Generation X. Today, the aesthetic is making a comeback as styles like Y2K Futurism and Frutiger Aero returning to the public eye in the 2020s. Artists like George Clanton, CFCF and Doss overlap a lot with GXSC, and push forward with the style to this day. GXSC uses a mix of contemporary urban minimalism and lifestyle with Y2K Futurism elements, along with the heavy use of Lomo effect (an analog cross-processing method creating saturated, high-contrast, \"soft\"-looking photos), bleach bypass, and blur technics in photography, and natural and muted colors - especially greens, blues, beiges, tans, greys, and blacks. There are also elements of 1960s and 1970s nostalgia, which were most common with Generation X. Following trends with the rest of the visual identity of the aesthetic, the fashion of GXSC is inspired by Y2K Futurism's fashion with a much more muted, softer appearance. Some fashion trends include nude lipstick, middle parts or natural textured hair, natural leathers, knee high boots, duster jackets, and other alternative/grunge streetwear styles. Gen X Soft Club, while being mostly a visual aesthetic, is highly associated with music. Many examples of the aesthetic come from album covers and music videos. While Gen X Soft Club is commonly associated with Downtempo and its Trip Hop subgenre, other Electronic and Rock genres can be included in the aesthetic.

A woman named \"Anna Golka\" has been credited for the popularization of this aesthetic on multiple occasions, and in September of 2022 she told Dame Magazine, While many think maximalism may be a way for Gen-Z to compete with Millennials, Anna Golka is a millennial herself, and believes at its core, Maximalism is just a fun, cluttered, messily colorful way to express yourself.[1] Maximalist fashion has more overlap with Decora and Kidcore than its graphic and interior design counterparts, but other than that it's more or less the same, with colorful, cluttered themes. However, Maximalist fashion tends to lean more towards Kidcore when it comes to its choice of a primary color palette. In contrast, Maximalism seems to learn more towards clutter in clashing and contrasting saturated colors throughout the outfit, as opposed to clutter in the sheer volume of accessories often found in Decora. Another stark difference between the two is Decora's primary focus on fashion, and Maximalism's primary focus on graphic and interior design. Note the overlap between the two does mean many decora outfits can also fall under the category of maximalism fashion, and vice versa.

Although the exact origin of the face is unknown, the aesthetic associated with the Gesugao face was developed during the late 2010s, with many Manga Music Videos (MMVs) featuring these types of faces and visuals.   It especially gained meme status in 2018 and 2019, when the YouTuber Ms. Pantsu uploaded an AMV for the song \"U Got That\" by Halogen. The video itself depicted various manga panels from the Kantai Collection series, which featured Ship Girl characters doing Gesugao faces. The aesthetic used in the video quickly became popular due to the cliché nature of the facial expressions, as well as its other intimidating visuals. While the exact origin of Gesugao is not known, it is thought to have been popularized in Nico Nico Douga when an user uploaded a video featuring various variations of the face. The video was published on May 24th, 2013 and featured characters from the Touhou Project series [1]. After 2013, its popularity continued to grow in websites like Danbooru, Tumblr, FunnyJunk and Urban Dictionary. However it wasn't until September 2018 when the aesthetic associated with Gesugao faces became a thing; that day, a group of anonymous 4chan users made a thread about the Gesugao aesthetic. Finally, the 18th of October of 2018, a YouTuber known as \"Ms. Pantsu\" uploaded a MMV video featuring the song \"U Got That\" by Halogen. The video soon enough became a viral meme, and many other users in YouTube, Pinterest and Tumblr followed the trend, making more MMVs and edits. The aesthetic also went through a revival during 2022-2023 when Drift Phonk and Ragecore music went viral on TikTok, as some artists started to incorporate it into their song cover arts and MVs.

It is a broadly encompassing and (sometimes satirical) celebration of the modernist movement (including technology, consumer goods, architecture, fashion and graphic design) as manifested specifically in France during the presidency of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing (1974-1981), though it also extends to the 1960s and to the end of the 1980s despite Giscard not being president during these years. Put simply, GiscardPunk can be seen as a French offshoot of wider nostalgia for this time period with a particular focus on modernism and the contemporary concept of 'progress' in general. That said, GiscardPunk is also intrinsically linked to a satirical alternate-history narrative (also created by Deloison) in which, unlike in our own timeline, Giscard was re-elected as president of France in 1981. This uchronia is not intended to be taken seriously and is both dystopian and irrational by nature. It is therefore a source of humorous content and memes for its fans, though it must be stressed that a large portion of GiscardPunk content is a genuine expression of admiration and nostalgia for the time period rather than for the alternate timeline and that media associated with GiscardPunk does not necessarily have to correspond with lore. Essentially, both admiration for the era and the alternate-history lore run alongside each other as two parts of the GiscardPunk genre and can either be engaged separately or simultaneously by its fans, potentially on an interchangeable basis. It be stressed that, while the genre caries the name of Giscard d'Estaing and therefore could be considered a form of Politicalwave, engagement with the aesthetic does not necessarily imply political allegiance with the ideology of said individual. Rather, Giscard's name is used as an umbrella term covering various elements of modernist society in France during his presidency and indeed the surrounding years, whether or not he was at all associated, directly or indirectly, with any given element of the aesthetic. In fact, some of the typical motifs, including the TGV and Minitel, were not commercially available/accessible to the wider public until after he left office. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing (often referred to simply as \"Giscard\" or \"VGE\") was, at the time of his election, a member of the right-wing Independent Republicans party, though he pushed for a more centrist outlook and felt that change was necessary. After his election in 1974, he instituted numerous reforms in a bid to modernise French society, and some of the accomplishments his presidency is known for include the advancement of rights for women (introducing divorce by consent and the legalization of abortion), young people (lowering the voting age from 21 to 18) and disabled people (laws fostering increased ease of integration into economic and public life). In 1976, he described his vision for an \"advanced liberal society” in which the state promoted economic growth and encouraged major industrial investments of modernisation, including the TGV project and the nuclear industry. He saw appeasing the rising middle class with the development of individual liberties and personal development in addition to the promotion of a quality living environment as necessary to governing from a centrist position. Notable domestic projects that were directly promoted by Giscard include the TGV, the development of nuclear energy and the Minitel computer network. In an international context, he was a strong supporter of European integration and unity who worked with other European Community heads to introduce measures with these goals in mind, particularly in the form of Franco-German cooperation. While admiration and nostalgia for the 1970s and 1980 in general has existed for some time, GiscardPunk as a France-specific aesthetic with its own set of particular connotations, motifs and values can be attributed to artist, developer and art & design teacher Florent Deloison who is the self-declared creator of the aesthetic, specifying the year of its creation as 2013. He also credits himself for coining the term \"GiscardPunk\". The lore imagined by its creator as described on the aesthetic's official website describes an eccentric and dystopian world, labelled by Deloison himself as an \"absurd continuation\" of the modernity embodied by the France of the 1960s-1980s. It features extreme events and occurrences that venture into the realms of science fiction and surrealism. The timeline deviates in 1979 and ends in 2012 with the eradication of humanity by Hamsters. At the start of the timeline, agents from the French foreign intelligence agency effectively conceal the Bokassa diamonds affair that tarnished Giscard's reputation. As a result, Giscard is re-elected in 1981 with a majority of 99.7% and the 5th Republic is dissolved. Over the course of the alternate timeline, France is described as becoming a military, industrial and nuclear powerhouse. Some events of note include: GiscardPunk revolves heavily around the technology, architecture and aesthetics of France in the 1960s to the 1980s. As such, common themes include: A core recurring element of the GiscardPunk movement and perhaps that which msot ties it to the Cassette Futurism and cyberPunk aesthetics is the Minitel (initially officially known as TELETEL). This was French videotex service developed towards the end of the 1970s by former French postal company Postes, Télégraphes et Téléphones prior to the introduction of the World Wide Web. It was rolled out commercially in the early 1980s after testing and allowed users to access information, use services such as online banking, shop and communicate using computer terminals. Users accessed services/pages using codes such as 3615 SNCF (the national rail service) and 3615 LEMONDE (for the Le Monde newspaper). The Minitel system was France's own contribution to the rise of personal computing and is seen by some as ahead of its time. The service was not retired until June 2012, though in 2009 the network still had 10 million monthly connections. The TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse) is high-speed train service developed in the 1970s and launched as a commercial mode in transport from 1981. Successor designs of the TGV are still in use today and the technology is widely acclaimed as an extremely successful French invention. Originally powered with an experimental gas turbine, the TGV, with its striking shape and bright orange livery, came to be known as a symbol of French progress towards the future. GiscardPunk pays particular attention to cars produced by French companies such as Renault, Peugeot and Citroën from the 1960s-1980s, with an emphasis on vehicles produced for the mass market such as the Renault 5, in addition to futuristic concept cars such as the Citroën Karin. Non-traditional and (for the time) futuristic forms of architecture are a core part of GiscardPunk aesthetic. This element is often the subject of memes within the genre that humorously showing new building styles being ruthlessly implemented on a mass scale with disregard for the traditional architecture and landmarks of France.

It was performed by musicians who wore outrageous costumes, makeup, and hairstyles, particularly platform shoes and glitter. Glam artists drew on diverse sources across music and throwaway pop culture, ranging from bubblegum pop and 1950s rock and roll to cabaret, science fiction, and complex art rock. The flamboyant clothing and visual styles of performers were often camp or androgynous, and have been described as playing with other gender roles. Glitter rock was a more extreme version of glam. The UK charts were inundated with glam rock acts from 1971 to 1975. The March 1971 appearance of T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan on the BBC music show Top of the Pops, wearing glitter and satin, is often cited as the beginning of the movement. Other British glam rock artists include David Bowie, Mott the Hoople, Sweet, Slade, Mud, Roxy Music and Gary Glitter. Those not central to the genre, such as Elton John, Rod Stewart and Queen, also adopted glam styles. There was a similar scene in the United States, with Alice Cooper, Kiss, The Tubes, Brownsville Station, and Lou Reed being the most popular American exponents of the style. Other American glam artists include the New York Dolls, Sparks, Suzi Quatro, Iggy Pop, Zolar X, The Runaways, Cherry Vanilla, The Magic Tramps, Ruby and the Rednecks, and Jobriath - many of these acts constituted the \"glam punk\" style, a movement that was most prominent in New York City, Los Angeles, and the Northeastern United States. Glam rock declined after the mid-1970s, but influenced other musical genres including punk rock, glam metal, New Romantic, deathrock and gothic rock.[1] In the late 70s, bands like Hanoi Rocks and Japan the Band (before they went to New Romantic and City Pop) embraced a punk-tinged version of this aesthetic and musical sound. They went on to influence a few Goth bands (Gene Loves Jezebel especially), some Japanese Goth and Visual Kei, and nigh the entirety of the Hair Metal scene.

It combines depth, motion, and material to create a seamless user experience, while preserving the clean look and feel Flat Design introduced; it shares similarities with both Flat Design and Frutiger Aero. It has been used in UI design since the Mid-2010s, and some notable examples include Microsoft Fluent Design, which was first introduced in 2017 and is now being used in Windows 11, Bing, and Microsoft Edge UI. Android custom UI/UX, mostly Chinese brands, such as EMUI, ColorOS, and MIUI have also been using this since around 2015-2016. Recently, some Linux distros have also been implementing this design; iOS/macOS have been the first using it since 2013.  Glassmorphism/Fluent Design is not a subgenre of Skeuomorphism because they don't have much in common, and breaks the realistic motifs of Skeuomorphism. However, it can be considered an adjacent/heavily related aesthetic. Neumorphism is a subgenre of Glassmorphism. The roots of Glassmorphism can be traced back to Apple's iOS 7 released in 2013. Apple played a significant role in its inception, introducing translucent backgrounds, subtle transparency effects, rounded corners, and gradients that paved the way for what we now recognize as Glassmorphism. Since its introduction, this design has undergone various transformations and gained broader recognition. or example, since 2016, Xiaomi, Huawei, Oppo and other brands custom UI's tried to imitate the UI/UX design of iOS. Microsoft's Fluent Design System design language released in 2017 showcases aspects of Glassmorphism, with its emphasis on transparency, soft lighting, and subtle depth effects. Windows 11 (2021) currently features Glassmorphism in the form of Fluent Design. Glassmorphism incorporates elements from other aesthetics such as Frutiger Aero's \"aero\" glass, and shiny translucent effects. It also borrows from the simplicity of Flat Design, while incorporating elements that make use of gentle forms and soft edges, sometimes combined with muted lights and subtle shadows. In contrast to the muted and minimalistic tendencies of Flat Design, Glassmorphism adopts a diverse range of colors, a more humanistic terface, and frosted/translucent transparency effects. Wallpaper designs within the Glassmorphic realm tend to be simple, abstract, and colorful, as seen in Xiaomi, Huawei, Samsung and the latest builds of iOS and macOS. Neumorphism, also referred to as Claymorphism, is a design language and Glassmorphism/Skeuomorphism sub-aesthetic that combines elements of Skeuomorphism and Flat Design. It emphasizes soft, rounded shapes, subtle shadows, and gradients. It is often used in UI/UX designs to create a more realistic, natural look and feel. Neumorphism was created in 2019 by independent Figma community designers. Windows 11 and macOS only apply Neumorphism to certain icons but not to their entire UIs.",

The aim is to appreciate the quiet through dim surroundings. Those who take a liking to this genre tend to find beauty in cloudy skies, foggy coastlines and tall, endless green forests. Gloomcore folks love all things odd and otherworldly. It's like nature, but with a darker tone. Forests with mosses and lichens, lots of plants, tall trees, and fog covering up the tops of the trees are the noticeable things you can find in forests that aren't bustling with energy or have any crowded spaces. Another good example is a hazy beach with no sun anywhere to be seen, just light brown sand and water with slow, grey waves stretching for miles. Most places revolve around forests and beaches, though there also might be rivers, streams, lakes, and other bodies of water, including puddles. Moors, mountains and other landforms where you can overlook a beautiful view are also appreciated natural aspects of Gloomcore. People who associate themselves with this aesthetic tend to focus on irregular and wondrous things or ideas, like the angle of light on water, cryptid sightings and long forest walks. The weather is supposed to have mellow, dreamy and slightly ethereal undertones that possibly lead to long thought processes and the bubbling of one's imagination. Though something like the rain, cold seasons, fall, winter, thunderstorms and lightning storms are prevalent, quiet foggy days mist, and even dry skies filled with petrichor count as well. The clothes must be related to the dull, mysterious atmosphere and cold weather. Since most of the forests and environments that fit into Gloomcore are usually cool and damp, warm clothing is common. Some of the items are: Although the most prominent activity in Gloomcore is enjoying spending one's time looking at the aspects of nature, there are other things, such as: Because of the nature this aesthetic is based on, Gloomcore music is soft, based on the ideas of being in nature and other Gloomcore hobbies. Of course, the perfect music would be something mysterious and soft, perfect to meditate or \"gloom\" to. Background ambience from nature such as rain is often added to the music.

It is closely associated with raving or just good old-fashioned partying (similar to Cuddle Party), though it can have ties to the old Hippie culture. Glowwave aesthetics focus on things like glow sticks, lasers, and anything that either glows in the dark or is able to glow under a blacklight.

Glowwave hair and make-up can also be glow in the dark or blacklight-reactive as well.  Light-Up/Glow in the Dark things such as Backpacks, shoes, nail polish, t-shirts, pants, jewelry, etc. are often utilized as part of the Glowwave aesthetic.

These aspects can range from animals such as frogs and snails to materials such as moss, mud, plants, and fungi such as mushrooms. A part of this beloved \"ugliness\" is the Goblin itself, a malevolent thieving creature in European folklore, but in Goblincore a carefree representation of one's infatuation with nature's \"ugliness\" and general unpredictability. Goblincore is essentially a dark, or unseelie, version of Fairycore (in Celtic myth, fae are seperated by the beautiful and generally more benevolent seelie court and the uglier, more malevolent unseelie court). Goblincore is popular in the LGBTQ+ community, especially among non-binary, transgender & demigender people. A significant part of Goblincore is the desire to collect and hoard small, often shiny objects, affectionately termed \"shinies\" by practicing Goblins. Many Goblins are closely involved in adjacent movements such as Cottagecore, and Vulture Culture. Goblincore fashion can involve any clothing that is suitable for adventure, but most goblincore fans like outfits with several clashing patterns/colors. Lots of the clothing is worn-out, thrifted, or second-hand for a more comfortable feel. Most goblincore fans enjoy getting dirty, so keeping their clothes fresh and clean isn't a top priority. Cozy Oversized Sweaters, worn-out or customized jeans and overalls, and unique socks are staples in goblincore fashion. These people like to wander around the woods and collect random objects that pique their interest. Since they love nature so much, Earthy colored clothes like brown or green fit them the best. Goblins are often seen in dark green or brown clothes. Sometimes, they will also have belts with alchemists pouches or a satchel to store shiny objects. Mainly nature kind, like woody, green and floral: Bamboo, Galbanum, Pine, Chypre, Herbal, Spring, Sandalwood... Goblincore has been accused of and criticized for being antisemitic.[1] This is because Goblins, especially when depicted as ugly, thieving or greedy creatures obsessed with shiny things, have sometimes been used as an anti-semitic caricature. People have suggested alternatives to the name, calling it Gremlincore instead of Goblincore,[2] or simply changing it to Crowcore, Dragoncore, or other aesthetics similar to Goblincore. There are Jewish people who disapprove of Goblincore,[3] but also those who do not.[4] One explanation of why Goblincore is not essentially antisemitic: However, as another user on the same thread pointed out, unconscious stereotyping and bigotry is very much a part of human nature, and not everyone may be able to distinguish between ancient folkloric traditions and more recent anti-Jewish propaganda.[5] Some tropes that carry heavy antisemitic baggage are goblins as greedy and power hungry, ugly goblins--especially featuring warty, hooked noses and/or green skin--and goblins as both depraved and contagious. \nOne Jewish blogger's advice for avoiding antisemitism in Goblincore: Goblincore has also been accused of excessively cross-tagging in the Witchblr community, something taken very seriously on the website Tumblr.

The plots revolve around upper class characters and murder. It centers around the dichotomy between the elegance of the European elite and the savagery and blood that comes with the events of the story. Feelings of suspense, interesting characters with different backgrounds, and glamorous settings are major components of this aesthetic. The characters in these mystery stories are often members of the British landed gentry, or else their servants. Although England is the most common setting, these mysteries can take place in any part of the British Empire, such as India or Australia. Although the time period is usually between the 1920s and 1930s, the popularity of the genre led to it being adapted to suit more modern times. Activities such as hunting, cocktail parties, and travel via ship and steam train remained largely unchanged for several decades that followed. Exotic elements, such as the story taking place in jungles or deserts, tropical animals, and non-European artifacts can also be incorporated due to the British Empire's influence. Many stories revolve around characters who are colonial authorities, explorers, archaeologists, and travelers. Please note that because of the time period, the depictions of the native people are often ignored or racist due to the prejudice of the time period. The visual and story tropes arose from the popularity of authors such as Agatha Christie.  Many mystery writers that followed were inspired by the works of these earlier writers, and certain elements of the plot, the settings, and character types are repeated by mystery writers to this day. Parodies of this aesthetic can also be found in more recent works, such as the game Clue, and the Doctor Who episode, \"The Unicorn and the Wasp.\" Elements of works from the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, such as the female amateur detective and tightly knit community of characters influenced the Cozy Mystery genre. These mysteries are sometimes seen as formulaic and over-done but are popular among those who prefer \"clean\" mysteries where violence is of screen, there is very little profanity, and sex is usually not even discussed. The Cozy Mystery genre is not limited to the time period of the 1920s-1930s, although some mysteries are set during that time period. A lot of the imagery is connected with Gothic literature and horror, but the main story and visual component is free of supernatural components in favor of showing the motives of the criminals that started the events of the plot. The nobility being the perpetrator can also serve as a critique of their over-indulgence and greed. It also shares visual tropes and some story components with Dark Academia, but does not involve learning and explicitly takes place among non-students. Some of the tropes, such as troubled detectives and the Femme Fatale evolved to re-appear in noir aesthetics. Please do not include film adaptations of other works This does not include works done by the authors previously mentioned",

It also frequently features lens flare, palm trees, and flowers. Golden Hour visuals are often of sunrises and sunsets taken at just that perfect time (California, Hawaiian, and any sort of Tropical Island horizons are particularly popular within Golden Hour visuals, since they offer the best clarity and color palette for these sorts of images).  Golden Hour aesthetics can also be paired quite successfully with VSCO.  It is named Golden Hour due to the fact all pictures taken around this time are given a very warm, golden hue to them. Silhouettes and shadows are also common to see within this aesthetic, along with pictures of eyes catching the golden light. A lot of Golden Hour-themed music is designed to invoke a summertime vibe, so there's a lot of crossover with Vaporwave (specifically Future Funk), Lo-Fi, EDM, and certain flavors of Synthwave music, as well as summertime pop hits of any time, designed to give the timeless feel of the freedom of summer. While Golden Hour is the best-documented, there appear to be other aesthetics in a similar vein popping up on social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok.  These include: Black Hour is a rather flexible aesthetic that largely takes on the sights and sounds of the night time, which can lead to two different interpretations of Black Hour: a darker, scarier, or gloomier atmosphere designed to put the viewer at unease or something more akin to After Hours, where it conveys a sense of peace, tranquility, and fun.  Black Hour can also be a heavy element to Halloween-centric aesthetics. Grey Hour, unlike Black Hour, seems to not be nearly as flexible in its usage, but is used to convey a gloomy, melancholy, sad atmosphere that could be something similar to Dullcore.  Grey Hour is heavily characterized by its overcast skies in the day and has also shown to incorporate elements such as rain or snow to carry its melancholic motif. Pink Hour and Purple Hour convey similar vibes with a slightly romantic, idyllic motif, with the main difference between the two (besides the predominant color) being that Pink Hour has a distinctly more feminine vibe than Purple Hour, but both convey an atmosphere similar to what you would find in Lo-Fi; nostalgic, warm, comforting, and tranquil.  This is typically that time of day between Golden Hour and Black Hour when skies aren't overcast.  Also, Pink Hour utilizes pastel colors in its color palette while Purple Hour utilizes brighter, more vivid colors. Red Hour conveys a vibe similar to what one could find in Liminal Space, where there is a slight element of danger to the subject.  The element of danger can range to Liminal Space's sense of anxiety and horror to out-right Post-Apocalyptic war. Green Hour, similar to Black Hour, can be flexible in its usage, ranging from a more horrific and terrifying atmosphere (think something similar to the Saw movies) to something more akin to stepping out of the haze of Blue Hour, delving some into After Hours/Lo-Fi vibes (especially when it's used in a more Urban setting).  Green Hour is also the most likely to implement nature into its subject. Blue Hour conveys a similar vibe to Dazecore, where everything feels hazy and disorienting. While White Hour can share some similar colors to Grey Hour or Blue Hour, White Hour has an almost supernaturally pure and angelic atmosphere to it.

Consequently the form is loose and unrestrictive, the material choice is utilitarian, and individual items are layered to amplify the impression of comfort and informality. Gorpcore is considered to be closely related to normcore. The imagery is evocative of the characteristic style of the 1990's Wakayama hiking community, images of which have been frequently circulated in street fashion circles before the term's inception. The term 'Gorp' was initially coined by 4Chan users in 2017 and was originally intended to be an acronym for 'Graduate Orthodontics Residents Program'. The term is now more commonly stated to be an acronym for 'Good old raisins and peanuts', a reference to the food item trail mix that is popular with hikers and those who engage in outdoors exercise. GORP also widely refers to \"Gary Oldman Rise (of the) Planet (of the Apes)\", in relation to the actor's award winning performance in the 2011 film.

It combines early 50s rock n' roll music influences with punk undertones. Music influences in Gothabilly are really vast, stemming from early rock and roll influences such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard, classic goth artist like Bauhaus and The Cure, and Psychobilly icons like The Cramps, The Nekromantix, HorrorPops and Tiger Army. The term Gothabilly is a portmanteau word that combines gothic subculture with 1950s rockabilly. First used in the late 70s by The Cramps to describe their somber blend of rockabilly and punk rock. Thus, Goth and Rockabilly came together, in music and fashion, creating the Gothabilly. The style has also been linked to Deathrock, since there’s heavy amounts of love for vintage horror and dark humor. Goth rock is blended with the blues and country, a less aggressive form of one of its inspirations, Psychobilly. There’s an old retro rock n’ roll feel in Gothabilly, along with its dark and morbid tendencies that draw many people to the subculture. Gothabilly fashion combines elements of gothic and rockabilly styles. A typical Gothabilly outfit includes a vintage-inspired rockabilly dress with gothic accessories like fishnet stockings, chokers, cardigans and platform shoes. This combination creates a perfect blend of edgy and retro vibes. Contrasting colors such as black and red, purple and pink, and blue and green can help make a statement with a Gothabilly outfit. For example, you can pair a black leather jacket with a bright red or electric blue rockabilly dress. This contrast adds visual interest and highlights the fusion of different styles. Rockabilly fashion often features retro prints like polka dots, animal print, cherries, swallows, or skulls. You can incorporate these prints into your Gothabilly outfit by choosing a dress or top with a retro-inspired pattern. Pair it with gothic accessories and dark makeup to complete the look. Accessorizing is key to achieving the Gothabilly aesthetic. Look for vintage-inspired jewelry pieces like cameo brooches, skull earrings, or spiderweb necklaces. These accessories add a touch of gothic elegance to your outfit. Hairstyle can greatly enhance your Gothabilly look. Victory rolls, pin-up curls, or a sleek black bob with bangs are a great staple that complement the retro and edgy elements of the Gothabilly aesthetic. Some components of the style may include some Fetish Goth elements with its use of black silks, satins, lace and velvet, corsets, top hats, antique jewelry, PVC, and leather. Gothabilly music has a distinct sound that’s different from Psychobilly, while Psychobilly fuses 1950s rockabilly with 1970s punk rock in a faster, more aggressive sound, vintage monster movies and grease-stained '60s garage rock, Gothabilly fuses the bluesy side of rockabilly with gothic piano and guitar, and is defined by having slower tempos and emphasizing mood over aggression.

Gothcore is a fusion of gothic rock, gothic metal and hardcore punk (or metalcore). Bands may have typical metalcore vocals, metalcore guitar structure with breakdowns, drumming implementing tribal and blast beats, mixed with gothic rock/post-punk inspired clean vocals, and gothic rock style synth lines. Fashion is a very central part of Gothcore. Gothcore fashion takes the goth fashion and combines it with the metalcore looks. Black skinny jeans and black t-shirt at the simplest of clothing choices. Optionally pale makeup and blacked out eyes or eyeliner are worn. For a female look, Misa Amane and for males Ryuk the shinigami from Death Note are figures inspiration for a gothcore look. Goth, but make it \"modern\". A few examples are: The blend of influences from goth bands such as Bauhaus, Siouxsie & The Banshees, and Christian Death with the hardcore punk bands like Black Flag, The Germs, Extreme Noise Terror, as well as metalcore bands like Bleeding Through and It Dies Today. The sounds of the music is a crossover of dark post punk, dark post hardcore and dark metal. Some bands incorporate darkwave and industrial influences as well. Key structures of the songs incorporate breakdowns to the structure of the Gothic Metal influenced sounds. The simple concept is Goth(ic)-(Metal)-Core. Bands that influenced or have the sounds of gothcore: In popular media, gothcore was said to be a new trend in 2022, inspired by many celebrities, such as Kim Kardashian, Olivia Rodrigo, and Megan Fox.[1][2] The style's rapid resurgent was criticized by The Blogging Goth, stating that gothcore is nothing brand new. It was what the author refer to as \"Dark Wash Recycle\" — where the catwalk commandeers goth style for their Fall-Winter collections, and every journalist has to act like they’ve never seen huge boots or winged eyeliner before.[3] The said media also failed to mention thoroughly about the Goth subculture, especially the infamous style of Siouxsie Sioux.[4] In the author interview with Catherine Spooner, Professor of Literature and Culture at Lancaster University, an expert in Goth style, quoting: The original term \"Gothcore\" was coined in 2003 by Christopher Robert Cole aka \"Batlord Carcas\" whom was lead vocals of a Deathrock/Goth/Horror Punk band called One Last Caress as a means to describe the concept of Gothic Metalcore or as well the cross point of Goth and Hardcore Punk. The namesake received criticism amongst some of the Deathrock and Goth peers online upon the internet, both on Wikipedia and Deathrock.Org discussion boards. Oddly enough there was actually bands attempting to form the music style, and as well there had always been attempts to reflect the fashion.",

It is a comfortable, whimsical (but not necessarily chaotic) aesthetic centered around focusing on things we enjoy most.

Most of the things that are involved with grandparentcore are old, vintage, or even antique as it is implied that they have been used or were invented a long time ago. This aesthetic is split into two different aesthetics: Grandmacore and Grandpacore.

This aesthetic parodies the stereotype of a \"Facebook Mom\" or old women who send kitschy celebration GIFs to their families online, as well as old GIF graphics, particularly from GIF editors like PicMix or Blingee. As such, Grażynacore edits typically involve positive phrases, like \"Have a good day\" or \"Good morning\". The visuals of the aesthetic are full of \"flowers, life and wisdom\", as they incorporate a lot of tacky and positive ClipArts from the 1980s and 1990s.  \nThe exact origin of the name \"Grażynacore\" is unknown, however it is suspected to be a reference to the Polish feminine given name \"Grażyna\", which is associated with older women in Poland and means \"pretty\" or \"beautiful\" in the Lithuanian language.  \nThis aesthetic shares many similiarities with Karencore, which parodies English \"Minion Mom\" memes and wholesome memes. The first pictures reminiscent of Grażynacore are thought to have been created sometime around the 1960s, which could be found on sound postcards, which were popular in Poland and other socialist countries at the time. In the 1990s, some cover arts and casette tapes of Disco Polo songs started incorporating elements similiar to what today is the Grażynacore aesthetic. After the popularization of the Internet, this style lived on because many family souvenirs including those types of visuals were uploaded into the Internet as images, and those eventually started being used by social media users, especially on platforms like Facebook. The term \"Grażynacore\" being used to describe this type of images itself appears to have originated in the mid or late 2010s, as seen in various online posts and blogs. \nEver since this specific visual design style was given a name, these visuals have also been incorporated into parodies of the style itself.

Rock-and-roll music was a major part of the culture, and styles were influenced by singers, like Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, Johnny Burnette, Vince Taylor and Ritchie Valens, but the two main figures of the look were Marlon Brando and James Dean. In the 1950s and 1960s, these youths were also known as \"hoods\". This may be due to the fact that the style was more popular in poor neighborhoods that had higher crime rates than upper-class neighborhoods. The name \"greaser\" came from their greased-back hairstyle, which involved combing back hair using hair wax, hair gel, creams, tonics or pomade. The term \"greaser\" reappeared in later decades as part of a revival of 1950s popular culture. One of the first manifestations of this revival was a 1971  American 7 Up television commercial that featured a 1950s greaser saying \"Hey remember me? I'm the teen angel.\" The music act Sha Na Na also played a major role in the revival. Although the greaser subculture was largely a North American youth phenomenon, there were similar subcultures that sprouted up in the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Japan, France, Sweden, Germany, New Zealand and South Africa, due to the influence of American culture and media. In Sweden, they are called \"raggare\". The 1960s British Rockers, also known as a \"ton-up boy\", took inspiration from the Greaser image. Unlike British rockers, who were exclusively bikers, North American greasers were known more for their love of hot rod cars, kustoms and vans, not necessarily motorcycles. Both subcultures are known for being fans of 1950s Doo Wop, Rock and roll, and rockabillymusic. During the 1950s, women also became a part of greaser culture. Like men, they joined motorcycle gangs and wore jackets displaying their group's or gang's name. Latina women involved in gangs typically did not fight side-by-side with male gangs, but they did fight rival female gangs in the 1950s. Women were often depicted as the property of male motorcycle gang members. Clothing usually worn by greasers included: Common accessories included: Common footwear included: In England, the greasers are called \"Teddy Boys\" and they wear drape jackets, creepers and ducktail hairstyles. Typical hairstyles included the pompadour, the Duck's ass, S-Curls, Finger Waves, Afros with parts or shaped like pompadours, and the more combed-back \"Folsom\" style. These hairstyles were held in place with pomade like suavecito and layrite, wax, or hair creams such as brylcreem. The leather jacket, as popularized by pilots during World War II, became an icon of greaser culture. Compared with the previous decades, the 1950s were considered dull and the youths craved a new sense of adventure. The leather jacket marked greaser youths as daring and adventuresome young men, like the pilot heroes of the recent war. The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton\nGrease by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey",

Grifes as an aesthetic is more focused on the material aesthetic of luxury rather then the lifestyle aesthetic of it. The aesthetic of Grifes was founded in 1837 via Paris (France), the same year the first designer brand Hermès was founded. Thierry Hermès originally produced saddles and other equestrian supplies. The first unofficial Hermès bag, which was purely designed as an addition to their riding supplies, was advertised for carrying saddles. Many bags followed, with the exclusive Kelly and Birkin bags being their most successful and iconic products. Louis Vuitton ranks second of the world’s oldest luxury brands, which the aesthetic is most associated with. The French fashion house was founded in 1854 by Louis Vuitton himself. The French designer started his business with trunks made from canvas bearing the brand’s iconic monogram print. Later in 1892 via New York City Vogue, the fashion magazine, was founded starting off as an news-paper. The French luxury brand Chanel was founded by Gabrielle Coco Chanel in 1909. She started her business with hat making, but soon branched out into making comfortable clothing for women, a real revolution at the time. Mario Prada founded the house of Prada in 1913 and started his business by only selling leather goods. He originally sold English leather goods, before the brand started to produce its own leather items made from the iconic Saffiano material. The French luxury goods company Dior was founded in 1946 by Christian Dior. With his first collection, the iconic French designer introduced the world to the New Look: a very feminine line, with a narrow waist and knee-length skirts. Grifes visuals typically include minimalistic backgrounds with expensive beauty products in the foreground. Lavish clothing, perfume, jewelry, handbags, and similar accessories are common motifs of this aesthetic - making Grifes a fashion-oriented aesthetic.

The aesthetic focuses on transforming pre-existing pictures (particularly portraits and selfies, among other imagery) into cartoonish, disfigured and \"zombified\" versions of the original photo, using elements such as dripping faces, exaggerated facial features and non-natural skin colors. This aesthetic particularly became popular during 2015-2018, being mostly associated with Rap, Hip-Hop and Horrorcore Rap music.  \nThe general appeal of Grime Art lies in its ability to be in some way \"relatable\" due to its imperfect grotesque style. By distorting, deforming and drawing over familiar images, Grime artists aim to create a sense of unease and provoke thoughts on the viewers. Grime Art shares many similiarities with Caricaturism, which can date back to as early as the Medieval period, as many artists have been experimenting with distorsion since those times. Grotesque art in particular has been a creative interest of a minority of people since the Classical era, but modern variants have gained important attention in the Internet and social media. The appeal of Grotesque art in general mainly comes from how the grotesque is a common experience, yrt an overlooked and stigmatized one, so somehow it can be relatable to many people. Given all of this, the original idea of Grime Art is that art doesn't necessarily need to be ideal, perfect or \"palatable\". The creation of Grime Art is attributed to Richie Velasquez, more known as deladeso online[1]. Despite this, this aesthetic started to spread after the music video for the Dubstep song \"Head Splitter\" by Getter became an hit in 2015, back when the Dubstep genre was at its peak[2]. The musical video featured Grime Art visuals as well as some Vaporwave elements. Eventually, Grime Art was picked up as a new trend by many artists in social media sites, like Instagram, Tumblr or PicsArt, where an entire challenge based around Grime Art was hosted in 2018[3]. A community of Grime artists started appearing in those platforms, and it progressivily became less repetitive. Despite the fact it was initially associated with Dubstep, it also moved on into other musical genres, including Rap, Hip-Hop and Horrorcore. The visuals of Grime Art are quite simple. Although they originally were used on musical videos, nowadays they're more used in portrait edits and other paintings. Grime Art is usually made by drawing over pre-existing images and adding Grotesque elements, like drip, slime, pepperoni pizza, zombies, melting flesh, vomit and white glowing eyes. It also often includes other elements deemed \"imperfect\" regarding personal appareance, like droopy skin and exaggerated eyebags. As part of its zombie-oriented style, the edits also often include skin colours that are not natural, like pink, light red, blue, green, purple or yellow, and the tones are usually either pastel or bright. Some consider this style to be repetitive, but some dedicated Grime artists like Richie Velasquez have tried to make less repetitive artworks by incorporating and experimenting with new elements.",

In art, performance, and literature, however, grotesque may also refer to something that simultaneously invokes in an audience a feeling of uncomfortable bizarreness as well as sympathetic pity. The English word first appears in the 1560s as a noun borrowed from French, and comes originally from the Italian grottesca (literally \"of a cave\" from the Italian grotta, 'cave'; see grotto), an extravagant style of ancient Roman decorative art rediscovered at Rome at the end of the fifteenth century and subsequently imitated. The word was first used of paintings found on the walls of basements of ruins in Rome that were called at that time le Grotte ('the caves'). These 'caves' were in fact rooms and corridors of the Domus Aurea, the unfinished palace complex started by Nero after the Great Fire of Rome in CE 64, which had become overgrown and buried, until they were broken into again, mostly from above. Spreading from Italian to the other European languages, the term was long used largely interchangeably with arabesque and moresque for types of decorative patterns using curving foliage elements. Rémi Astruc has argued that although there is an immense variety of motifs and figures, the three main tropes of the grotesque are doubleness, hybridity and metamorphosis. Beyond the current understanding of the grotesque as an aesthetic category, he demonstrated how the grotesque functions as a fundamental existential experience. Moreover, Astruc identifies the grotesque as a crucial, and potentially universal, anthropological device that societies have used to conceptualize alterity and change.",

Though not strictly warm and vibrant, Groundcore is generally associated with themes of summer, bright colors, exploration, creativity, being observant and curious, thinking outside the box, as well as the study of and general love for insects, plants and nature as a whole.While often overlapping with aesthetics such as Naturecore or Adventurecore, Groundcore illustrates an overall more crafty, lighthearted and fantastical, in some cases childlike side to the beloved nature aesthetic genre, while still including similar themes. Bugs and Insects, while not necessarily being the main focus of Groundcore (see: Bugcore), do play a big role in real-world depictions of the aesthetic by bringing it to life and allowing it to somewhat branch out in other directions and expand upon itself in many different ways, such as in movies or media, exploring the concept of a bug's adventures or day-to-day life. Note that while Groundcore is, as said above, often depicted to heavily lean towards a warm/summery nature feel, other themes and elements are not to be entirely excluded from the aesthetic, at times even presenting an additional subsection of it altogether, (i.e., a currently undefined but perfectly valid concept of 'winter-themed Groundcore' with its own set of visuals).Due to this, Groundcore may be better thought of as a somewhat broad umbrella term, which is mostly up to the viewer's interpretation, rather than a strictly defined aesthetic. Keep in mind that, while garbage/litter is considered to be one of Groundcore's main components, the aesthetic is in no way meant to encourage or promote littering, but instead aims to introduce creative ways of recycling preexisting trash. Groundcore visuals may vary depending on the setting, exact time of day/year and/or place, but the most generally recognized ones include: Themes (not to be confused with visuals), in this case, is a general term that is used to provide both real-life and fantasy examples of Groundcore's main characteristics and the use of this aesthetic in media. Groundcore's fashion mainly centers around combining a fun, casual, childlike style with maximum functionality and comfortability, as to provide the best experience while out adventuring or digging around in the backyard. Examples of this include but are not limited to: Since Groundcore is not considered to have a separate music style or genre and is extremely hard to accurately pin down due to its novelty and subjective nature, it mainly relies on the overall feel of songs (typically carefree, cheerful, somewhat magical and/or childlike), as well as matching lyrical themes in its representation.

Historically, the original grunge movement has its roots in the 1990s hard rock scene of Seattle, Washington. It was a countercultural, anti-consumerism youth movement and musical genre that defined Generation X. Grunge fashion was made popular by bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden, and was meant to be timeless and quite casual. Grunge started in 1985 with Green River's album Come on Down, but it did not become mainstream until the 1990s with Nirvana's Nevermind. Grunge was most popular from roughly 1991 to 1997 and eventually lost its anti-consumerist philosophy. It can be argued that grunge began to decline in 1994, after the tragic suicide of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, though the genre maintained popularity until about 1997 when Soundgarden broke up. After the original grunge went out of fashion, it started to trail off into post-grunge, a type of commercialized radio rock that contained grunge influences, and overlapped with the Minivan Rock style. This included bands like Creed, Nickelback, Staind, Matchbox 20, Fuel, Puddle of Mudd, and the Foo Fighters (fronted by former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl). Due to its perceived low quality, post-grunge has sometimes been nicknamed \"butt rock\", an alleged play on the radio slogan \"Nothing but rock\". Grunge started coming back into fashion in the 2010s and 2020s as '90s nostalgia began (an argument could be made that this led to the rise in prominence of Vaporwave as well). Grunge songs were featured on games like Rock Band and Guitar Hero which introduced them to a new generation of fans. This revival saw old staples of the original grunge scene making a return to popularity, such as Soundgarden with King Animal and Alice in Chains with Black Gives Way to Blue, and also led to some new grunge bands rising up the ranks, such as The Jins, Sun Puddle, and Wolf Alice. In addition to the music, grunge fashion also made a comeback, i.e. Pastel Grunge and Soft Grunge. The philosophical elements of the original Grunge movement were largely dropped in this revival, where people merely achieved the visual aesthetic of looking Grunge, often paying far more exorbitant amounts of money compared to the original Grunge style icons, who almost exclusively shopped at Thrift Stores. A majority of Grunge's visuals involve a large amount of dirty, grimy imagery. These show a sort of hopelessness and disenchantment with modern society. A lot of earth tones and pale colors are used to convey this sort of cultural depression often associated with Grunge. Grunge fashion of the late 1980s and early-mid 1990s was often purchased out of thrift stores at the time. Some will argue it was done out of a rejection of the fashions of the time. It's generally agreed that it's because it was cheaper as, at the time, most grunge artists were dirt poor. As the fashion became more mainstream, editor of men's magazine Details James Truman was quoted in 1993, \"To me the thing about grunge is it's not anti-fashion, it's unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it's crazy for it to become a fashion statement.\" Men often wore oversized t-shirts, flannel shirts (that would be tied off around the waist when it got too hot), ripped jeans, and combat boots. These were considered timeless looks and were generally durable and reliable clothing to wear. Women tended to favor slip dresses, flannel shirts, ripped jeans, chokers, and the bell-bottoms/babydoll t-shirt was a popular combination as well. For more feminine, edgy fashion, however, there was also the Kinderwhore aesthetic, popularized by Courtney Love, who was Kurt Cobain's wife. The music of grunge was a blend of heavy metal sound and punk rock ethos. Pastel Grunge is an aesthetic that rose to prominence on Tumblr under the tags 'pastel grunge', '2014 tumblr', 'Lana del Rey aesthetic', and others. It's closely related to 2014 Tumblr. This aesthetic takes the edgier, more rough side of Grunge and other more hardcore aesthetics, and combines them with the softer, more romantic, and feminine aspects of styles such as Pastel Goth. It's also influenced by the Heroin Chic style of the 1990s, and, as the name states, Grunge. Soft Grunge or Pale Grunge is an aesthetic based on simple photos with a color palette primarily consisting of white, grey, black, green, and blue. The aesthetic is believed to have appeared on Tumblr between 2013 and 2015. Some photos are intended to be sad-looking, often of someone suffering for love or with a '90s vibe, for example.

The aesthetic is often conflated with the Yami Kawaii, which centers around illustrations depicting dark mental health topics in a cute anime-style, but Gurokawa has more of a traditional horror theme to it with typical spooky motifs. It isn't known when Gurokawa was given its name, but the aesthetic seems to have first spread in popularity during the early 2000s fueled by the works of the manga artist Junko Mizuno as well as the Happy Tree Friends cartoon series. Later in 2010, the debut of Japanese singer Kyary Pamyu Pamyu with her music video \"PONPONPON\" caused a major boom with Gurokawa goods being sold all over the world, spreading the aesthetic in an easy-to-understand manner. Gurokawa takes advantage of the expectation that cute themes also feature cute characters and visa versa by twisting it. Not only are there many depictions of monsters with an overly cute appearance, but also adorable mascot characters enganging in violent and cruel behavior.[2] Bloodstains, dripping blood, bats, ghosts, and all kinds of strange creatures are common motifs. Gloomy Bear Gloomy Bear is a cute-looking but violent pink bear that eats humans. The character was created by illustrator Mori Chack. Gloomy is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs as much as 2,000 pomegranates. Owned by a human named Pitty, he’s well trained for the most part, but he can never remember that he’s not supposed to attack humans. Still, a pet owner must take ultimate responsibility for his pets. Recalling warm memories of Gloomy as a cute cub, Pitty tries to lead a life of peaceful co-existence with his violent pet bear. Eyeballs Eyeballs as motifs and accessories are popular within the Gurokawa fashion and other similar fashions, such as Decora. They became widespread during 2010s, popularised by music and fashion icon Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, who often featured them in her outfits and music videos. Eyeballs can be seen on prints, hair accessories, and jewelery. Similar to Decora, Gurokawa has a strong focus on gaudy prints and accessories rather than a particular style of clothing. They commonly feature internal organs and other parts of the body, but cutified monsters are a common theme as well. While the combination of black with bright colors is the most common, there generally is no limitation on using pastels or any other color combination. Fake blood is commonly used not only for the clothes, but also parts of the make-up. Popular artists within Gurokawa include: External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

While gyaru is generally associated with a particular style, the importance lies in the bold makeup and overall vibe of the outfits rather than wearing a specific fashion. The point is to challenge societal norms by embracing a bold and unapologetic identity that stands out in the crowd. The term \"Gyaru\" is derived from the Japanese spelling of the English word \"gal\". When it first came into use in Japan during the 1970s, it was mainly used to refer to young, lively women. Only during the 1990s, after Gyaru’s predecessor Bodikon spread in popularity, the term became associated with the subculture of the same name, which highly attracted the attention of the media due to the sheer amount of its followers in Shibuya with their heavy makeup and bleached hair. This specifically happened when Bodikon began to “radicalise” (the look became more extreme, with dyed “chapatsu” (brown), red, and blonde hair, and tanned skin, with barely-there clothing). Before it became a subculture, the style was mainly associated with the fans of the Japanese singer Namie Amuro, who was embracing her tan typical for Okinawans in a time where pale skin was the norm, and the fans imitating her style. At the height of its popularity, it was not rare to see celebrities (not even just Japanese ones) sporting this style. The tanned skin, big hair, and rebellious outfits went highly against the traditional Japanese beauty standards. While Gyaru appeared very extreme in the past, it toned down as time went on. This can be attributed to a couple of factors; the ageing of many \"original\" Gyaru from the 1990s and early 2000s into middle-aged people, the continued recession in Japan resulting in a \"fatigue\" of extreme styles, and the increasingly tame beauty standards of young Japanese people today. Since the 2020s, there has been a renewed interest in Gyaru fueled by the Heisei Retro boom causing a increased demand for nostalgic styles that were prevalent during the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, to an extent, the outfits have toned down a bit, especially in Japanese communities, with younger “reiwa” gyaru, meaning those who got into the subculture as of 2019, having stark differences to the older “heisei” gyaru. There has also been other changes in the community, like a preference for online shopping on fast fashion sites like Shein rather than shopping for brands in malls, interacting with other gyaru on social media rather than meeting up in public, International/online gal circles becoming more popular, and vlogging and posting on places like Instagram and Tiktok as opposed to blogging. While printed media dedicated to gyaru has mostly become a thing of the past over being able to catch up with the constantly changing trends, there are multiple online magazines \"by the community for the community\" where gals have taken informing about the latest news within the subculture into their own hands. “Neo-Gyaru” is an attempt to revitalize the Gyaru style, ongoing since around the late 2010s, during its decline. Neo-Gyaru is notable for its more international adherents when compared to original Gyaru. But when the style reached popularity or even realization that it existed, the Gyaru community reacted in a completely different way then what some anticipated; they completely shunned the style. However, those who were wearing said fashion were not using the same fashion style as before or in its traditional form from apparel to their makeup. While Gyaru is mainly defined by its overall styling instead of the clothes worn, there's multiple styles popular among the subculture. Classic American Casual (Amekaji) Gothic (Goshikku) Hostess (Agejo) Princess  (Hime) Rock (Rokku) Romantic (Roma) Makeup is a central facet of the Gyaru style, and is what separates the many varied fashions from other similar aesthetics. There are differences in makeup depending on the era, but both old and modern Gyaru styling has in common that the focus on eye-enlarging makeup. In the past, this was archived by drawing an exaggerated bottom lash line in combination with wearing multiple layers of fake lashes, but over the years it has become a lot more common to use circle lenses in combination with \"eye bag\" makeup for a similar effect. As Gyaru is opposing traditional Japanese beauty standards, there are many people who bleach their hair to an unnatural shade of blonde, but pink and silver dyes are also popular. There is a tendency for wavy-to-curly hairstyles, with long hair being the most popular as it is easier to accessorize. This list contains works that either center around Gyaru or are heavily inspired by its aesthetic.

Typically, Gyaruo have similar elements to their appearance with Gyaru in terms of having high volume styled hair, trendy fashion styles, and sometimes tanned skin. Fashion Throughout the history of gyaru, it has always been seen as controversial both in Japan and internationally for several reasons. Compensated dating In Japan, during the 90s, the style Kogyaru was associated with enjo kōsai, also known as compensated dating. Some high school girls would perform sexual services or go on dates with older men in exchange for money or luxury goods. Although not all kogyaru do this, due to the subculture's bad reputation and the associated stereotypes alongside it, they were often criticized for it. Overtanning vs Blackface Ganguro and its subcategories are known for their heavy tan, sometimes to the point where outsiders to the subculture claim they are trying to look like a different race, specifically targeting Black people. However, with Ganguro being long past its heyday and almost extinct, having an overly unnatural tan is rarely seen nowadays. There also has been controversy about Gyaru wearing B-Kei fashion as the tanned skin in combination with hip-hop style fashion could be interpreted as cultural appropriation, even though the fashion style is now extremely rare. Association with the Bimbo aesthetic Due to its similarities to depictions of bimbos, such as having tanned skin, blonde/colorful hair, promoting sex positivity, wearing flashy clothes/accessories, and materialistic ideals, many have associated gyaru with bimbos, even mixing the two. This has caused controversy in the gyaru community, as even though the subculture is technically sex-positive, it is not the same as bimbo culture, and many do not want to associate with it due to its connotations, along with the fact that gyaru is not inherently sexual, as well as many gyarus being minors. However, there is still a community of gyaru who do not mind being associated with the term, and even identify as bimbos themselves. \"Mean Girl/Bully\" Stereotype Often times in media, especially media made by non-gals, gyarus are misrepresented and given the \"mean/popular girl\" trope. This may be due to the fact that the gyaru style is inspired by what many would consider \"the popular girl\" in western movies. Gyarus are often shown to be bullies who are overly concerned with the way they look and are narcissistic. They are also shown to be promiscuous and are either obsessed with boys or are seen as attractive by them. Sometimes they have their own \"clique\" (similar to how actual gals have gal circles) where they gossip, are always on their phones, and are rude to what many would see as otaku. A popular example of this stereotype would be the Bullies from Yandere Simulator (displayed in the gallery below). Although these stereotypes are technically not true, gals are known for being very blunt and honest, which could have been the reason for this stereotype existing in the first place. It is also of note that, just like any other community, rude gyaru exist, but they do not speak for all the community. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

It often centers around boy bands made up of Khonminam (flower boys), who are are pretty, androgynous young men whose style is influenced by shoujo and bishounen and is catered towards the female-gaze. They typically have perfectly styled/dyed hair, light makeup, small jewelry (usually a singular earring), and wear variations upon suit stylings. Visually, it also takes influence from J-Pop (particularly artists such as Gakct), which is in itself descendant from the West’s New Romantic/Synthpop bands, most specifically Duran Duran and Japan the Band. Stan (n): Refers to fans of any celebrity or media figure. The term originally came from Eminem’s song “Stan\" but the original negative meaning has evolved over time. \"There are so many K-pop stans.\" Stan (v): To stan something means to passionately support and enjoy it, similar to fangirling/fanboying. \"This group is so good, I should stan them.\" Bias (n): Your favorite member in a group. \"All the members in 1TEAM are good, but I think Je Hyun is my bias.\" Stream (v): To stream means to view it repeatedly to help increase the view count. \"Stream Lit so it reaches 15 million views!\" Koreaboo (n): A name given to non-Koreans who pretend to be Korean and worship Korean people.  It is a play on the term \"weeaboo\", which is used to describe a non-Japanese person trying to be Japanese. This term does not refer to normal K-pop and K-drama stans - Koreaboos are looked down upon in the K-pop and K-drama community due to their fetishization of Koreans and/or East Asians in general.\"Koreaboos are creepy people.\" K-fashion is usually characterized by kawaii fashion, pastel themes, long skirts and dresses, many accessories and Korean beauty trends. Koreawave is more of a fashion and media aesthetic. Idol fashion is inspired by the stage outfits that K-pop idols typically wear on stage during their performances. Since these styles are put together by stylists and each stage is styled specifically depending on the song and the concept, they take inspiration from nearly every fashion aesthetic. Korean Dramas have exploded in popularity in recent years, with international brands such as Netflix making them available to the general public outside of South Korea. Romantic dramas and Dramedies are the most popular of these shows. Movies are also a part of this aesthetic, both those originating within South Korea and the ones made by the Korean diaspora as a whole. Films such as the Oscar Winning Parasite have gained International Praise and entering the greater sphere of pop culture. K-pop is a genre of popular music originating in South Korea. While the modern form of K-pop can be traced back to the early 90s, the term itself has been popularized since the 2000s, replacing the term Gayo, which also refers to domestic pop music in South Korea. Although it generally indicates \"popular music\" within South Korea, the term is often used in a narrower sense to describe a modern form of South Korean pop that is influenced by styles and genres from around the world, such as experimental, rock, jazz, gospel, hip hop, R&B, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots. K-pop often refers to the idol groups or idol soloists in Korea, though most K-music has now been categorized as K-pop. The more modern form K-pop emerged with the formation of one of the earliest K-pop groups, Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene. Some other genres of k-music include:",

Health Goth has roots in \"street goth\" but focuses on trans-humanism, net art, technical sportswear, bionic body parts, combat gear and an understanding of physical and mental health. There is another unrelated variation of Health Goth that is focused more on combining the goth aesthetic with a more sporty aesthetic and focusing more on physical excersise. This is not considered a part of the original Goth/Batcave scene in any way. The term \"Health Goth\" originated from Portland artists Mike Grabarek and Jeremy Scott (also known as Magic Fades), and artist Chris Cantino who started the original Health Goth Facebook community in 2013. They have stated that: \"A lot of the influence comes from HOODBYAIR, Cottweiler, Whatever 21, and A D Y N.\" They also claim they were attributing a name to describe a feeling that already existed. \"When we started we’d just see an ad or some clothes we liked, and we’d see something dark or sexual in them that wasn’t intended to be there. So really the subversive side was just portraying the ads in a new light, because we wished these aspects were intentional. Things sort of went from there.\" In addition to citing athletic wear, future fashion labels and the emotional spectrum, they also reference sources from other online movements and aesthetics; \"It’s not just the colour scheme, a lot of the stuff we post are just futuristic or healthy takes on goth style. We find equal inspiration in our Tumblr feed, where you see a lot of 3D rendered images, which have no people or clothing shown. Images of mesh, or a blade with a tribal pattern and a fern or something. It might not be evident upon looking at our page but a lot of our imagery is very net art inspired.\" The fitness variation of Health Goth was started by Johnny \"Deathface\" Love, a personal trainer based out of Los Angeles and has gotten coverage from several mainstream news outlets, including Huffington Post, the New York Times, Complex, BuzzFeed, Cosmopolitan, Style.com, and the Guardian, among others. Grabarek, Cantino, and Scott have stated that Health Goth \"has to do with our history of net art obsession and fascination with the rise of trans-humanism. We want to create art that references evolution and relate it back to subcultures, things like bio-enhancement technology, anti-aging medication, and how it all feeds into this ideal of \"pursuing perfection\". We embrace a lot of these futuristic fantasies but ultimately we all have our own fears and doubts about it. So we like to blur the edges between things that are transcendental and taboo just enough that it begs a discussion.\" They later stated they were \"followers of the transhumanist movement\" and related their approach to a rejection of retro-fetishism: \"It's pretty fantastical when it comes down to it, and some may find that too strange or taboo, but we prefer that blurry, uncomfortable space over the conventional and twee bullshit you see everywhere.\" Health Goth was first blogged on AMDISCS who interpreted it as the following; \"Health Goth relies on an anti-nostalgic dystopian present, refracting the other by means of an exaggerated profile and tribal-aesthetics ... Health Goth projects a completely un-reflexive subjugation of the individual in the urban ecosystem ... It may be hyper-masculine on the surface, betraying a distinctively sus interior of body-mechanized cyborgian humanity within.\" The trend became viral and was featured prominently by publications such asVice, Huffington Post, Globe and Mail, The Guardian, i-D, Marie Claire, Esquire, Fader, Vogue, Complex, Nylon, GQ, New York Times (the NYT was particularly maligned by Grabarek, Cantino, and Scott), and many more. Health Goth was the #2 most Googled fashion trend of 2014, behind Normcore. Perhaps the most comprehensive analysis of health goth arrived with Adam Harper's article for The Fader deconstructing the trend. The article posited that health goth was a signifier of a post-genre world, in which aesthetics lead the way for subcultural and microgenre movements as they grow increasingly unique and amalgamated. The creators seemed to reflect this sentiment, as they stated in an article to Complex: \"Health Goth is not a lifestyle, it's an exercise in aesthetics. Any publication trying to tell you that Health Goth is about working out has simply taken the two words at face value and opted for a less challenging, and extremely boring alternative.\" Cantino, Grabarek, and Scott refused to suggest lifestyle tenets related to health goth, instead choosing to encourage viewers to \"simply pick and choose which elements they like.\" The creators have stated the following as keywords they use when sourcing imagery: Health Goth fashion is fully black and white, usually used as contrast to show a brand or pattern.

The Percy Jackson fandom who identifies as half-bloods sorted in the cabin of their \"god parent\" would also fit in this aesthetic perfectly. Many practicing occultists, pagans, and witches could be a fan of this aesthetic as they adopt Greek deities as their patron and matrons gods and goddesses, often involving them in their everyday lives. This can range from creating altars to communicating to them through divination. Learning about deities' associations, preferences, and mythos are key to connecting and working with them. Adopting positive traits and habits associated with a certain deity can bring one even closer to understanding that deity, also. This could mean practicing self-care and self-love in honor of Aphrodite, or working hard and honestly in school in honor of Athena, as examples.

This is a different aesthetic to Classicism, which is the history and culture of Ancient Greece and Rome, whereas this is a contemporary interpretation of Ancient Greek culture that came about from internet teens' renewed interest in mythology. Hellenic visuals typically express the aspects of the romanticised lifestyle of Ancient Greece. Visuals such as marble and items in Greek myths are shown.

This aesthetic was made by a transgender woman with the intention to romanticize both trans bodies and intersex bodies. Hermaphroditus was the son of Hermes and Aphrodite. Ovid's account relates that Hermaphroditus was nursed by naiads in the caves of Mount Ida, a sacred mountain in Phrygia (present day Turkey). At the age of fifteen, he grew bored with his surroundings and traveled to the cities of Lycia and Caria. It was in the woods of Caria, near Halicarnassus (modern Bodrum, Turkey) that he encounters the nymph Salmakis, who was overcome in lust for him. She tries to seduce him, but he rejected her. Shortly after, Hermaphroditus was bathing in a pool, when Salmacis, who was secretly watching him, jumped into it close to him, and asked the gods to unite them in only one body. From there, he becomes an androgynous being, usually represented as a woman with male genitalia. After his transformation, he prayed to his parents, asking them that anyone who bathed in the pool had the same fate as him, and his wish was granted.",

The visual style of the genre is mainly based on cover arts and music videos. it focuses on a low quality, dirty and melancholic style that evokes a feeling of nostalgia, mainly for the mid-to-late 2000s, incorporating highly edited and compressed images, photos of (mostly) female anime characters, references to videogame culture (mainly from the 2000s), and references to various styles and cultures, like Emo, Scene, Blingeecore, and Frutiger Aero. HexD began when various Experimental Hip Hop and Cloud rap artists formed a musical group called Hexcastcrew in 2019. This group was characterized by using an audio effect known as Bitcrush or Bitcrushing, which gave the tracks an old, sloppy lo-fi sound, plus the voices of the rappers of the group used to be altered to have a pitch higher than normal. This would give these songs a mysterious, ethereal and intriguing touch. The genre used to be quite niche and obscure at one point, but it wasn't until one of the group's members, tomoe_✧theundy1ng, better known as Stacy Minajj, released his DJ mix Rare RCB hexD.mp3, that the genre would take more notoriety within the community of underground rappers and hip hop artists on SoundCloud. The aforementioned DJ mix was a collection of remixed songs from another Cloud rap group known as Reptilian Club Boyz (RCB); these songs were remixed in the style of HexD, with lo-fi and bitcrushing effects, sped up tracks, and altered pitch. At the beginning, HexD was just another style within hip hop and was limited only to subgenres of hip hop, but slowly, the genre would begin to evolve and merge with other musical styles, specifically artists like Sienna Sleep and Exodia who would mix HexD with Hard trance, Freeform hardcore, and other EDM styles resulting in Sextrance as a result of this multiple genre combination. Besides Sextrance, HexD has served as the basis and insipiration for other musical genres, the most popular ones being Krushclub and Sigilkore, which share similar sound and visual style bases.

It also involves hiking as well. Hikecore relies on appreciation for nature and hiking. Those who belong to the hikecore aesthetic are generally accepting of all things natural and encourage a healthy relationship with the world around them. They enjoy casual/practical clothing with a whimsical outdoorsy touch. This is very similar to adventurecore, but hikecore takes place in purely forests and campgrounds. Adventurecore can take place in jungles and various other places. Hikecore can be considered to be a type of adventurecore, but they are not the same. Hikecore visuals often portray mountains and other outdoor areas. Imagery of long hiking trails and large grassy meadows is not uncommon, as well as visuals of the sky and clouds. Images of animals that one might come across whilst hiking, such as birds, deer, squirrels, and foxes. Hikecore fashion consists of mostly, if not entirely, hiking gear. Stuff like hiking boots, practical clothing, coats, multiple layers, and accessories such as backpacks, bags, compass, knives, and hiking sticks. Colors include earthy tones, such as brown, beige, black, greys, dark greens, greens, navies, and greys. It is important to keep the natural, simple feel to clothing, but to embrace that humans are a part of nature.",

It has four key stylistic elements. These include MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing (something that came about thanks to Brazilian immigrants of the time practicing their native martial art, Capoeira, out in the streets), and graffiti/graff/writing, other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing. While hip-hop has evolved considerably away from the streets of the Bronx, it has become perhaps the biggest genre of music in the world, welcoming any and all into its fold if they have the skills to stand out, even with the much-maligned \"Mumble Rap\" and \"Trap\" that is currently popular right now, the spirit of DIY that permeates Hip-Hop is alive and well in the new generation. A lot of Hip-Hop visuals share a lot in common with Urbancore aesthetics, with things like graffiti and urban neighborhoods showing up a lot in Hip-Hop visuals.  Among that, there's also nods to vinyl records, DJs, B-Boys/B-Girls, and elements of the original hip-hop, elements of gang culture like guns, drugs, women, alcohol, and death that accompanied the Gangsta rap era of hip-hop, and even the modern era where it seems to be all luxury item labels on everything; be it clothing, jewelry, cars, etc. Hip hop fashion has changed over the years, with the style now being more of a high-end streetwear look. Due to the 90's Revival, 80's, 90's and early 2000's hip hop looks have been coming back into style (this does not mean that modern hip-hop fashion is out of style, it is just more common). 70's, 80's, 90's and early 2000's hip hop fashion usually consisted of affordable, oversized clothes (for both men and women) because 1) they were always moving and needed to be comfortable all the time and 2) youth in the Bronx didn't have much control over where they lived, so fashion gave them lots of freedom; as we moved into the 2000s women began wearing more dresses and heels. Sneakers were common, but skate shoes and high top Doc Martens have been seen as well. Successful rappers put lots of emphasis on jewelry and displayed their riches through \"iced out' rings, chains, and even on their teeth (grills). In the late 90s and early 2000s hip hop fashion became popular and recognized by high-end brands, it wasn't uncommon to see rappers wearing a brand name article of clothing and a plain pair of pants, or a fashionable pair of sneakers and a run-of-the-mill tracksuit. Hip hop fashion today tends to gravitate towards higher-end brands (e.g Nike) and sportswear-type outfits commonly found on the streetwear scene. A majority of the fashion stays baggy, breathable and fashionable. By all means, if you can think of an artist to include on here, feel free to include their name on this list. Hip-hop comes in a variety of forms and from many nations worldwide. However, as we are unable to cover them all, please feel free to suggest a subgenre and mention the name of the artist behind it. Chinese Hip Hop is a subgenre of Hip-Hop music that is in Chinese and blends in various Chinese street culture elements. Some popular Chinese Hip Hop artists include: Gangsta Rap is an subgenre of Hip-Hop that is characterized by the violent lifestyle of youth from underprivileged areas of the principal coasts of U.S.A like Long Island or Compton. It was prevalent during mid 80's to late 90's. Gangsta is from the word gangster.  For more information, please read our Gangsta Rap page.

It is broadly associated with indie and alternative music and genres, such as jazz, folk, indie rock, and electronic rock. Hipsters also frequently flaunt a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility, wearing vintage and thrifted clothing; hold pacifist and green views; are often vegan; consume organic and artisanal foods, and craft alcoholic beverages; and live alternative lifestyles. The roots of the hipster aesthetic date back to the 1940s, but the modern-day version did not reach the height of its popularity until the late 2000s to early 2010s.[1] The term \"hipster\" originated in the late 1930s and was popularized in the early '40s to describe jazz fans, a variation on the earlier \"hepster\" or \"hep cat.\" Cab Calloway's A Hepster's Dictionary was published in 1938 as a guide to jazz slang. A mention of the musical superstar's book in the New York Amsterdam News, in which it was misprinted as A Hipster's Dictionary, may have popularized the spelling with an I.[2] Hipsters of this era were stereotyped as white fans of jazz music produced by Black artists, which led to their adopting terms and styles from African-American jive culture. These hipsters were notable for preferring styles like hot jazz, cool jazz, and bebop, popular among Black audiences, over the big band swing music that was more popular among  white audiences. This division shows an early form of the line between the \"cool,\" \"hip,\" \"indie,\" or \"alternative,\" and the \"mainstream\" or \"square,\" a line which would become crucial to understandings of hipster identity then and later. '40s hipsters sometimes sought to emulate their heroes and further reject mainstream white American culture by embracing a relaxed attitude, bohemian living, liberal sexuality, and drug use. Beat writers like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg described the hipster culture of their era while writing in the late '40s and early '50s. Their writings would play a part in the creation of 21st-century hipster culture.[3] Though the term \"hipster\" fell out of fashion with the decline of the jazz era and increasing mainstream mocking of \"beatniks,\" the hippie (linguistically derived from hipster) counterculture of the '60s proved influential to the 21st-century hipster. Inspiration came from the Beats of recent decades, as well as the psychedelia and Eastern philosophy advocated by writers like Aldous Huxley and artists like the Beatles. Hippies embraced alternative lifestyles, drug use, free love, and an attitude of protest against the conservative American and British establishment. Many 21st-century hipsters draw aesthetic or philosophical inspiration from the hippie movement. Many musical artists such as Bob Dylan, The Beatles, The Doors, and The Velvet Underground, who shared associations with the psychedelic, pacifist, and protest-oriented hippie movement, would become anemoiac favourites of later hipsters.[4] The contemporary hipster subculture evolved somewhat out of the Grunge subculture. Grunge featured an anti-consumerist drive to defy orthodox fashion by embracing cheap, well-worn, and untailored clothing. Grunge declined in the late 90s as it was commercialized and many of the bands at its centre dissolved, but this ethos would carry on into the roots of hipster culture in the early 2000s, cementing eclectic, anticonsumerist thrift fashion as a core tenet of the hipster aesthetic. Flannel shirts, a central part of any grunge outfit, would endure as a hipster favourite. The indie rock and folk music of the hipster movement also owes its often intentionally unrefined and authentic rough quality to its roots in grunge, although the more acoustic or electronic sound may be very different from grunge movement. Also around this time, Indie music began emerging such as Pavement, Neutral Milk Hotel, and Radiohead which could be considered a precursor to modern hipster. Somewhere around the late '90s and very early 2000s, late Gen X grunge adherents gave way to early millennial hipster pioneers. It's been said that where grunge was a reaction against the yuppie culture and conservatism of the Reagan-Thatcher era, early hipsterism was a reaction to the Bush era, rising in the United States as a reaction to conservative trends following the 9/11 attacks. For a time, the term \"hipster\" referred to people in different urban subcultures, including fans of vintage fashion, punk, and other groups that were simultaneously attractive and too niche for the mainstream. However, what distinguishes the hipster from a person who is a part of these subcultures is the lack of values and instead a preference for the aesthetic elements, in effect being posers[5]. The term \"hipster\" rose to prominence a second time in the mid-late 2000s to describe liberal and artsy residents of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Robert Lanham's 2003 book The Hipster Handbook popularized the term. It spread rapidly, and was soon used to describe similar residents of London's hip, gentrified Shoreditch neighbourhood, and similar neighbourhoods in such hipster hotspots as Berlin, Seattle, Vancouver, and Montreal. New movements of the 2000s became tied into the hipster subculture. Craft or \"micro\" brewing grew quickly from the mid-2000s to early 2010s, displacing mainstream \"macro\" beers as the drink of choice for young adults in hip areas. At the same time, the craft cocktail revolution and a greater interest in all things \"artisanal\" and hand-crafted became prominent. A boom in indie music such as Modest Mouse and The Killers, speculated to be related to the financial struggles of larger labels due to internet music piracy, provided an eagerly embraced soundtrack to the culture. Movies with an \"indie\" aesthetic achieved mainstream recognition such as Garden State, The Life Aquatic, and Superbad. Growing social movements of the 2000s such as the gay pride movement and environmental consciousness were embraced by hipsters as a means of demonstrating their progressive ideologies. The idea of the hipster was codified and homogenized through the decade to feature interest in vintage fashion, indie music, fixie bicycles appropriated from bike courier culture, and craft beer. As these signifiers grew more identifiable, they became the main things associated with the hipster label. A thesis statement of late Hipsterdom could be taken from The Suburbs, a very hipster-associated 2010 album by very hipster-associated band Arcade Fire: \"When we watched the markets crash/the promises we made were torn/ (...) Some people say we've already lost/But they're afraid to pay the cost\" In other words, the Great Recession of 2008 provided fertile ground for the popularization of hipster thought. Millennials frequently found themselves disillusioned with ladder-climbing capitalist attitudes in the wake of the recession. Instead they rejected corporatism and sought out more natural, timeless aesthetics. The Indie Sleaze era was popularized through artists like LCD Soundsystem and Arcade Fire. New hipster meccas like Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas emerged where low rent allowed purposefully lower-paid Millennials to live more bohemian lifestyles and enjoy artistic pursuits. The dream of the 90s, they said, was alive in Portland.[6] As the hipster aesthetic grew, its signifiers began to enter mainstream culture, with \"hipster\" becoming a codified and recognizable costume. While this encouraged more people to enjoy the aesthetic, it may have been the cause of its end. An aesthetic founded on defying the mainstream, after all, is at an impasse when it becomes itself the mainstream zeitgeist. Google Trends shows that searches for the word \"hipster\" between 2004 and the present peaked in 2012 in the United States and 2015 worldwide.[7] [8] However, articles with titles like \"What was the hipster?\" were being published as early as 2010.[9] The exact decline of the hipster era is difficult to delineate. As \"the hipster\" became a codified costume and aesthetic, it grew distanced from its former political associations of socially liberal causes. Criticisms of white-centric, male-focused, and culturally appropriative aspects of the aesthetic emerged. In many cases, hipster signifiers didn't necessarily fade from culture, but faded from positions of unique cultural significance. Indie music grew so produced as to blur the line with pop, as artists like Lorde achieved huge commercial success in what would formerly have been considered an indie sound. In the mid-2010s, Indie Sleaze gave way to \"stomp clap hey\" Indie Folk such as The Chainsmokers and The Lumineers. Being so promoted in the mainstream, this could hardly be called hipster. Craft beer eclipsed macro brands as the ubiquitous choice for drinkers around the world. Facial hair, bangs, flannel, skinny jeans, large glasses, and other anachronistic or counter-cultural styles became more accepted as business casual looks. When everyone became a hipster, perhaps, that meant that no one was. Any aesthetic which prides itself on being distinct from the cultural sphere would inevitably face a crisis of identity upon becoming a central focus of that sphere. As new aesthetics emerged in the late 2010s, the hipster as a distinct entity faded somewhat from the public consciousness.  The 2016 election of Donald Trump and the 2017 finale of Portlandia have sometimes been cited as an end to this era. The 2020s saw a renewed nostalgic interest in the hipster culture of the 2000s and early 2010s, largely from Generation Z internet users who had been quite young at the time. Indie Sleaze was codified as an aesthetic summation of early-hipster party culture, though its accuracy has been questioned.[10][11] Twee aesthetics associated with hipster culture were remembered nostalgically. Tumblr users in particular began to reminisce about 2014 Tumblr culture, a young person's view of the late-hipster era, though as related above, core hipster culture was declining somewhat through a merger with the mainstream by 2014. Hipster philosophy is centred around ideals of authenticity, artistry, independence, free thought, and rejection of mainstream commercialized mores of society. The archetypal hipster rejects the idea that commercial success or capitalist entrenchment is an indication of a thing's quality, and may very likely hold the opposite to be true. The adherent of hipster philosophy would claim that quality and authenticity can only be achieved by breaking away from the limits of that which is produced by large corporations and a soulless capitalist society. That which is hipster theoretically exists in dichotomous opposition to that which is mass-produced, corporate, designed for mass appeal, and is therefore artificial. The hipster fundamentally believes that authentic human artistry, creativity, and soul imbibe a thing with inherently superior quality to objects of mainstream commercialism. This can be seen in the hipster love of indie and low-production music, film, and art, as well as in intentionally, anachronistic, tacky, or lower-end fashion, which shows rejection of mainstream fast fashion and corporate-driven trends. Hipsters believe in being bohemian in lifestyle but nonetheless educated and worldly, in tune with the issues that face the planet. Travel, especially backpacking and hostel travel in which the traveller experiences what could be seen as a more authentic view of the world, is considered very valuable. Experiencing art, film, music, and writing which presents complex or challenging ideas is likewise considered important.  Hipsters pride themselves on being well-read and are likely to gravitate towards creative and artistic fields. The hipster is fundamentally romantic rather than pragmatic, though it may be a form of romanticism hidden beneath a veneer of irony, which comes from a disdain for the less artistic mainstream. The term \"hipster\" is often used as a pejorative, to denigrate a person seen as being focused on surface-level coolness and visible difference from the mainstream for ironic purposes. However, many of those proclaimed as hipsters in the pejorative sense would either reject the label or refute its aptness. As a rejection of mainstream society involves a rejection of labels, self-proclaimed hipsters are rare; though many may identify with the label, there exists a certain taboo among \"hipsters\" against stating one's own desire to be seen as a hipster, due to its commonly pejorative nature. Irony is common in hipster thought, but the degree to which irony dominates hipster thought varies among individuals and remains a source of debate. Some schools of thought hold that cynical irony is a hallmark of hipster attitude because it serves as contrast to the artificially peppy mood of mainstream corporatism and advertising. The visuals of hipsterdom can vary broadly, as the term designates a philosophy and view of culture more than any particular visual aesthetic. Contrasting colours, thrifted clothing, and intentionally unfashionable outfits mark the more punk, grunge, and indie-aligned aspect of hipster culture. Beanies, scarves, flannel, and ripped skinny jeans tend to be prominent in this look. As lower production value and higher artistic integrity is valued by hipsters, the philosophy can be associated with lo-fi photography and film or the sincere simplicity of hand-drawn line art. Hipster value worldly education, so books, glasses, and art are prominent as signifiers of intellectual pedigree. Coffee shops and book stores became associated with hipsters in part due to their historical status as places of intellectual discussion and art. Brew pubs were a more casual equivalent that still exemplified appreciation for that which was authentic and homemade. Twee aesthetics were well aligned with hipsters. Movies like Little Miss Sunshine, 500 Days of Summer, and the filmography of Wes Anderson imparted a vintage-cute, somewhat nerdy and quirky aesthetic to the hipster style, especially for women. Sundresses, flower crowns, Peter Pan collars, film cameras, vinyl records,  and fixie bicycles bridged the shrinking gap between the twee and the hip. Later hipsterism associated with indie-folk and the Pacific Northwest, though it would spread beyond these origins, would embrace what was sometimes called a lumbersexual aesthetic. This featured visuals associated with woodsmen and mountain men: flannel, especially red buffalo check, suspenders, rough wood (or perhaps Ragged Wood,) coniferous trees, mountains, leather, acoustic instruments, and large beards or mustaches. Deer, bird, and other woodland animal motifs were associated with this style, which could be considered intersectional with Campcore, Cabincore, or Adventurecore.[12] Hipster Fashion revolves around the idea of rejecting the mainstream trends and using unique or quirky items to define an outfit. This can range from hairstyles and facial hair to socks. Rejecting unsustainable and uninspired mainstream fast fashion, hipsters will often shop at thrift stores or make use of vintage items. Contrasting and layering items together, especially those that may be traditionally seen as being part of different styles, is the way to create a hipster outfit. Tattoos are popular. Flannel shirts are an archetypical symbol of lumbersexual-style hipster outfits. More urban styles may go for vintage t-shirts, especially with unique or anachronistic imagery (vinyl decals, typewriter font, etc.) V-neck t-shirts have been associated with a hipster look. Vests, sweaters, suspenders, blazers, and zip-up hoodies could all be layered with these bases. Skinny jeans are the standard hipster bottoms. If standard blue jeans, these are more likely to be a darker wash, though they can also be distinct and brightly coloured. Some hipsters, especially those inclined to something of the twee aesthetic, may be fond of sundresses and flowing skirts - the hippie inspiration factors in here. Depending on the hipster outfit, different shoes may be an essential part. Men's patterned leather brogues, Converse-style sneakers, or leather desert boots can be worn. Unique, patterned, brightly colored, or mismatched socks can be worn with these shoes. Moustaches and full beards are considered a distinctive hipster marker. It could be said that a hipster outfit is truly made by trimming it with unique and quirky accessories. These might include: Media associated with and beloved by hipsters is wide-ranging and diverse. Many genres and styles may be represented. The common factor is that hipsters value art and media produced and consumed outside of the mainstream, which would be expected to show a stronger sense of authorship, less sense of being produced by a focus group for mass appeal, and therefore may not be as widely known in popular culture. Stories about outsiders or those who have trouble fitting into societal norms have built-in hipster appeal. Certain authors are beloved by hipsters for their strong sense of style, offbeat worldviews and characters, counter-cultural ethos, or esoteric and artistic writing. By author surname, some examples might be: Music is one of the most fundamental parts of the hipster subculture. As hipsters value artistry and uniqueness over commercially produced mainstream music, \"hipster music\" could include a broad spectrum of styles, though certain genres rise to prominence in association with the archetypal hipster of various eras. Hipsters stereotypically love vinyl records, and prefer to listen to music live or in analog formats. A surefire source of hipster cred is an association with music, the more offbeat the better. Hipsters like music, but the hippest hipster knows all about the most unexpected and strange subgenres. Hipsters may play music, but the hippest hipster may play strange and unexpected instruments like the singing saw or hurdy-gurdy. The term \"hipster\" originally described jazz fans of the 1940s and 50s. Modern hipsters may share a love of the genre, or else appreciate it for its role in the origins of hipster counterculture, or for its vintage associations. Hipster-beloved jazz artists might include Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Ella Fitzgerald, Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Dave Brubeck, or Louis Armstrong. As hipster subculture took a new form around the turn of the millennium, it became associated with late 90s and 2000s indie rock scene. Offbeat and unusual rock bands signed to smaller record labels defined the musical hipster as known today. Neutral Milk Hotel's lyrically esoteric and anachronistically-instrumented album In the Aeroplane Over the Sea has been described as \"The Bible for hipsters.\"[16] Other artists producing diverse sounds and moods formed a broad canon of hipster indie rock. Artists of this genre beloved by hipsters could include: The 21st-century Hipster revival and its love of all things vintage and genuine also saw hipsters scouring used record shops to discover artists prominent in past decades whose music had overall or in part been overlooked by the canonization of mainstream classic rock. Hipster classic rock, by definition, isn't what would be heard on a commercial classic rock radio. A hipster's classic rock playlist might include overlooked 1960s-80s deep cuts by Bob Dylan, The Beatles, The Velvet Underground, David Bowie, Cat Stevens, Neil Young, Talking Heads, The Smiths, or Sonic Youth. The growth of hipster subculture in the late 2000s coincided with the growth of indie-folk music, which blended folk traditions and acoustic instrumentation with hipster-beloved  indie rock style, sometimes differentiated as \"hippie-sters.\"[19] This style has also been jokingly referred to as \"stomp clap hey\" music. Early innovators in the subgenre like Bon Iver, Fleet Foxes and Iron and Wine gave rise to more mainstream \"folk-pop\" acts like Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes, Mumford & Sons, The Lumineers, Of Monsters and Men, The Head and the Heart, and Vance Joy. As this music period featured the greatest merging of hipster and mainstream styles, these artists are among the most visible representations of hipster music from an outside perspective, and therefore are often cited as representative of the entire very diverse set of styles. It could be argued that as the term \"hipster\" usually defines an exception from the mainstream, especially in music, then a highly visible, commercially promoted, and accessible hipster artist represents an inherent contradiction.[20] Hipster aesthetic grew out of young urban alternative communities, and so activities suited to that lifestyle predominate how hipsters spend time. Making or listening to music, especially live in small clubs, cafés, or festivals, or in jam sessions at home, is a very hipster activity. The more the attendee can brag that not many people would know about an venue, artist, or event, the more the experience aligns with hipster ideals. If live music isn't available that night, then listening to vinyl records is the next best thing. Attending protests or campaigning for causes can be considered \"hipster,\" as hipsters are often socially active and aligned with progressive politics. Riding bicycles is a stereotypical hipster activity. Cycling is a mode of transportation that's better for the environment and better for the social fabric of dense cities than driving and car-centric infrastructure, and allows for more independent travel than relying on institutional highways and transit. For these reasons cycling may even be a social cause in itself. It's also the perfect way to show off one's hipster outfits, cruising by upright on a fixie or Dutch-style bike. Travelling is considered valuable to a well-rounded hipster lifestyle, especially backpacking, couchsurfing, hitchhiking, and such cheaper, more independent, and more \"authentic\" modes of travel. The hipster traveller is more likely to be found sleeping in dormitory hostels and eating in local markets than in all-inclusive resorts and high-end restaurants. Hipsters love to eat and drink at hip restaurants, bars, and cafés. If those places have brunch or craft beer, all the better. Simply hanging out in some places could be seen as a hipster activity. Brew pubs, independent coffeehouses, hip hole-in-the-wall restaurants, record shops, thrift and vintage shops, markets, independent bookstores, or accessible parks and plazas can all be beloved hipster spots. Many cities around the world have stereotypically \"hipster neighbourhoods\" where many of these spots can be found, and where young artists and independent professionals congregate. Below is a thorough but certainly non-exhaustive list of examples.[21][22][23][24][25] Cutester is an aesthetic that invokes the feeling (or appearance) of being cute. This applies to people who wear child-like clothing, acts in a way that invokes cuteness or anything of the sort. This is what it looks like when one takes the Kidcore aesthetic and added a few dashes into the Hipster aesthetic. A Fixed Gear Hipster (or fixie hipster) describes a hipster riding atop a fixed gear bicycle often termed as a fixie. Although, the heritage of fixed gear cycling dates to professional couriers, messengers, and track cycling. It is unclear how this style of cycling became popular with them. However, it is generally believed that owning a fixed-gear bicycle has been labeled \"trendy\" within hipster culture. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

There are multiple periods, each with different philosophies, artistic values, and notable people, which are described in the index. While these eras are distinct, contemporary Americans view these time periods as generally \"historical,\" with it being hard to relate to these peoples. They are made into heroes, inspirations, and points of interest, especially the Founding Fathers of the nation. The aesthetic is used to connect modern Americans with the people of the past in a desire to create national culture, connect with American values, and interest people in American history. Values do change throughout history, but there are motifs that are consistent in telling \"the American story.\" There is a constant struggle in establishing democracy, with historical periods generally characterized as different battles, such as creating it in the Revolutionary era and maintaining the Constitution in the Civil War era. Americans take great pride in their democratic history and the aesthetic functions as an artistic way to present that narrative and assert that there are no kings or great authorities like with France's Rococo. Another motif is the simultaneous fear and romanticization of nature. Forests, mountains, and rivers feature prominently in American art and it evokes adventure, mystery, and the supernatural in Romantic period literature and the journey of Louis and Clark. Later, n Manifest Destiny, nature also came to symbolize opportunity, destiny, and the heroism of the American people. Today, looking at historical objects, locations, and even re-enactments is an activity that many Americans (especially East Coast Americans) have experienced in their lives. The public school system utilizes the aesthetic to encourage more patriotism and interest in history in American children by arranging field trips, assigning art and research projects, and showing media set in the time period. In many states, this is a required part of the curriculum and many students enjoy these special events. It is also not uncommon for towns and cities of historical interest to have events centered around Historical Americana. Historical societies, tourism and recreation officials, and local museums would hold a festival on the anniversary of the notable event and have re-enactors, parades, and general festivities such as food stalls and street fairs. Historians may hold talks and local politicians may give speeches to unite the community. This page is under construction This page is under construction",

These images usually contain white or light pastel backgrounds that reflect off into rainbows. The objects/themes that are used often: holographic materialistic clothes, boots, bags, discs, crystals, marble floors, knives, sunglasses, jewels, shower tiles, glitter, mermaid merch, reflective water, the odd grid pattern, and edited swirled holographic. Holographic items are often confused with iridescent, multi-chrome, and any item with a shiny surface. They are different but can be confused with each other. Sometimes, if paired with lyrics or quotes, they are usually from artists such as Lana del Rey, Marina and the Diamonds, The Arctic Monkeys, Melanie Martinez, Billie Eilish, and Lorde. These artists tend to sing about their current situation and emotions, creating a zone of in the now, absorbed in the now. They talk very poetically, describing experiences quite deeply and eclectically. Some examples are moments when you are loving someone, how disastrous and messy they are, and what they want to or are doing right now. The font is also not attention-grabbing, but a simple cute font, whereas the soothing shiny iridescence is intended to be the real attention grabber. YouTuber SimplyNailogical is credited for giving the subculture the title 'Holosexuals'. She frequently describes herself and her viewers and fans as \"holosexual,\" obsessing over shiny nail polishes. There are two general subaesthetics in Holosexual visuals. Darker colors, black, and vibrant rainbow colors tend to be paired with sharp, retro-futuristic and futuristic visuals, while lighter colors, pastels, and silvers tend to be paired with small objects, especially jewelry and accessories. Both frequently feature patterns, fabrics, and lights. Holosexual visuals tend to be iridescent, color-shifting, glittery, and brightly colored. Common creatures seen in Holosexual aesthetics include unicorns, mermaids, and dolphins (especially in Seapunk aesthetics, which borrow from the Holosexuals). A majority of holosexual fashion is centered on make-up and nail polish, although there are examples of Holosexual clothing that exists out in the wild (and can even be bought on websites like Amazon). While most Holosexual fashion tends to skew towards more the feminine end of the gender spectrum, there are examples of male holosexual clothing out there, so the boys can have fun with this look, too. Holosexual fashion seems to be very common in Raver fashion, though some male holosexual fashion seems to take a lot of notes from '70s Disco fashion. In 2013, the company 3M (manufacturer of Scotch Tape) noticed an increased demand for iridescent coating, so they developed a dichroic adhesive that can be applied with heat and easily removed. This made smooth dichroic aesthetics more accessible to the everyday person, and there has been an explosion of applications, most notably in architecture and interior design. Under Construction",

It focuses on the human condition and the special everyday interactions with nature, other humans, and even inanimate objects. Hopecore is not necessarily religious but it definitely is spiritual and commonly accompanied by a strong sense of sonder. Hopecore reminds us that life is beautiful and fragile. Hopecore doesn't have a visual section as it is a philosophical aesthetic, but there are certain elements commonly seen in hopecore. There are five main concepts to keep in mind when talking about hopecore: Hope: Hope can function as a coping strategy: it allows you to focus on something positive even in times when everything seems negative, and it motivates you to ‘see the bright side’ of the situation. This helps you identify opportunities –however small– which may otherwise go unnoticed. It can also give you a boost in confidence, courage, and ambition. Hence, hope functions as a requisite to survive and thrive: hopeful people are quicker to recover from illness, and when someone ‘loses all hope’, they no longer want to live. This emotion is, however, relatively resilient (‘hope dies last’).[1] Sonder: The realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own — populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness — an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you'll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk. (via the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows).[2] Yūgen: Usually translated as “mysterious profundity.” It refers to the beauty that we can feel sense into an object, even though the beauty doesn’t exist in the literal sense of the word and cannot be seen directly. Yūgen is a sense not to enjoy the superficial beauty of an object, which is in front of our eyes but to enhance the beauty more impressive by imagining its latent beauty.[3] Humanity: It is a virtue linked with basic ethics of altruism derived from the human condition. It also symbolises human love and compassion towards each other.[4] Melancholy: It is not rage or bitterness; it is a noble species of sadness that arises when we are properly open to the idea that suffering and disappointment are at the heart of human experience. It is not a disorder that needs to be cured; it is a tender-hearted, calm, dispassionate acknowledgement of how much agony we will inevitably have to travel through.[5] Other less defined, yet just as important, concepts are little joys, random acts of kindness, the act of creation and existence. Hopecore has found its way into TikTok in the form of short videos comprised of emotional clips from movies, interviews and victories from sports or entertainment events (such as the Emmys or the Oscars), less commonly nature timelapses. These videos are accompanied by motivational music (very commonly My Way by Frank Sinatra) in the background. Web weaving (often hyphenated to \"web-weaving\") is - along with the fanmix, the moodboard, and specific music - a genre of transformative works of art, endemic to the internet blogging website tumblr. A web weaving is any combination of images (such as of famous paintings), captured still images from film or television, prose quotes, song lyrics, lines of poetry, and excerpts from film scripts, which have a theme in common, or a unifying set of symbols, and which are presented together in a sequence to be enjoyed as a coherent single work of art.[6] They are often meant to evoke either a sense of tenderness and hope or melancholy and sorrow, all emotions essential to hopecore. There is no one genre of music for hopecore, what's most important is the topics. The main topics being friendship, the beauty of life and love. Hopecore's aesthetics, however, are best suited to genres like Sunshine Pop, a pop subgenre that emphasizes appreciation for the beauty of the world. Blogs Rizvic, S. (2023, June 5).

Literary historian J. A. Cuddon defined the horror story as \"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length which shocks, or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it might be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society. As the entire point of Horror is to frighten the audience, Horror is often considered an extremely personal and diverse genre, as it depends on the fears and distastes of the viewer. There are many subgenres of Horror that focus in specific aesthetics and styles, including but not limited to Analog Horror, B-Movie Horror, Catholic Horror, Digital Horror, Gross-Out Horror, etc. Horror aesthetic visuals are designed to achieve some sort of element of discomfort, fear, disgust, or any sort of imagery that can trigger the \"fight or flight\" response people naturally have. This differs from the Halloween visual aesthetic because Halloween imagery tends to be sillier with its handling of macabre imagery, thus not being taken as seriously as it could when it's played straight in the Horror aesthetic. Horrorcore is a subgenre of Hip-Hop music based on horror-themed and often darkly transgressive lyrical content and imagery. Its origins derived from certain hardcore hip-hop and gangster rap artists, such as \nthe Ghetto Boys, which began to incorporate supernatural, occult, or psychological horror themes into their lyrics. Horror Punk, also associated with Deathrock, is a genre that mixes punk rock 1950s-influenced doo-wop and rockabilly sounds with morbid and violent imagery and lyrics which are often influenced by horror films and science fiction B-movies, literature and art. The music is also often accompanied by lyrics that explore themes of death, fear, and the supernatural. It was pioneered by the Misfits in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Outside of that, a lot of Horror music is mostly tense and orchestral by design, with some examples of it bleeding into the world of Rock and Metal. A lot of horror metal music will delve more into the realm of True Crime or the horrors of war, though some horror-based metal will draw upon classic works of horror literature or film, such as the band Ice Nine Kills.

Visually, it takes horror—especially cosmic or Lovecraftian horror—and applies it to academia, research, and learning. It takes inspiration from the exhaustion of being a student or researcher, the fear of failure, and the fear of the unknown, focusing specifically on cramped, dingy spaces, like libraries or archives, and leaning away from the more elegant gothic motifs that characterize Dark Academia or Darkest Academia. Horror academia is a dreary, depressing aesthetic that reflects the difficulty and laborious workload of real academia, manifesting in the spooky, grimdark, and monstrous horror ambience of the aesthetic. Common horror academia visuals include shadowy libraries or archives, stacks of books and papers, uncanny hallways, and coffee. Monsters or ghosts may accompany these things, but are not themselves horror academia. Dim lighting is a must, and bright colors are very rarely used. Horror academia is similar to dark and darkest academia, but focuses more on studiousness. It is grungier, creepier, and less Gothic. There is also less of a focus on architecture; in terms of space and location, horror academia is focused only on the spaces that hold knowledge, and generally stays away from the outdoors—horror academia students are too deep into the bowels of the library to hear the rain drumming on the roof. High-vaulted ceilings and sharp spires are more the realm of Darkest Academia. Horror academia has more of a fascination with battered, everyday objects and imperfections, meaning that there is not the same focus on classical art or statues, though these things can certainly be creepy. Horror academia is an everyday sort of horror. For the same reason, graveyards aren't particularly horror academia. Horror academia is a more modern aesthetic, though it is not necessarily set in modern day. The themes of horror academia are applicable to a wide range of time periods, but modern objects and locations are featured more often, with the romanticization of eras like the Victorian taking a backseat. While computers and smartphones often don't lend themselves well to a creepy aesthetic, they can absolutely be included if they are suitably dim or dingy—low brightness helps. Depictions of older devices such as cassette tapes, landline phones, CDs, and other older tech often suit this aesthetic better—the screech and skip of a scratched CD or the ambient whir of a tape recorder are very horror academic. Horror academia focuses more on nonfiction and research as topics of study. A horror academia student can be seen hunched over a science textbook, ancient historical tome, or psychological manual, typing away at a dim laptop as the sense of dread grows from something behind them. Horror academia students are too stressed to high-mindedly consider the themes of poetry or art—the closest they get is dutifully churning out a paper for their English class, or quickly shutting the a drawer on a figurine whose eyes seem to follow them, before returning to their other research. Unlike Darkest Academia, Goth, or Romantic Academia, Horror Academia is not about finding beauty in study—it is about commiserating the dark curiousity, grueling work, and willpower that go into the pursuit of knowledge. There is something strange and terrifying and interesting deep in the darkest part of the stacks, but to call it beautiful would be a lie. Existential fear, stress, and a sense of creeping dread make up the emotional core of horror academia. In addition, horror academia takes the messy, often-dysfunctional themes of Chaotic Academia and removes the rebellious joy. A horror academia student may have a desk teetering with books and papers, but they feel obsessive and guilty about it. They may be up at 3 in the morning, but they aren't out with their friends—they are alone with their books as the lines blur before their wavering, exhausted gaze and the shadows behind them reach out hungrily. One should not sleep-deprive, overwork, or otherwise negatively affect oneself in the pursuit of becoming a horror academic. Horror academia exists as a reflection of the pressures of academia and study and not as something to negatively aspire to. You can (and should) absolutely appreciate the grimdark, grungy, and spooky aesthetic while still being a healthy student. Horror academia is less fashion-focused than other academias. Horror academia fashion is characterized by an exhausted or disheveled appearance. Clothes should be in a muted or neutral color palette, but the idea is mostly to look like you are too harried by the stress of your deadlines and the ghosts possessing your books to worry about your appearance. The thrift-store, worn-to-pieces is somewhat similar to Grunge, and the style as a whole is also similar to Chaotic Academia, though with even less of the refinement of Dark Academia. Audio Dramas Horror academia music is creepy, discomfiting, and rarely relaxing. Even pieces that are melodic have a distinct creepy feel. Horror academia music can be from any time period and feature any instruments. It may also be experimental or discordant, like George Crumb's Black Angels. These are extended soundscapes featuring the sounds of libraries, archives or offices, often with a creepy twist.",

Seen as the epicenter for many an aesthetic popular throughout the 90's and into the present day, Hot Topic has faced criticism for being both a bandwagon rider in terms of what's popular as well as being incredibly overpriced (considering you can get a lot of the same merchandise at other stores for cheaper prices). Hot Topic originated in 1988 in Montclair, California with an emphasis on alternative fashion at the time (goth and punk were rather popular in particular at the time) and supporting alternative music at the time (Grunge and Metal in particular) by carrying their music and merchandise. While many goth and punk elitists would often turn their nose up at a store like Hot Topic, for your average small-town kid who didn't exactly have access to boutiques that specialize in this sort of fashion (like Trash & Vaudeville in St. Marks, NYC) absolutely used this store as a necessity to get the clothing and music they liked. Generally marked as 1996 (the year Hot Topic went public and started trading stocks on the NASDAQ), the Nu-Metal era saw a major focus on the \"mall goth\" who wore the controversial phat pants and sold band shirts from the Nu-Metal era, as well as entertainment properties that would be considered popular in those circles (such as Buffy The Vampire Slayer, South Park, and WWF). On top of this, Hot Topic also carried fashion that was inspired by the Goth, Punk, Raver, and Lounge aesthetics that were popular at the time in certain counter-cultural circles. If one really put their mind to it, they could use Hot Topic's fashion and accessories to craft a half-way decent Cyberpunk or Cybergoth look. Many former mall goths would actually consider this era to be Hot Topic's \"golden period\", though how much of that is centered around nostalgia, as opposed to objective truth, is very much open for debate. But as Nu-Metal fell out of fashion, Hot Topic had to make a choice; either stick to the aesthetic groups that made them the raging success that they became or get ready to cycle them out in favor of some new blood and go after the new hot counter-culture movement bubbling up... Around the time Nu-Metal started fading out of fashion (due to most of the fans growing up and outgrowing Nu-Metal because they weren’t wanksty, edgy teenagers anymore), Hot Topic decided to shift its focus away from the aging out Nu-Metal crowd and into the Emo, Punk and Scene crowds that were starting to see a surge in popularity thanks to websites like MySpace and other social media websites that were becoming the new hotness at the time. This is also the time when Hot Topic started majorly expanding into malls throughout The United States and Canada, becoming a rather popular chain (which is also why some people automatically assume that Hot Topic was always this way; that was their first taste of Hot Topic as an entity). In this era, gone were the baggy Phat pants, the bondage pants with the straps, the raver and goth fashions, they were now replaced with many varieties of skinny jeans and tutus that were popular among the scene kids and emo kids at the time (though the piercings and hair dyes that were around during the Nu-Metal era did remain) and albums from the likes of KoRn and Marilyn Manson were now replaced by the likes of My Chemical Romance and Asking Alexandria, and this continued on as the Emo, Punk, and Scene trends continued to ride the wave of popularity, even as MySpace and other older social media platforms started to fade out of fashion in favor of other newer social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and SnapChat. As the sun finally set on the Emo, Punk, and Scene crowds and geek culture started becoming the new cultural norm, Hot Topic, again, shifted away from the old hotness and into the new hotness, though now it's all but completely abandoned selling music-based merch altogether, focusing more on geek culture ephemera like anime, video games, internet memes, K-Pop, and comic books or things targeted at a younger, more mainstream audience like My Little Pony, Disney, Cartoon Network, and Nickelodeon (Hot Topic did sell Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney Merchandise during the Nu-Metal era and MySpace era, but it was nothing compared to how much of it they sell now). However, that isn't to say there aren't still elements of music in the Hot Topic, they're just no longer the focal point of Hot Topic for the first time in its history. Instead, this space is seemingly filled up more with Funko Pops in place of where the music used to be the focal point of. Where Hot Topic goes from here is open for debate, but if they're able to continue with the business plan of catering to the counter-culture, Hot Topic will be around for years to come. The Hot Topic company isn't just limited to Hot Topic proper, but also to Hot Topic's many other business endeavors that still, surprisingly, keep in line with Hot Topic's whole business ethos, such as:",

In the 1930s, gaseous hydrogen was used in zeppelins to make them float; this feeling of slow, retro-futuristic lighter-than-air-ness is what gives the aesthetic its name. Hydrogen was initially inspired by early retrofuturistic media, such as Georges Méliès' \"Le Voyage dans la Lune\" and Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Balloon-Hoax.\" Initially it was fully based on the emotions of certain static images contained within these works, removed from their contexts. Eventually this diversified: first beyond the confines of media into music and digital art, and later on beyond the confines of its initial aesthetic themes, replacing them with more unifying emotional themes.

The aesthetic is named for the the mythological Hyperborean people who lived in the far north, but it also includes amalgamation of various conspiracy theories ranging from Nordic aliens to hollow earth civilizations. It is associated with Esoteric Nazism, a form of neo-Nazism adapting mythological elements. It can also include the glorification of philosophers such as Jonathan Bowden. Hyperborean edits can also be referred to as Schizoposting or Schizowave which derives from the disorders schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, both commonly characterized by paranoid delusions and hallucinations. These disorders unfortunately are heavily stigmatized throughout media, and it is important to note and understand that not all people with schizophrenia are conspiracy theorists, and many find the name and the disorder being tied to this aesthetic offensive and/or harmful. There are some advocating for the lesser used names (which this page uses) to be more widely used as to not associate the disorder with a stigma. Some fans of the aesthetic commonly associate it with pre-Soviet conspiracy theories and attempt to link the disorder to said era as an explanation for the name, although the tie to schizophrenia is not there as the disorder had only been first noted to exist in 1887, 45 years before the start of the Soviet Union, and at that point, it was referred to as Dementia Praecox (essentially translating to childhood dementia). Schizowave visuals are very similar to Fashwave. Videos with this thematic are usually pretty fast, showing different imagery of everything theme-related such as: Hyperborea (and other ancient super-advanced civilizations), gang-stalking, Terry Davis Temple OS, SHROOMS, UFOs, secret doorways into the Earth (hollow Earth theory) on Antarctica maps, Agartha and hollow Earth on old maps, Slavic and Nordic pagan warriors, famous personas from medieval/ancient times, toxic masculinity, biblically accurate angels and sometimes even crossovers with the Trollface meme and Doomerwave. So far, the only public community that talks about this subgenre is Agora Road's Macintosh Cafe. Internet accounts focusing on the Hyperborean aesthetic often use a number of \"dog whistles\" and hate speech catchphrases to identify each other online or attempt to \"spread\" their ideology, often evading chat filters on social media websites such as TikTok and YouTube. Since most of these phrases can be offensive to certain groups of people, reader discretion is advised. Some recognizable dog whistles and words include: The songs used in Hyperborean edits are often called \"Aryan Classics\", named after the Nazi belief of the \"Aryan\" race. It typically includes 1980s Synth-Pop music, or otherwise Scenecore and sped up and remixed versions of Hands Up or Eurodance songs often associated with Nightcore. This practice is often criticized by the fans of those music genres, since they obviously don't want to be associated with Neo-Nazism. Along with that, a lot of songs used in the aesthetic have nothing to do with hate or racism, so the exact reasons why they're used by alt-right groups remains unknown. The most well known song frequently used in this aesthetic is \"gotye - wokeuplikethis\" which is a mashup of Wokeuplikethis by Playboy Carti and Somebody That I Used To Know by Gotye. In 2024, the song L'Amour Toujours by Gigi D'Agostino was banned in various German festivities due to its growing connotations with the alt-right on the internet and was co-opted by anti-immigration groups from Germany. Gigi explained that he was not aware of this happening (since he rarely uses social media), and declared that this song was simply a declaration of love for his wife, his family, music and dance (essentially the polar opposite of hateful ideologies).",

The genre puts an extreme emphasis on cuteness, femininity and intoxication. This is achieved by extreme pitching and warping of both the bass and rhythm, as well as upbeat, bubbly synths. The genre stems mainly from club and nightcore, and consists of high levels of surrealism and confusion. The genre of hyperpop was born out of EDM and traditional pop, and has influences from electroclash and witch house. Other genres of music that are incorporated into hyperpop include dubstep, chiptune and cloud rap. It is also seen as similar to nu-rave. Another heavy influence on the genre is electroclash, which is a very similar genre which died out in the 2000s. In 2019, Spotify listed an official hyperpop playlist, which further publicised the genre. This playlist consisted of 100 gecs, Slayyyter, Gupi, Caroline Polachek, Hannah Diamond, and Kim Petras. The genre gained additional popularity on TikTok during the early 2020s, with a notable example including the song 'SugarCrash!'.[1][2] For most Hyperpop art the layout is extremely crowded (an exception would be 100gecs' 1000gecs album). It is a combination of diverse art styles, so we will be sticking with some of the common themes. Hyperpop is mainly charactized by themes of embracing the aesthetics of advertising, consumerism, and corporate branding. Most of the images, especially cover art from songs produced and sung by individuals who are women have heavy inspiration from other aesthetics such as McBling/Baddie, Y2K Futurism, and Slimepunk to a lesser extent. Its artists often present devised personas inspired by cyberculture. Hyperpop fashion is akin to Y2K Futurism and McBling/Baddie, with wilder elements such as vibrant makeup with sparkles, extremely long lashes and glittery, shiny and/or glossy clothing. Long or well-kept hair is seen as a key element to expressing yourself. Dyed hair is also common, as well as long acrylic nails. Bright colors are also key. PC Music is a British record label founded in June 2013 by producer A. G. Cook. The label is known for its surreal or exaggerated take on pop music, creating more of an experimental and electronic pop sound. The label has inspired both praise and criticism from journalists, and has been called \"polarizing\". Scenecore is a subgenre of Hyperpop music that draws inspiration from the Scene subculture and Nightcore. Scenecore became popular in social media in the early 2020s as a modern take and revival of Scene culture, which is a period known as the \"Rawring Twenties\", referring to the Scene slang term of rawr. Fashion styles like 2020 Alt are the most prominent inside the Scenecore community, and the visuals often incorporate elements of Glitchcore, Mind Murder and Animecore. Scenecore songs are usually pitched up and use \"nostalgic\" melodies, along with samples relating to popular video games and anime shows. Scenecore could also be considered remarkably edgier than typical Scene songs, because in fact a lot of songs focus on things like gore, drugs and the unknown. However, Scenecore is a relatively new phenomenon and its style and influence is still evolving. For example, in mid-2023, many Scenecore musical artists started sampling old Pop and Eurodance songs from the 2000s. Other musical genres that are adjacent to this subgenre are Krushclub and Sigilkore, sometimes getting mixed up with Scenecore. Some notable Scenecore musical artists include: External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

It shares elements with Cleancore, as the colours are similar (Icepunk being less bright and more misty) and frozen places typically have a smooth and sanitized feel to them. Icepunk is essentially the antithesis of seapunk and seems to have a bit of a rivalry with the microgenre. It's been described as \"Seapunk in an ice age\". It's said the term originated with rapper Drrty Pharms in an interview with Mishka: In many ways, Icepunk music is very similar to seapunk in terms of content, but the music evokes more of a wintery vibe, like you're stranded in the middle of a blizzard and you're drunk and high as hell, and it tends to have more of an early-to-mid 90's R&B vibe compared to the more house influences of seapunk.  Artists within the genre include: Much like its contemporary, Seapunk, Icepunk takes a lot of inspiration from 90's raver fashion but implements shiny and holographic clothing as well as more wintery clothing to evoke that icy, cold aesthetic that is so closely associated with Icepunk, so there is definitely a lot of the Holosexual aesthetic that crosses over into Icepunk. Icepunk art evokes a cold, wintery vibe, utilizing lots of blues, cyans, purples, whites, and other monochromatic colors, but other than that shares a lot in common with seapunk.",

Despite being nearly limitless in its potential expression due to the nature of human imagination, Imaginarium tends to lean towards a somewhat abstract, highly colorful theme. The aesthetic combines many different elements, making it more visually interesting and especially appealing to younger demographics. Though not inherently childish or aimed at children, Imaginarium does take on many childlike qualities, such as the use of playroom-type environments, vibrant colors and well-known fantastical motifs. Often illustrated as a dream-like world that exists parallel to our own or simply as a creative addition to everyday life, this aesthetic is mainly based on alternative interpretation and recombination of existing themes in a playful, lighthearted way, similar to that of a pleasant surreal dream. Imaginarium has no ties to any particular medium, setting or form of expression while still being largely reliant on familiar, recognizable concepts, separating it from similar aesthetics such as Craftcore, Kidcore or Psychedelica. Imaginarium is versatile, and thus allows for exploration of somewhat darker and creepier themes within its realm while still maintaining an intriguing, creative atmosphere. Examples of this can be seen with one of (PSVita) Little Big Planet's in-game locations called the \"Spooky Mansion\". Note that while this aesthetic can be used in interpretation of psychedelic experiences, it is primarily meant to represent the creative wanderings of a sober mind. Imaginarium's visual contents can be nearly limitless in the right context, making the creation of a definitive list practically impossible. However, some of the most common/generally recognized visuals include: Themes, in this case, represent a general set of core ideas, the \"mechanism\" through which Imaginarium manifests itself in media. \nThese mainly include: As with visuals, Imaginarium's fashion relies mainly on way of presentation rather than a strict set of items. Anything can fall under this definition, given use of the correct themes and imagery. \nHowever, some general examples include: Imaginarium music tends to mostly rely on melody rather than words to convey the right atmosphere, thus a lot of songs of this aesthetic lack lyrical content.\nGood examples of this are: External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

These three city-states ruled that area in and around the Valley of Mexico from 1428 until the combined forces of the Spanish conquistadores and their native allies who ruled under Hernán Cortés defeated them in 1521. The alliance was formed from the victorious factions of a civil war fought between the city of Azcapotzalco and its former tributary provinces. Despite the initial conception of the empire as an alliance of three self-governed city-states, the capital Tenochtitlan became dominant militarily. By the time the Spanish arrived in 1519, the lands of the alliance were effectively ruled from Tenochtitlan, while other partners of the alliance had taken subsidiary roles. The alliance waged wars of conquest and expanded after its formation. The alliance controlled most of central Mexico at its height, as well as some more distant territories within Mesoamerica, such as the Xoconochco province, an Aztec exclave near the present-day Guatemalan border. Aztec rule has been described by scholars as \"hegemonic\" or \"indirect\". The Aztecs left rulers of conquered cities in power so long as they agreed to pay semi-annual tribute to the alliance, as well as supply military forces when needed for the Aztec war efforts. In return, the imperial authority offered protection and political stability and facilitated an integrated economic network of diverse lands and peoples who had significant local autonomy. Aztec religion was a monistic pantheism in which the Nahua concept of teotl was construed as the supreme god Ometeotl, as well as a diverse pantheon of lesser gods and manifestations of nature. The popular religion tended to embrace the mythological and polytheistic aspects, and the empire's state religion sponsored both the monism of the upper classes and the popular heterodoxies. The empire even officially recognized the largest cults such that the deity was represented in the central temple precinct of the capital Tenochtitlan. The imperial cult was specifically that of the distinctive warlike patron god of the Mexica Huitzilopochtli. Peoples were allowed to retain and freely continue their own religious traditions in conquered provinces so long as they added the imperial god Huitzilopochtli to their local pantheons.",

It was pioneered by Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and many others. Impressionist art was an impression of a painting; Impressionist works were first seen as unfinished paintings and significantly criticized because of this. This art movement is also characterized by use of light, as well as landscapes appearing as the main image (instead of as the background of an image). Artists also tended to go outside to paint or see their subjects, instead of keeping in their studios. While Impressionism did not explicitly begin until the 1870s, it has its roots in works and artists prior to this time. Henri Fantin-Latour’s realist works occasionally reflected the experimental styles that characterized Impressionism. Johan Jongkind’s and Eugène Boudin’s interest in the portrayal and impact of light were similarly important. Edouard Manet also frequented Impressionist circles; both his techniques and subject matter influenced Impressionism. Manet is sometimes seen as the transition from Realism to Impressionism. The first Impressionist exhibition was held in Paris in 1874, and featured Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, and Berthe Morisot, amongst many others. [1] It was “greeted with taunts, skepticism . . . the word Impressionism was used by a hostile critic as a derisive term”[2] One of the most important parts of Impressionism was the portrayal of light. This led to the “dabbed” brushwork that is so prominent, as it allowed artists to better portray light in their paintings. The brushwork also made the paintings appear unfinished, as if they were an “impression” of a painting. Color also played an important role. Prior to Impressionism, painters frequently applied a varnish that toned down the colors of their works. Impressionist artists rejected this idea. Furthermore, developments in synthetic pigments allowed artists to use new, brighter colors that contrasted previous art styles.[3]",

The indie aesthetic includes a variety of independent music genres, including shoegaze. This can also include the indie movie genre, as many movies in the genre add to the original indie aesthetic. The version of the indie aesthetic from the 2000s to 2012 is now named Indie Sleaze. The later iteration of the indie aesthetic in 2019-2020 is labeled Indie Kid. Other variations are usually unlabeled and just generically called indie. The indie aesthetic originated in the 1980s in the United Kingdom. Sometimes referred to as “Twee”, indie fashion mainly consisted of striped t-shirts, jeans, mop tops and anoraks. Musically, indie consisted primarily of jangling guitar bands, typified by the C86 compilation, which marked a pivotal moment in the codification of indie as a distinct music genre and aesthetic sensibility. Indie music became known as \"indiepop\" and fans were referred to as \"cuties\", \"anoraks\", or \"indie kids\". In music as in fashion, indie was a rejection of 80s mainstream culture and was heavily inspired by the 1960s. In the late 80s the \"Baggy\" aesthetic emerged, centered around Manchester (or \"Madchester\"), marking an aesthetic shift in indie toward brighter, baggier clothing. Occurring in the context of the UK's Second Summer of Love and the rise of acid house, \"indie dance\" combined 60s psychedelia with modern dance music. After peaking around 1990, indie returned to a more muted color palette and musical flavor with the rise of Shoegaze and Grunge in the early 90s. In the mid-90s, indie music peaked commercially with Britpop, a movement whose aesthetic and musical brashness contrasted sharply with indie's \"Twee\" image during the 80s (continued in the 90s by indiepop labels such as Sarah Records, and into the 21st century by groups such as Belle and Sebastian). 20th-century Indie has experienced several revivals or reinterpretations, including 2010s Twee fashion, 2000s and early 2010s Indie Sleaze, Art Hoe and the Indie Kid aesthetic of today. The Indie aesthetic was, in many ways, similar to the Pastel aesthetic, however, the color is paler and even less intense.  Another key difference between the two is while the Pastel aesthetic conveys a sense of innocence and sweetness, the Indie aesthetic conveys more of a darker, moodier tone. Photos in this aesthetic often have sad text overlaid to further communicate the mood. Indie blogs also often feature photos of ornate architectural spaces, snow-covered landscapes, and bruised skin. Photos may be low quality and grainy for the vintage look. Old school Indie fashion was pretty vague and unassuming. Many pieces were thrifted and casual, a bit more digestible and easier to assemble than Grunge although very similar. It does take some influence from Normcore due to how wide the spectrum of the fashion is however old school indie fashion had more characteristics that made it look less basic, the common theme is individuality so personal preference is the biggest value present. Some other common factors include darker colors and alternative tendencies. Independently released music is not directly financially dependent on any of the four major labels (WMG, Sony BMG, EMI, and Universal).  Specifically, Indie rock, a genre of rock music that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1970s, is very popular in indie circles. Originally used to describe independent record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock.

It rose to fame in 2020 through the app TikTok. This resurgence differs from the original Indie style which did not include such bright colors and was considered more \"alternative\" by today's standards. Indie Kid was also influenced by Kidcore, Cuddle Party, and Skater. In the indie kid aesthetic, there is a specific way that videos and photos are edited. There are plenty of indie kid filters to choose from, but they all have some things in common. It's heavy on saturation and vibrance, and contrast is lowered. Grain is sometimes added as well. These videos and photos are most commonly edited on the Camera app on an iPhone. There are many filters on most popular apps to give photos the heavily saturated visuals. Imagery for the indie kid aesthetic revolve around things ranging from nature and cartoonish 60s-esque graphics to urban imagery like skateparks and convenience stores. Much of the visual components of indie kid center around action shots like skateboarding, nature walks, and goofing around with friends. Visuals also encompass room design and fashion choices where the textures, patterns, clothing styles, and colors make up a majority of the aesthetic's recognizable features. Indie kid fashion is very similar to the fashion trends of the 2000s and sometimes older. For girls, a crop top and baggy pants is popular, with the top being some type of bold color and the pants being jeans or even cargo pants. An oversized tee, an oversized sweatshirt or a collared shirt under a sweatshirt are also options, but the baggy pants are a key feature of this aesthetic. Boys follow most of the same rules, minus the crop tops (but they are of course free to wear it if they wish). Common shoes worn by indie kids are Converse, Vans, Doc Martens, and other sneakers/platforms. Makeup is natural, but sometimes heavy blush is worn, too. Hair is typically worn down or in two ponytails. Bangs, especially curtain bangs, are popular. Brands where you can find many of these things are Princess Polly, SheIn, Brandy Melville, Francesca's, American Eagle, Vans and various thrift stores. Indie kids often live their lives as if they're in an A24 coming-of-age movie, highlighting skating with friends, getting food from gas stations, blasting music, and filming all the while. Restaurants such as In-N-Out Burger and 7-Eleven are popular places for indie kids to go and eat food, due to their overall embodiment of the aesthetic. This is a very free spirted, innocent lifestyle filled with camaraderie and memory making. Indie kid culture has also grown to center around music as well, which has been essential to the growth of the original vintage indie aesthetic.

This popularity is often attributed to people adopting the style for its optimism during the Great Recession.

In 2021, the aesthetic was popularized online and gained the name \"indie sleaze\".[1] The indie band Metric and its singer-songwriter Emily Haines remained active from the 1990s to present.

The aesthetic gained momentum as artists experimented with adding playful text or doodles to their images, creating a distinctive visual language that combines the rawness of amateur photography with a touch of whimsy. Visually, Isocore compositions are characterized by intentionally low-resolution bug photos, showcasing the details often overlooked in high-quality imagery.

It emphasised speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. This aesthetic helped influence Art Deco, Dadaist, and surreal art. Often is abstract and surreal design depicting industrial or wartime scenes like airplanes, factories, cities, cars, artillery, war casualities etc. They often use vibrant psychadelic like colors and has emphasis on sharp curves that form mosaic shapes. Futurist fashion (also known as \"fashion forward\") involves wearing \nthings that will soon become very fashionable. It usually strays away \nfrom normal trends in order to create a new one (i.e. avant-garde). Music often uses unconventional instruments that sound like machines such as noise intoners and often simulates industrial machinery especially cars and airplanes. Futurist plays were often unorthodox and often malicious towards the audience like putting glue on seats. Futurist figures often espoused the philosophies as with their art with many of them being pro-war, technological acceleration, and increased industrialization. Futurists were also against marriage, academics, and Christianity. Futurist politics also sadly interlaps with Fascism with one of the most influencial figures, Marinetti having co-written the Fascist manifesto and absorbed the Futurist party into the Fascist party. Although in the late '30s many Fascists considered Futurist art to be \"degenerate\" and started destroying it. Aeropittura was the successor of Italian Futurism, being carried out by the second generation of Futurist artists, after World War I. Its style principally focuses on airplanes and concepts like dynamism, speed and movement. A version of Futurism from Russia that alligned more closely with cubist principles.

The word 'mafia' in Italian loosely translates to \"swagger\" or \"boldness\". Also called the Sicilian Mafia, or just the Mafia, the Italian Mafia was famous for its high class fashion and lifestyle, often indulging in expensive homes and imported goods. This aspect of the criminal organization has been idolized and fetishized over time by everyday people. The Mafia was most notably and infamously known for its use of violence and organized crime to obtain money and notoriety. They have also been known for heavy drug and alcohol use, often partaking in drug trafficking. Crime cases that involved Mafia members were of high popularity at the time of occurrence, making the members and bosses notable historical figures. Other Mafia families have popped up in places across the world, including the USA. Current day adoption of the Italian Mafia aesthetic focuses on the expensive look and risk of danger. This topic is written into many fictional novels and fanfictions where authors and readers may use it as an escape into a more exciting life. A common name/term for the subject is \"mafia princess\" in which the main character is swooped away into or is involved in the Mafia and treated like royalty. Care should be taken when portraying this aesthetic to prevent supporting or romanticizing the Italian Mafia, as it was a dangerous criminal organization associated with terrorism and drugs, and it was used to stereotype Italian immigrants as being criminals.[1] Similar fashion inspiration can be taken from the Boujee aesthetic as a replacement. Fashion for the Italian Mafia aesthetic, as written in fiction and popularized online, has been highly focused on both the glitz and glam of living the high life and the slicked, preparedness for getting into trouble. There is a distinct crossover with Boujee fashion as well as Femme Fatale, Playboy, and Scrapper.

This aesthetic can also be applied to other vehicles, aircraft, computer cases and even bags. The Itasha decoration usually consists of stickers, drawings and Japanese text over cars. This aesthetic surged in the 2000s. In Japan, Itasha cars are usually found in the Japanese districts of Akihabara (Tokyo), Nipponbashi (Osaka) and Ōsu (Nagoya). In the 80s, imported luxury cars were widely demanded in Tokyo. The term \"Itasha\" in Japanese was first used as a slang for luxury cars imported from Italy (Ita, from Italian + Sha, meaning car), which were very appreciated in Japan back then. \nLater the meaning of the word \"Itasha\" evolved to mean \"Cringeworthy car\" or \"Painful car\", mixing the words \"Itai\" (Painful/cringe) and \"Sha\" (Car), referring to how expensive they were - \"painful to the wallet\". The Itasha car subculture began to rise in the 1980s but it wasn't very revelant until the 2000s, when Anime became more internationalized. Back in the 1980s, Itasha cars were mainly decorated with stickers and plushies. \nIn 2007, the first Itasha-themed convention, Autosalone, was held in Ariake, Tokyo, making the Itasha subculture more popular. \nIn 2008, the Japanese company Aoshima Bunka Kyozai started producing Itasha cars, and since then more companies started producing their own too.

Its meteoric rise and nightmarish fall coincide with the smash hit MTV reality TV show Jersey Shore. Fortunately, for the vast majority of people, the Jersey Shore aesthetic has retreated back to the New York/New Jersey area since when Jersey Shore announced it was ending, most people were quite happy with this news, and the Jersey Shore reunion has not inspired any sort of revival.  It was always associated with working-class urban Italian-Americans with a tendency to try and be as macho as possible.  While the term itself dates back to the 1970s to 1980s (where that era Jersey Shore aesthetic may actually play a role in some of the aesthetics involved in Synthwave), the modern Jersey Shore that is often associated with the Jersey Shore tag didn't come into style until the mid-to-late 2000s; starting off as an internet meme before MTV decided to unleash it onto the world with Jersey Shore. The Jersey Shore visual aesthetic typically depicts lots of beaches (from New Jersey), shore houses, night clubs, and people tanned up and ready to go.  There's also a lot of Italian flags used in Jersey Shore visual aesthetics, due to the high percentage of individuals either of Italian descent or claiming Italian descent (despite not having an ounce of Italian ancestry).  Despite this little quirk in the aesthetic, there are very few actual full-blooded Italians who are affiliated with the Jersey Shore aesthetic. Jersey Shore fashion is typical of what you'd see on MTV's Jersey Shore: lots of Ed Hardy and Affliction, rosaries (hilarious given how debaucherous and Hedonistic they can be), bling often associated with the high roller lifestyle, and expensive Italian brands.  The Jersey Shore aesthetic is largely centered around \"fake it 'til you make it\" and the Jersey Shore woman's fashion could cross over into Baddie territory (and could be seen as the launching point for the Baddie fashion style as a whole) but also shares with the general rule of thumb for their male counterparts.  You can also expect a lot of skintight t-shirts and tanktops adorned with the Italian flag in a show of Italian pride (although, ironically, most individuals who adhere to the Jersey Shore aesthetic aren't even full-blooded or even remotely Italian; it doesn't matter how much you fake it, that is one goal that you will never make because you cannot change your ethnicity). One of the most noteworthy (and constantly meme'd) hairstyles of the Jersey Shore aesthetic is the \"blow-out\" (famously worn by DJ Pauly D of Jersey Shore fame) where they spend hours combing and gelling their hair until it looks like something out of an anime (Dragon Ball Z is a popular comparison).  Otherwise, the hairstyles tend to be buzzed and styled in a very short way.  Jersey Shore women have a tendency to really cake on the make-up and wear hair extensions, although another popular hairstyle among the Women is the \"poof\" (popularized by Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi) where they style their hair in a way that could give the illusion of being taller than they really are.  One thing the people on the Jersey Shore loooooooove to do is tan.  They will burn their skin to a crisp or use bucketloads of fake tanner to give the appearance of constantly being out and about on the go, despite the fact they usually spend their time indoors either tanning, working out, styling their hair, caking on make-up, going to the laundromat to have their clothes dropped of for the next day, or going out to the clubs to pick up women.  As mentioned previously, there are a lot of Jersey Shore people who spend a lot of time in the gym and, as a result, anabolic steroid and HGH usage is very popular among the men to enhance their muscular appearance. Interestingly, the Jersey Shore aesthetic even has its own seeming language with terminology that one would have to have at least a 5-hour dissertation to begin to understand... but I'll do my best to break it down for you so you can keep that time for more productive things. The most popular style of music within the Jersey Shore aesthetic is, undoubtedly, House music or any sort of music you'd hear blasting at a night club late into the night. Other famous local musicians from the Jersey Shore area include Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi. Under Construction",

        "description": "Jirai Kei\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther names\nPien Kei\n\n\nDecade of origin\n2020\n\n\nKey colours\nMuted pink, black, grey\n\n\nRelated aesthetics\nAnimecoreCutecoreDenpa KeiDrugcoreE-GirlGirly KeiKawaiiKuromicoreLarme KeiMelodycorePEEPSSanriocoreVampireYami KawaiiYandere Jirai Kei (地雷系), translating to \"landmine type\", is a subculture and aesthetic originating from Japan that is heavily based on the teens hanging out in the night life of Kabukicho. During the height of its popularity it highly resembled Japanese Girly fashion, the edgier variants of it in particular, but has since moved on to integrate a broader variety of styles. The stereotype behind this subculture is that cute, hyper-feminine young women who dress in darker fashion styles have personalities that do not match their appearance. Rather than being sweet and demure, they are said to be violent and obsessive (like a Yandere), self-harm, and drink or smoke heavily. Many brands in Japan have quickly catered to this trend, with Western brands in-tune with Kawaii culture following suit. Jirai Kei is derived from Jirai Onna (地雷女, lit. \"landmine woman\"): a derogatory term that is used to label and stereotype a woman as what would be considered a \"ticking time bomb\" in English, especially towards mentally ill women with BPD, bipolar disorder, and other mood swing-causing illnesses. It is commonly used to dismiss women, often ex-girlfriends, as crazy and/or dangerous over arbitrary traits, such as a fondness for Kawaii. Women within the subculture are called \"Jirai Joshi\" (地雷女子), or landmine girls, while men in the subculture are referred to as \"Jirai Danshi\" (地雷男子), or landmine boys. It became associated with various darker fashion styles due to a \"psycho girlfriend\" dress-up challenge that went viral during the March 2020 corona restrictions in Japan.[1] Said dress-up challenge highly referenced traits commonly associated with the Toyoko Kids - a criminal gang mainly consisting out of young runaway teens, some of which were groomed online by older men into believing that they will find a better life in the red light district that is Kabukicho. They are often exploited for sex work, drug trade and other criminal activity.[2][3] Although the western followers of Jirai Kei as solely a fashion trend try to separate it from its dark roots, the subculture still has a mostly negative public image within Japan. The associations with the psycho girlfriend trope are interpreted as a misogynistic stereotype, while Japanese girls who identify as \"landmine\" fully embrace it.[4] This misunderstanding comes from the fact that the language barrier prevents an accurate interpretation of Japanese articles and social media posts about the subculture, the lack of awareness of how mental health issues are perceived in Japan, and brands focus on using the term Jirai Kei solely as a sales point in an attempt to capitalize on the subculture's popularity regardless of the advertised products being actually associated with it. Girls in this subculture add heavy filters and edits to their photos. Pale pink and white filters can add a slight haze to all of their images, and they are often decorated in virtual stickers with Jirai Kei motifs. They also use face and body editing to the point of an unnatural appearance. Impossibly large eyes with anime proportions, making skin more pale, and making their bodies thinner and longer are extremely common in photos. This is with the goal of appearing eerie and puppy-eyed, diverging from the trend of \"pien\" makeup on Japanese tiktok. The color palettes of Jirai Kei is mainly white, black and pastel pink, though on occasion red, blue and grey is also used. To contrast all of the sweet and girly visuals, violent imagery is often shown. Box-cutters, razors, and pockets knives are commonly featured in outfit posts. The stereotype is that a landmine girl would use it to threaten her boyfriend if he upsets her, or that she engages in self-harm. Additionally, these cute girls often pose with fake guns (firearms are illegal in Japan), cigarettes, or alcohol and energy drinks (from Strong Zero and Monster Energy) with straws, presumably to protect their lipstick while drinking. Many photos have color-scheme matching energy drink cans, and it is even popular to stack and glue the cans in the shape of machine guns. Similar to Yami Kawaii, there is often medical imagery of pills and syringes, usually paired with narcotics and synthetic drugs. Sanrio is strongly associated with the kawaii, girly, and consumerist culture in Japan. As a result, girls into Jirai Kei are also associated with these characters, specifically Kuromi and My Melody. People in this subculture own and take photos of plushies of these characters and own an assortment of merchandise, such as backpacks, pencil pouches, etc. themed around these characters. Sanrio has taken notice and even released Jirai Kei-inspired plushies of Kuromi and My Melody. Another character that can be associated is Menhera-chan, the suicidal magical girl that popularized Yami Kawaii. Her artist has drawn her in stereotypical outfits, and her self-destructive habits could be relatable for those in the subculture. There's also many artists engaging with the subculture who draw anime-style illustrations of landmine girls wearing the typical outfits while in stereotypical situations, such as taking selfies, holding a can while squatting on the streets, or having a mental breakdown. Jirai Kei followers often repost these drawings on social media. The styles associated with Jirai Kei are constantly changing with the core defining trait being that the fashion is worn by landmine girls. Comparable to E-Girl's style, while landmine girls may wear many different fashion styles, there is a main look typically associated with the aesthetic that evolved out of a mix of several different alternative genres. The initial look associated with the Jirai Kei subculture derived from Japanese Girly fashion and Yami Kawaii, however outfits consisting out of Goth Punk, Jersey Maid, and darker general alternative fashion have also been popular among its followers. As the trends within Jirai Kei keep on changing, many brands mimic one another and release mix-and-match variations for the various styles worn. The fabric of the clothes tends to be on the more synthetic side, with the quality not being that high, on account of them often being made by fast fashion companies who constantly adopt to the latest trends. Regardless of the style worn, the idea is to appear cute yet mature, but with an dark aura. The most common tops are blouses with ultra-feminine details that may slightly resemble Lolita Fashion. Peter Pan collars, ruffles, lace trim, puffed sleeves, cold-shoulders, contrasting buttons are some tropes that are featured in the blouses. Alternative outfits use coat-dresses instead, and winter outfits utilize knit sweaters. Girls also often tie ribbons or add bow brooches with rhinestone or pearl-accented faux jewels at the neck. Some brands have also released oversized tees and sweatshirts that can fit in with this aesthetic. They often have a print with a stereotypical motif, English text, anime prints, etc. These also contain feminine details, but less often. For example, there may be eyelets for lacing ribbon through, zippers, or detachable Peter Pan collars. This resembles the fashion of the Yami Kawaii aesthetic, and contributes to an edgier and less girly look. Jirai boys add masculine or androgynous elements to this style, while girls like to pair these tops with chunky sneakers and necklaces. High waisted mini skirts are by far the most popular bottom. The silhouette can be flared, trapezoid or pleated. Silver hardware details such as heart-shaped belt buckles, eyelets, and zippers add edge to the outfit and contrast the lace and girly details of the blouse. But there are also ruffles, ribbon lacing to resemble a corset, and ruffled suspenders to add girliness. Shorts can also be featured in this aesthetic, as well as longer flowy skirts. However, they are both comparatively rare to the mini skirts. Usually the bottoms are black while the top is pink or white, though sometimes this is flipped. The more casual Jersey Maid and Yami Kawaii inspired looks can also have track pants like ones from Adidas as a pairing with a track suit jacket or oversized tee or sweatshirt. Because the legs are most often exposed in this style, lace or fishnet stockings are worn, and could be switched or even doubled up with ruffled or lace ankle socks. The shoes are most commonly platform loafers or multi-strapped mary janes, and most girls buy their shoes from BUBBLES Tokyo, DearMyLove, Liz Lisa and others. The shoes can be more decorated, with faux jewels, ribbon laces, rhinestone buckles and silver cross charms. The most popular bags are totes and mini backpacks. Usually, they're pink or black, sometimes adorned with ribbons and bows with plushies or Sanrio figurine keychains attached. The most popular mini backpacks on social media are the studded MCM mini packpack and Melody Maison de Fleur totes. Other girls may instead use bags from popular luxury brands. Aside from ribbons and bows, there is not much jewelry involved in Jirai Kei. Most styles include only earrings or neckwear like chokers, piercings and necklaces. A popular trend is the Viviene Westwood orb necklace. Because of the color scheme, many girls avoid gold jewelry and opt for silver. Hime-cut bangs, which are straight bangs across the forehead with side bangs around chin-length, are extremely popular amongst young women in Japan in general as it is an easy way to archive the illusion of a small face. It fits in with the ultra-feminine style. Because these women are Japanese and around high school age, the most common hair color is black, since dyed hair is not allowed in schools. However, some girls add highlights that can be bleached blonde or in different shades of pink. In terms of styling, pigtails (also called twin tails), are the majority hairstyle. They can be either low or high, with high pigtails often being half-up half-down. Girls often curl the ends and decorate these twin tails with ribbons and bows, often with the same faux jewels on their brooches. Other hair accessories such as rectangle headdresses, headbands with faux jewels, and bobby pins with charms are popular too. For the eye makeup, the most popular is an exaggerated version of  the \"namida bukuro\" makeup style where the tear bags are emphasized to look puffy as if the wearer is about to cry, which is further highlighted with pink undereye blush. The additional effect of appearing sickly is also desired. The eyeliner is downturned to give a more \"puppy-like\" , feminine and sad appearance. Face and lip makeup are equally pink, with blush and sparkly highlighter being high on the cheekbones. Lip makeup has a wide variation, with some looks being more matte, some glossy, some sculpted, some even. Many additional cosmetic products are also used for exaggerated features. Fake lashes are generally popular in Japan, and in Jirai Kei, they are longer and spikier. Dark circle lenses are also popular, and serve to make the eyes look bigger and anime-like. Long acrylic nails are also popular and often feature lace patterns, faux jewels, corset lacing, crosses, as well as stereotypical motifs like the pleading face emoji. Due to the roots of the term, Jirai Kei is highly associated with dark and disturbing themes that are also very prevalent within the subculture. There are strong associations with mental illness, self harm, drug usage, sex work, underage prostitution, and other uncomfortable subjects. The negative aspects of the \"landmine\" stereotype are often emulated and romanticized as a quirky gimmick solely for aesthetic reasons.[5] On Twitter in particular, it's not uncommon for followers of the subculture to constantly promote self-destructive behaviour, the accounts often being part of shtwt (pro-self-harm) and edtwt (pro-eating disorder).[4] There's also a strong association with \"bangya\" culture with landmine girls also being stereotyped as groupies who are obsessive over their favorite bands and music artists to an unhealthy degree. Another problem is the fetishization of the \"landmine\" stereotype, which is a glimpse into the wider topic of sexualizing women who exhibit mental illness. It is problematic for its ableist rhetoric claiming mentally-ill women to be \"freaky\", \"hot but crazy\" and more desirable sexually and emotionally, as well as its infantalistic undertone of these women being more emotionally attached and dependent on their lover's affection.[6] This fetishization of mentally ill women and use of the femme-fatale archetype ignores the unpleasant nuances of suffering from BPD or bipolar disorder and targets women who are mentally vulnerable to emotionally abusive, power-imbalanced relationships.[7] There also have been issues caused by the strong associations with the host culture of Kabukicho. As people of any age can enter those establishments as long as no alcohol is served, male hosts have been actively going for young girls to spend money on them in exchange for affection, often resulting in the girls resorting to \"papa katsu\" (sugar-daddying) in order to afford their host club addiction.[8] Because the clothes worn are often very brand specific, some Jirai Kei netizens suggest that there is slight elitism in the community for purchasing items from the \"correct\" stores, regardless of if the price can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for western followers that endure high shipping fees from Japanese brand proxies. On social media, especially on TikTok, some argue that this brand-focused side of Jirai Kei encourages hyper consumerism and trend-cycling while the same is also said for those who buy cheap replica items from problematic fast fashion stores like Shein/Romwe. As the subculture can't be separated from its problematic parts precisely because they are what make Jirai Kei what it is, many have argued that its name shouldn't be used in a throwaway manner in reference to styles or trends in order to not expose strangers to potential triggering content.

        "description": "Jungle Grunge\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated aesthetics\nDark NaturalismGloomcoreJunglecoreNaturecore Jungle Grunge is an aesthetic originating largely from the 1980s and continuing on consistently into the late 2000s, though music relating to the aesthetic mostly began during the mid-1990s and continues until this day. Jungle Grunge, as the name suggests, is a combination of the grime and darkness of Grunge and visuals of jungles, overgrown forests, abandoned houses, indigenous temples, caves, encyclopedias/science books and abandoned laboratories in remote tropical areas. The aesthetic is represented both by movies and music, with the usual themes of how harsh, mysterious and unhospitable jungles can be. Accompanying tropes are the use of tribal elements, whether it be Mayan-esque pyramids and masked natives in media or exotic percussion, string and woodwind instruments in music. Additionally, there might be mentions and/or the inclusion of dinosaurs and paleontological themes. A small amount of animations and games also partake in an aesthetic similar to Jungle Grunge. The visuals of Jungle Grunge aim to present how unwelcoming and dangerous these tropical areas can be, but also how morbidly fascinating they are to people who come to analyze and venture into them. There's a brooding theme of how nature wins over us no matter how much we try to overcome it, with all of the abandoned architecture and vehicles. In a lot of Jungle Grunge movies, there is the trope of a laboratory or other such large corporate estalbishment attempting to alter or exploit the jungle, but being subsequently taken over, whether it be by the indigenous peoples in act of rebellion, the animals, or some mystical force or creature. On the lighter side of things, Jungle Grunge visuals may feature a fascination with the more academic aspects of the aesthetic, featuring illustrations of journals and encyclopedias describing newly discovered phenomena and organisms. Generally however, most representatives of the aesthetics focus on the harsher elements. The main aspect that differentiates the two aesthetics are the message and values. While Junglecore may be serene, on occasion positive, lighter and adventurous, Jungle Grunge is much more brash, aggressive, negative, animalistic and dark. To put it this way, Junglecore welcomes visitors into the jungle and encourages them to explore its natural wonders, and Jungle Grunge wants to traumatize and defeat those who enter, all the while filling them with morbid curiosity. The two consistent similarities are, of course, the focus on jungles and rainforests, and overlapping in media that represents the aesthetics.",

While similar fashion trends are still around, the term is no longer used due to the base association with violent gangs around the height of its popularity, and \"Mode fashion\" (モードファッション) is used instead. Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto presented their works at the Paris Collection in the spring and summer of 1982, giving the fashion world a “black impact”. It was evaluated by current Chanel and Fendi designers Karl Lagerfeld, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Donna Karan, and gradually passed on to the media, entertainers, artists, and the cutting-edge people of the era. In addition, DC brands such as \"Comsade Mode\" and \"Scoop\", which were popular at that time, also promoted black fashion. Not only Harajuku and Shibuya, but also the adult town of Ginza was crowded with Karasu Zoku. They enter the festival wearing black costumes instead of the traditional haneto costumes, leading to the nickname \"crow gang\" or simply, \"crows.\" They're also known as \"crow haneto,\" but their appearance and actions are not fitting of the name haneto, and the regional media does not include the word in their descriptions. They are classified as a type of foot-borne bōsōzoku. The karasu-zoku first appeared at the festival in 1986. Initially, they were not viewed as a serious problem, but they became more dangerous when bōsōzoku members began joining. The Japanese started raising awareness about this issue, but it only made Karasu Zoku more popular. Aomori City quickly took steps to ensure the safety of their festival, as it was a well known tourist attraction. In 1996, the organizers forcefully grouped the karasu-zoku together into a single area in order to monitor their actions more effectively. However, this only led to an increased level of hysteria among the gang members and was not an effective method of containing their behavior. The number of Crow Gang increased to over 10,000 by 2000, and their actions escalated to violence against different gang members or even against tourists and the police force, which destroyed the festival cheer and decreased public safety. In 2001, the organizers introduced a system where all of the floats would begin and end their procession at the same time. The same year, the prefecture enacted a law that allowed the police force to act against the vandals before the violence began. As a result, the festivities became more contained, but the number of crow gang members decreased drastically. Karasu Zoku consists of covering the whole body in only black. It was also popular to wear it in a heavy layered style by combining long lengths and tattered details. The name comes from the appearance of a group of black crows. The style is androgynous, asymmetrical, and utterly unpredictable in shape Not only black-based designer brands, but also DC brands, which are casual and easy to wear trends, were also popular.

It is said they will often out-rule the fact that one of their offspring said or did something inappropriate, just because it is her \"precious angel\". The most recognizable trait of a Karen (other than their entitled attitude) is their haircut. The most common haircut among the Karen community is the infamous a-symmetrical bob, usually swept to the left side of their face left natural or with harshly dyed blonde highlights (often described as a \"reverse mullet\"). The hairstyle is known for looking like something you'd find in either Emo or Scene, but with more blonde highlights that just screams \"I demand to speak with your manager\". The Karen fashion used in parodies and aesthetics tends to be very tacky, low-quality, and overpriced and is strictly worn for the sake of selling whatever pyramid scheme they may or may not have gotten wrapped up in, especially if they're involved in a make-up based MLM (Mary Kay, Avon, Younique), or a clothing/accessories based MLM (LuLaRoe, Paparazzi). A meme online is that Karens bathe themselves in essential oils in place of things like deodorant, soap-and-water, or any other hygiene products. Boss Babe, or Karen, fashion can often take from the Baddie aesthetic as well, but while the Baddie exudes an aura of confidence and sex appeal, Boss Babes often wind up coming off as incredibly pathetic and like they're going through something like a mid-life crisis even though a lot of these MLM companies are recruiting them younger and younger (some stories even claim they're getting recruited while in high school). Karen makeup is also heavily influenced by makeup in the early-mid 2010s, but mainly consist of natural looks. Smokey eyes, light blush, and pink eyeshadow are sometimes seen as well. Karens have a tendency to believe they are above everything and are always right, even if they believe in foolish things like anti-vaccine propaganda, flat earth theories, religiousness to the point of fanaticism or believing they are a god (if you see these MLM conferences they tend to go to, it's easy to see how they can get wrapped up in these schemes) or strange forms of spirituality (which can lead to some crossover with the New Age aesthetic, unfortunately), and no matter what they will have a tendency to demand to speak to any establishment's manager, be very health-conscious (especially if they're involved in health food-based MLMs), and/or use an obscene amount of emojis in their messages and posts in a desperate attempt to appear \"hip\" and \"with the trends\". They are obsessed with the pursuit of wealth and status, so they subscribe to this \"fake it 'til you make it\" mentality, but the fact is the vast majority of people who get involved in MLMs usually wind up failing miserably; legit, you have a better chance of striking it rich gambling than you do getting involved in one of these schemes. They will do anything to sell their wares, including lying about the quality or the benefits of using their products. This often leads to them getting reported to the authorities. Here is a list of MLM companies to keep an eye out for that will often employ these #BossBabes into their ranks (Its highly ill advised to link these sites). It should be noted this page is here to serve as a warning just in case you encounter people who showcase this aesthetic as their own and to choose your interactions with them very carefully. The fine folks at the Anti-MLM Coalition have provided you a  list of MLMs here to help you keep an eye out for, just in case if you see these out in the wild. As the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing and businesses were shutting down in compliance with regulations designed to prevent the virus from spreading, the Karens finally discovered the internet as a whole was venting and making fun of their behavior.  In true Karen fashion, they flipped out and attempted to compare calling them \"Karens\" to people calling black people the n-word and was taken to the Digital Supreme Court. In Karen v. The Internet, the Karens attempted to claim that calling them \"Karens\" was sexist (much like how the baby boomers attempted to claim calling people \"Boomers\" was ageist when the term \"OK Boomer\" first started popping up on the internet), but Judge Twitter ultimately ruled in favor of the internet, with the logic being \"If you are comparing two words as being slurs and you can't say one of them, that word is the worst word\".  The Karens are no doubt pitching a fit and trying to look for the manager of the internet, but this has not slowed down referring to them as \"Karens\".  Hilariously, since the Karen meme first started gaining traction, fewer and fewer parents are naming their kids \"Karen\".",

However, different from the English word \"cute\", it is distinct in that it's so diversified that it has spawned many subgenres which often are far removed from the original concept. For example, Gurokawa refers to \"creepy cute\" things and Erokawa to everything \"erotic but cute” which combines adult sexuality with cuteness. The kawaii aesthetic is also a staple in J-fashion, and many of its derivative sub-aesthetics originate from the Harajuku neighborhood and surrounding Shibuya district of Tokyo. The concept of kawaii is often misunderstood in foreign countries and wrongly applied to anything \"chibi\".[1] In ancient Japanese, the words “kawayushi” (かはゆし) and “kaohayushi” (かほはゆし) were used. Different to the nowadays \"kawaii\", they were associated with a negative image, referring to something \"so pitiable one can't stand it\". Later on, those words were replaced by \"kawaii\" and started to take on a positive strength, instead of being seen as a weakness.[2] However, before the term became used the way it is now, it was mainly used by men to objectify women, and during the 60s, it was very common to be catcalled \"Kawaiko-chan\" (かわい子ちゃん), which is similar to the English \"cutie\". Later on, the meaning of \"kawaii\" changed once again when women started to use it to describe everything that is just like them: cute.[3] In the 70s, the number of people who use the term \"kawaii\" exploded, resulting in the birth of kawaii culture. The Japanese word \"kawaii\", which previously was just an adjective, has come to have symbolic value. During that time, the company Sanrio gave birth to Hello Kitty, which soon would become one of the most iconic \"kawaii\" characters in history. Beyond that, \"non-standard girlish script\" (変体少女文字) was introduced as the typeface in 1974, and this overly cute writing style became so popular among high school girls, teachers started to have issues reading their homework. Another change of that time was among girl's manga magazines. Previously, they mostly came with posters and stickers of popular boy groups, similar to western girl's magazines, but in 1975 this changed to \"kawaii\" stationary goods with characters from the mangas printed on them.[4] In 1982, the magazine \"Olive\" (オリーブ) was launched by Heibon Publishing (now Magazine House) and gave birth to the first wave of \"kawaii revolution\" (かわいい革命) as well as \"otome\" culture. The fans of the magazine dolled themself up in ribbons and frills, lace, floral prints, and other girly styles. Popular with those girls that idolized its style were brands that gave off a fairytale-like feel, such as Pink House by designer Isao Kaneko. The designer did not hesitate spreading the new meaning of \"kawaii\" as \"by women for women\" which is precisely why the brand has been considered a leader of spreading kawaii culture ever since. Its followers would collect things that appealed to their sense of cuteness and mix them, expressing their individuality, and this is would evolve into what is referred to as Harajuku or kawaii fashion nowadays.[5] Kawaii visuals are in a range of colors, but are most commonly associated with pastels, with white as a neutral and pink as the most popular color. However, this is not necessary in all of the aesthetic's visuals, as different examples show that this is not the case; for example, neon with Decora and black with some Sanrio characters. Lighting is always bright, with few to no shadows. Photo-editing is highly utilized in kawaii, as people often add additional stickers and sparkles, enlarge their eyes, and smoothen the photo to look more maximalist and hyper-cute. Sweets are a common visual motif in kawaii. These can include cakes, macaroons, flan, cotton candy, iced cookies, ice creams, parfaits, boba and other beverages. These sweets are done in the Japanese style with specific references to the culture, such as having the food shaped like certain characters, elaborate whipped cream decorations, purin pudding, etc., as opposed to Western sweets. Decorations are mandatory, with multiple textures and colors present via sprinkles, drawn-on icing, etc. Strawberries are an incredibly common motif due to repeated use in early artworks and merchandise.[6] Additionally, savory foods may appear in the form of bento boxes with food shaped as different characters. Nature-inspired motifs, such as skies, flowers, and small critters, are also very commonplace in form of minimalistic drawn stars, clouds, rainbows, butterflies, and cherry blossoms. Anthropomorphic illustrated characters, are the most unique and recognizable feature of the aesthetic. The most popular characters originate from the Japanese company Sanrio, which created Hello Kitty, Cinnamon Roll, My Melody, and more that can be viewed here. Another popular company would be San-X, with characters like Rilakkuma, Sumikko Gurashi, Sentimental Circus, Mamegoma and more, which can be viewed here. Other examples include Care Bears, Moomins, Pusheen, various Animal Crossing characters, and different Pokémon such as Pikachu and Squirtle. There are multiple commonalities between these kawaii characters; many of them are simple in design, with features that are simultaneously distinct enough to be different from other competing characters, but also following the guidelines in character design that make characters look friendly and child-like. These include round bases for bodies, large eyes and heads with small arms, and a lack of intense shadow and angularity. These characters' immense popularity allows them to easily be marketed as merchandise, with a variety of stationery, home goods, clothing, and even large vehicles such as airplanes. Human characters could also be classified as kawaii if they are innocent and childlike. These are called Moe, and tend to come from anime and manga, as the trope is from Japanese pop culture. Like the critters, these characters have large eyes, round shapes, and unique colors and outfit designs. Their intense and open displays of emotion are related to people's affection for them, and often appear as either helplessness and/or upbeat cheerfulness.[7] One such character is Hatsune Miku, the most universally recognizable Vocaloid. Gifs and images of these Moe characters often appear in kawaii blogs and websites. Kawaii Future Bass or Kawaii Bass is a subgenre of electronic dance music that combines the Future Bass genre with the Kawaii aesthetic[8]. It emerged in the mid-2010s and it also incorporates elements of Chiptune and Bitpop. The songs tend to be energetic and adorable, often incorporating samples related to anime and gaming culture. Snail's House (also known as Ujico*) is considered to be the pioneer of this subgenre. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

The Kawaii Gamer community gathers on Twitch frequently and tends to be Gen Z.  This differs from other forms of Kawaii in that it contains specific merchandise, room decor, and fashion trends that are more aligned with the Western interpretation of Kawaii, as opposed to actual Japanese Kawaii fashions. showing increased globalization as anime and games reach a larger audience. The objects common in the aesthetic are incredibly replicated, and the aesthetic is shown in TikToks that are dedicated to showing the set-ups of a kawaii gamer. While the aesthetic requires a large quantity of merchandise (as maximalism is common), it is more accessible and casual than actual J-fashion due to the rise of Kawaii culture globally and the increased e-commerce and commercialization of media properties. Kawaii Gamer Girl fashion is highly inspired by the Erokawa, Babygirl, Soft Girl, and Neko aesthetics. Some women in this aesthetic put on the persona of a \"gamer girl,\" where they advertise their love for video games, have a cute physical appearance, and bubbly personality through making TikTok videos and content on Twitch and YouTube. There are also some women who incorporate this aesthetic into their sexual presentation, as the Babygirl aesthetics evolve and grow more popular. Others focus exclusively on room decor/electronics, unboxing merchandise, and collecting inspiration and do not show themselves on camera. These people, typically women, are expressing their femininity and love for these certain characters in a hobby that is traditionally dominated by men and male aesthetics. For example, most gaming merch is in black and red with aggressively sleek detailing, which isn't palatable for many girls. Kawaii gaming aesthetics would thus allow women interested in video gaming to have their own community where they do not have to sacrifice their femininity for their hobbies. Some kawaii gamers also focus on breaking the idea of there being a difference between \"real\" games and \"casual\" games, as many people (especially men) believe that more action and competition-driven games are superior to ones with lower stakes. One notable influence on this aesthetic is the E-Girl, who was also influenced by Kawaii culture but involved more black. Scene culture, and even some sexual imagery inspired the more mature types of Kawaii gamer. Some make-up and fashion trends, such as tennis skirts, heavy blush, and long dyed hair (often in wigs), influenced the outward appearance and gender performance of a kawaii gamer. The aesthetic can take on an either Yume Kawaii palette of pastels and white, rainbow, or more purple and blue neon, which allows for many color variations on the aesthetic. Of course, kawaii gamers tend to show their love for both their passions through combining the two. Technology for gaming in pink and white accents, such as PCs, Nintendo DS, and Switches are the most shown photo subject and is most representative of this interpretation of kawaii. Customized keyboards with decorative keys in multiple colors are one of the entry points into the aesthetic due to their accessibility and variety of models and key caps, such as glowing lights, paw prints, and different colors and fonts for the display. Displays on computer home pages and social media are also important to the aesthetic. Admirers of the aesthetic customize backgrounds of PCs, mouse pads, social media icons and headers, and phone lock screens to fan art of their favourite characters, kawaii art, abstract drawings in pastels, etc. Certain products are iconic and highly sought-after in this community. One of them being the Autofull pink gaming chair with attached bunny ears and a tail, which was popularized by Twitch streamers and gaming YouTubers.[1] Another are cat-ear headphones, which are an example of connecting the Erokawa trope of the anime cat-girl with technology. Most setups also include a cat-paw pillow. Building off on the inclusion of cat-girls, anime girls and women who display cuteness are extremely popular, especially Nezuko Kamado from Demon Slayer, Sailor Moon, and Chika Fujiwara from Kaguya-sama: Love Is War. This also includes VOCALOID characters such as Hatsune Miku. In addition to anime characters, mascots are constantly replicated in merchandise created by popular franchises such as Sanrio and Pokémon. Plushies, themed snacks, mouse pads, stationery, etc. of characters such as Pikachu, My Melody, and Hello Kitty clutter the desks of many kawaii enthusiasts, and having affection for a certain mascot is encouraged. These figurines and plushies are often purchased from subscription boxes, with a comment video format in the community being people opening these products. Similarly, many videos feature Japanese snack openings, where the person on TikTok uploads a video where they arrange Pocky, KitKat, candies, etc. on a platter from either a subscription box or a haul to an Asian grocery store. Boba and Japanese soda is also popular. Many of these are themed after a certain flavor, such as strawberry or matcha. For wall decor, a common thing that differentiates this aesthetic from other Kawaii ones is the use of LED or neon lights in pink or purple tubing. This is a general trend in Gen Z gaming and TikTok communities, but with kawaii shapes such as sakura blossoms or bunny silhouettes. Sakura motifs are also common in general, as it is connected with Japan and is often featured in anime. All of these visuals culminate in set-ups, which are the main mode of carrying across the aesthetic. A set-up is the desk space of a gamer and the place where they watch anime, do work, eat snacks, etc. This is why the set-up is the most prioritized place in the aesthetic, as a kawaii gamer would spend most of their time there. The desk would include the electronics, multiple figurines and plushies, walls with lighting and posters, and snacks in a cluttered, yet cozy arrangement that requires a large amount of things. Typically someone who is in the kawaii gaming aesthetic tend to wear pastel clothes and kawaii outfits. For example skirts and button up tops, bows, hairclips and ribbons are common accessories for this aesthetic. Over sized kawaii jumpers with a skirt is also common. Loungefly sanrio bags are a common bag used by the kawaii gamer community, most notably by Nintendo.Grl.

The following below contains content mainly from Japan. This section includes female content creators who have this aesthetic. VTubers, which are real people who use anime avatars instead of showing their face, are also included. The music associated with the aesthetic tends to be in the VOCALOID, video game soundtrack, chiptune, Otacore and kawaii Lo-fi genres. These are often cheerful sounding, with electronic beats and sound clips of extremely feminine-voiced women exclaiming something in Japanese. In addition, some people who admire this aesthetic may be connected with Hallyu and be K-Pop fans.

Many memes express wanting to have these women as girlfriends to fawn over. Another criticism of Kawaii Gamer may involve the fetishization of East-Asian cultures, which reduces it to an extremely sexualized and commercialized image. This includes stuff like sexualized school uniforms. Many Kawaii Gamers also \"Asianfish\", where a person of another race or ethnicity wears make-up and in some cases, even undergo cosmetic surgery, to look \"East-Asian\". They typically exhibit infantilizing mannerisms (such as puffing out cheeks, having almond shaped eyes, etc.) and perpetuate stereotypes of East-Asian women being seen as \"childlike and submissive\". Sometimes, people will even make this aesthetic their whole personality.",

It is very similar to Nostalgiacore in terms of visuals. While its origins can be traced back to the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s, it appears the aesthetic is a nostalgia-based creation of the 2010s. J-fashion styles, namely Decora, influenced this aesthetic, although Kidcore is less over the top and focuses more on childhood nostalgia and bright colors (Decora is often bright but can be any color scheme). Kidcore differs from Babycore as it is more focused on bright colors, cartoons, nostalgia, toys and accessories, as opposed to soft pastels, stuffies, soft kawaii fashion, and baby items. Both are associated with reclaiming a sense of childhood wonderment. Fairy Kei fashion is sometimes mistakenly called Pastel Kidcore, since it also features retro, nostalgic inspired motifs, but they are in fact different things and Kidcore centers around being bright and not pastel. Common motifs in Kidcore visuals are bright colors frequently used on children's toys, most frequently highly saturated versions of the traditional primary colors (red, yellow, and blue), playgrounds, stuffed animals such as Beanie Babies and TY, robot pets like Furbies, Lisa Frank artwork, rainbows, and other kid themes. Other common themes involved in Kidcore include: Kidcore can also be used in logos, which an example is \"Shayan TV\", in Tatarstan, and Bolajon TV In Uzbekistan. Kidcore fashion is typically colorful and highly saturated, and predominantly utilizes the traditional primary colors, but it does sometimes include neutrals and secondary colors. Fashion pieces include: Kidcore is centered around various types of media. The Aesthetics Wiki staff creates official Spotify playlists for aesthetics, which compile the songs most frequently featured on existing playlists dedicated to those aesthetics. Pages with an official wiki playlist will not include playlists from the public. The architectural variants of kidcore - known as \"Wonka Post-Modern\", or \"Memphis Jr.\" due to it being inspired by the 1980s Memphis aesthetic - predate the rest of the genre, and can be said to have inspired the 2010s popularity via nostalgia. Examples typically come from theme parks and stores which market goods to children such as Toys 'R' Us and Gymboree. Spooky Kidcore is a subgenre of kidcore that mixes the cute things and bright colors of kidcore with Halloween themes, such as witches, skeletons, and jack-o'-lanterns. It often overlaps with Halloween. Loudcore is a subgenre of kidcore which revolves around loud, noisy objects and toys that are associated with childhood. Key motifs include bells, fireworks, birthday party-esque or \"school treasure box\" related items, and instruments such as kazoos. Stickercore is an aesthetic that focuses mainly on children's stickers. Some of the most common types are My Little Pony, Care Bears, Sanrio, Sandylion, and Lisa Frank’s artwork. Anime girls are also seen, but uncommon. The stickers are mostly placed on one's face, but can also go on other parts of the body and objects. Arcade Kid is a subgenre of kidcore that combines youthful and cute kidcore outfits with video games-related clothes and accessories, like Kirby and Animal Crossing merch. Arcade Kid aesthetic is more colorful and brighter than Arcadecore, which is making it more related to Kidcore. See the main page for more information about the more feminine form of kidcore.

This aesthetic often brings either a sense of comfort or disgust, as most images depict a crossover of Ghibli fantasy, and Silent Hill-inspired nightmares. It is commonly confused with Weirdcore and Gurokawa, the latter being based around cute horror themes. Kimoicore is often gore oriented with common themes of monsters, glitches/static, and emotional distress or comfort (i.e. paranoia, mania, bliss). Kimoicore visuals often create a disturbed, confused or grossed out feeling, hence why the name was chosen. This aesthetic often takes on the color palette of Vaporwave or Vintage aesthetics, the imagery associated with Anime aesthetics, then utilizes horror situations and themes to create a sense of unease. Colors that typically appear are vivid with high contrast, or are desaturated with a black and white or faded appearance. While easily confused with Weirdcore, there are several key differences between the two. Weirdcore has fairly random imagery with a collage-like style, often taking place in liminal spaces, however, Kimoicore is a more gore/horror oriented aesthetic with more specific visuals, mainly drawn in anime-like styles, and the focus is often story-based instead of situational. Eyes Eyes are one of the common motifs, filling the scene with a sense of paranoia, anxiety, or helplessness. These days people are under constant surveillance, whether it be social media, the government, and/or the public eye, this being the biggest contribution to an anxious and paranoid society. People living in constant fear, watching and being watched. Another example of this is You, the Spectator, observing, analyzing, and judging the media before you. Hollow, static, & scribbled out faces These motifs are also common, they often symbolize apathy, dissociation, and corrupt state of mind. They can be paired together or on their own, much like the first example in the gallery. Hollow representing apathy or feeling \"empty\", while static and scribbles represent a mental fog or being checkout of reality. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

It's often thought that Kat Bjelland from the band Babes in Toyland was the first to wear and define the look, while her former roommate Courtney Love from the band HOLE was the first to popularize it. Courtney Love commented in 1994 that \"I would like to think—in my heart of hearts—that I'm changing some psychosexual aspects of rock music. Not that I'm so desirable. I didn't do the kinder-whore thing because I thought I was so hot. When I see the look used to make one more appealing, it pisses me off. When I started, it was a What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? thing. My angle was irony.\" The name 'Kinderwhore' was coined by melody maker journalist Everett True in an interview with Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love (1993). The term was mostly used by the media and less by the musicians themselves. Despite the name, the aesthetic has nothing to do with child prostitution. The term comes from the word \"kinder\" (meaning \"children\" in German), and \"whore,\" (slang for a prostitute or sexually promiscuous person (usually female)). The name does not refer to a child prostitute, rather a child and a prostitute, as in two separate archetypes: an innocent child on one side, and a corrupted woman on the other. One interpretation is that it enables women to \"take their innocence back\". An often mentioned inspiration for the style are the musicians Kim Shattuck of the band The Muffs, Christine Amphlett of the band Divinyls or Katie Jane Garside of the band Daisy Chainsaw. The Kinderwhore fashion became a source of inspiration for many designers, such as Hedi Slimane, Batsheva Hay, and even Marc Jacobs. In 2019, Batsheva Hay named Courtney Love's “Kinderwhore aesthetic” as a big inspiration.  Hay said the look was \"so of its time, but also so ahead of its time\". Dark Nymphet and Morute are both heavily inspired by Kinderwhore. Kinderwhore fashion was designed to take the most \"feminine\" aspects of gender roles, inflate them to a cartoonish level, and subvert it all into the rawest, angriest, most badass way possible, where they were not afraid to get as aggressive and confident on stage as their counterparts in the mostly male dominated Grunge scene.  Some elements of Kinderwhore fashion include: Clothing can most easily be found in charity or thrift shops or can be DIYed. Since Riot Grrrl is a style within Grunge, the goal is to not look neat and tidy, damaged clothing is better to use to achieve this specific look. The Riot Grrrl fashion has resurged in recent years due to social media sites like TikTok, Instagram, and Pinterest, with creators like Lipst1ckteeth. Fairy Grunge is a similar style where the wearer doesn't seem as interested in subverting gender norms, but instead just appreciates the aesthetic appeal of the contrast that Kinderwhore set out to accomplish. Fairy Grunge is used to make oneself look more appealing in a way that clashes with Kinderwhore's philosophy, and therefore cannot be called Kinderwhore. Musically The Kinderwhore fashion can cross-over into Riot Grrrl music scene. It can fit alongside their male counterparts in the Grunge scene, taking the world by storm in the 1990s.  Some popular Kinderwhore* bands and artists include: * Please note there aren´t really any self-proclaimed 'Kinderwhore' artists/musicians, since the term was made by the media to refer to it as a style of fashion! While Courtney Love of Hole are best known for Kinderwhore fashion, they are NOT considered part of the feminist driven Riot Grrrl.

Like Queencore is to Princesscore, Kingcore is a more mature variant of Princecore. Themes of power, war, and conquest are more often seen here, as kings are most often viewed as malicious entities; although this is not true for all works or historical accounts. Kingcore aesthetics show through strength and guidance, skill and patience. Those who adopt a Kingcore aesthetic may be seen as the leader of a group. They hold themselves to higher standards, as a way to show worthiness of their title and position. The Kingcore aesthetic wouldn't be complete without confidence and displays of good leadership. A different approach using evil kings as inspiration can prove ill-advised, as this may make the person appear selfish and inconsiderate with a disregard for others. Inspiration can be drawn from patriarchal figures in hierarchy-centered shows and movies, especially those centered around kingdoms. For a darker approach, colors can be toned deeper, and inspiration can be drawn from evil king characters and CEOs. This aesthetic can be great inspiration for modern styles. It tends to overlap with other aesthetics (especially its darker variants) particularly fey styles like Dark Fairycore, Woodland Goth, and Forestpunk. Unlike Princecore, it can be seen (sparingly) worn by men outside of ballet and theater, but is almost never worn by women. Visuals for kingcore coincide with other royalcore visuals. Significant visuals for kings may include: Fashion may be taken directly from historical accounts or may be modernized. Real life examples can include historical figures like King Gustav IV for a more historical approach, or figures like King Philippe of Belgium and King Mswati III of Swaziland for more modern fashion. Fictional examples can include King Henry VIII from The Tudors, King Joffrey Baratheon from Game of Thrones, and King Henry II from Reign. Staples include intricate embroidery, jewel and metal embellishments, darker or richer colors, and long sleeves. Suggestions include:",

The name comes from a contraction with kōkōsei, the Japanese word for high school. Outside of Japan, Kogal is often confused for being the name of a Gyaru fashion whereas in Japanese circles it is only used as the name for teenage Gyaru regardless of what they wear and excludes adult Gyaru who simply wear Nanchatte Seifuku. [1] While the peak period of the classic Gyaru subculture was during the late 1990s and early 2000s, Kogal peaked in the mid-1990s, especially around the period 1994-1995. The aesthetic emerged around 1993 amongst younger girls (especially high school girls and middle school girls) trying to emulate the adult-like sexiness and confident self-assertion of Bodikon gals— something especially common in early 1990s Japan. The 1993 television special Za kogyaru naito (The Kogal Night) introduced the kogal to a mass audience and provided a model for aspiring Kogals to follow— promoting controversial activities popular amongst those older Bodikon women such as prank-calling and enjō-kōsai (compensated dating). Around late 1994, as Bodikon died with the closure of Juliana's Tokyo and the end of magazines such as Heaven's Door, the style of Kogals broke into the mainstream and by early 1995 became commonplace among teenage girls. Kogals were popularly troped in the Japanese media in the mid-1990s as being obsessively trend-conscious. A major influence on the style was J-pop singer Namie Amuro, who in 1994 popularised platform shoes. Her music became a major staple amongst Kogals, and her tanning also became widely adopted by them. The style of Kogals is based around Japanese high school uniforms. Any type of school uniform is fine, although most uniforms tend to have plaid skirts, bows around the neck and sweaters. They are often beige in color. Serafuku (sailor uniforms) are also very popular. Whilst most Kogals wear their actual uniforms, they also popularised the use of 'Nanchatte Seifuku' (fake school uniforms). Kogals add a twist to their uniform in order to make it appear sexier and cuter. They shorten their skirts, wear legwarmers or loose socks and sometimes even add bows or ties to their uniform, even when it isn't a part of their uniform. Some Kogals also buy extra uniforms from different schools and wear them after school, and although it is rarer, older kogals who are out of school buy uniforms to wear. The style is also characterized by dyed hair, and with older girls, tanned skin. Tanned skin has become less common in kogal, however, as tanning in of itself has become less popular among gyarus. Kogals often dyed their hair in blondes, reds and light shades of browns, although sometimes colors such as pink and blues were added if one preferred. Kogal-go was a type of speech that Kogals created, although it is commonly also used within Gyaru too. These words were often a mix of English and Japanese. Some examples are: Decoden is a very popular activity within all of Gyaru, but Kogals are most known for it and decorate almost everything, whether it be using resin pieces, stickers, pearls, cabochons, bows, studs, whipped cream glue and more. Although almost everything can be decorated, commonly decorated objects are phone cases, iPods, consoles, mirrors, lighters, hairbrushes, laptop cases and trinket boxes. These brands are all very popular within Gyaru styles as a whole, however many Kogals also particularly liked these: Since 2016, there has been a trend of new romance-comedy shounen manga being based around Kogal characters.",

However, it still sparked a lot of controversy within the community.

There was also a small attempt to cancel the musical artist Odetari over supposedly \"fetishizing\" Latin-American women, particularly due to one of his songs being called \"I <3 LATINAS\". Another attempt to cancel Odetari occured when misheard lyrics containing a slur were found on one of his songs on Spotify, which wasn't Odetari's fault but rather the fault of either an AI or a person attempting to write the lyrics.

CoHot Topic Kuromicore is a dark feminine aesthetic based on the character Kuromi, who is a white rabbit wearing a devil-inspired attire, by the company Sanrio. In Japan, hardcore fans of the character are also refered to as Kuromiota (クロミオタク). Kuromicore's origins in the dark alternative Jfashion scene have made it a staple in fashion styles such as Yami Kawaii, Dark Girly and Jirai Kei. In the west, it has a strong connection in aesthetics such as E-girl, Pastel Goth, Dark Babygirl, and general dark styles in touch with Japanese aesthetics and trends. It is also paired heavily with Melodycore, its opposite twin aesthetic based on Kuromi's rival My Melody. Clothes in kuromicore vary heavily with the core trait of them having a black, pink, and pastel purple color palette with kuromi motifs. Western kuromicore may follow one or multiple alt fashion styles, usually following those in the Pastel Goth, 2020 Alt, and E-Girl umbrellas. Chokers, belts, harnesses, corsets may be decorated with chains and studs. Platform boots and shoes are paired with striped/fishnet tights or thigh-high stockings. In J-fashion circles, Kuromicore fashion may be more in line with Dark Girly and Goth-Punk attire in addition to western alt styles. In terms of accessories, face stickers, piercings, pointy decorated nails, kuromi-ear headbands, and devil tails are popular. In the west, Kuromicore makeup follows trends popularized on online alternative circles that may be similar to E-Girl makeup. Eyes are decorated with black, hot pink, or purple eyeshadow with winged eyeliner and false lashes. Similarly to Jirai Kei, some wearers may try to make their eyes appear sickly or teary-eyed with reddened coloring, parallelling the \"sickly byojaku\" eye makeup trend in Japan. This eye makeup is done in combination with horizontal blush and dark lipstick. Eastern kuromicore makeup instead favors a \"cutesy yet sickly\" aura. Japanese accounts on tiktok and instagram tend to follow a similar pattern of dark, reddened eyes and desaturated foundation, but with less pronounced lashes, downturned eyeliner, pronounced \"baby-eye fat\" (涙袋), and black circle lens contacts to make the iris appear larger.

It is characterized by laser-like visuals on dark backgrounds, a grid motif, and airbrushed chrome effects. In architecture and interior design, right-angle shapes and a combination of black with reflective surfaces such as chrome and glass are typical. This aesthetic is the source of the 80s love of glass block walls and floor-to-ceiling mirror such as those found on closet sliding doors. Early Vectorcore computer graphics were not meant to be recorded or transferred to film. Indeed they used special screens, nonetheless, they were used as early at 1972 to create animation. From then on and into early 80 they were commonly featured on computer screen in various movies from Star Wars to 2001: A Space Odyssay. The Grid constituted a major set design element in 1981's the Looker, bit the two movies that most imprinted it as a futuristic design on the popular psyche were 1979's Black Hole and 1982's Tron. The laser grid's popularity was a consequence of how convenient, easy to draw it is as a shorthand for technology. This and the recent development of actual laser technlogy at the time also helps to explain its popularity amongst designers, for whom it is immediately reminiscent of gridded cutting mats. Despite the name and its sources, computers would not come to be central in graphic design until well into the 90s, and these grids continued to be drawn by hand even as they faded away into memory. The persistent use of Vectorcore visuals throughout the mid and late 80s is surprising as by then 8-Bit games had fully supplanted vector consoles. As the Laser Grid (sometimes in a more Vectorcore-like presentation rather than a geometric grid) spread within the technosphere, it merged with the heavily airbrushed style ubiquitous in advertising at the time to create a visual that went heavy on chrome looks. The grid pattern then spread, in a limited fashion, to interior design creating a sleek, almost monochrome look that went heavy on reflective surfaces such as chrome, mirrors and glass blocks. The popularity of Art Deco revival at the time (Deco-Luxe) further contributed to reinforce chrome's popularity in interior design. As a result large mirrored surfaces became ubiquitous both inside and outside buildings, cladding the entirety of certain office buildings. In logo design, many companies took inspiration from the striped logo of IBM, which was redesigned in 1962, causing the stripe motif to become ubiquitous in the late 70s and into the 80s: AT&T, Microsoft, Sierra Entertainment (to name a few), as well as the logos for Input and PC Magazine. Although it was largely limited to the technosphere (and even then did not necessarily dominate the advertising language), Laser Grid visuals became a key part of Retrowave aesthetics like Synthwave and, to a lesser degree, Vaporwave. Less commonly, the grid motif also appears in Memphis Lite media. See also Vectorcore, as the aesthetic is more or less directly descended from these games.",

In contrast, Light Academia’s themes are generally positive, focusing on optimism, sensitivity, joy, gratitude, friendship, motivation, and happy endings. Light Academia was created in a Tumblr text post by the user 'plantaires' on January 17, 2019. The user wrote, \"you’ve heard of ‘dark academia’, now its time for ‘light’ academia… wearing light linen sundresses in foreign countries, eating picnics and pastries in the afternoon sun while reading poetry and laughing with your friends, the burning passion and excitement when you finally make a breakthrough in your research, falling asleep in your lovers arms sunkissed and happy… everything is beautiful and hopeful and no one dies.\"[1] As there are no light academia tags, and as demonstrated through its propositional tone, this is the post that created the aesthetic. The dissemination of the term was largely a whim, and it was other users who expanded upon her idea, as opposed to deliberate aesthetic creation, as demonstrated by her confusion in the tags of another text post, where she wrote, \"did I... accidentally coin a term?\"[2] Light Academia utilizes a neutral and desaturated color palette. White, beige/tan, ivory/cream, light brown, gold, and other pale colors make up the aesthetic. The photographs are taken in natural lighting, with generous sunshine, often overlapping with Golden Hour images. Cozy and domestic imagery is a popular motif in Light Academia and contributes to the softer and more loving environment of the aesthetic. Unmade beds with books on the sheets, food (typically coffee, bread and fruit), and cluttered apartments are images that appear more often in Light Academia than Dark. Though rainy weather is embraced like in Dark Academia, calm, sunny weather is at the forefront. Sculpture is always done in white marble and in the styles of Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical. Technique, such as in the illusion of flesh, psychological presence, diaphanous fabric and drapery, is admired. These sculptures are extremely popular because they fit into the Light Academia color palette easily. The artworks utilized in light academia come from the periods typically associated with European civilization: Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical, Academic, Romantic, Aesthetic and Pre-Raphaelite periods are included. However, Light Academia does not emphasize these eras of painting as much as Dark Academia. Rather,  Impressionist art, which uses a light color palette and images of middle class life and nature, making it an overall softer and welcoming atmosphere, is more popular. Baroque, Beaux-Arts and Neoclassical architecture are featured frequently in light academic images, as most of the prestigious campuses, museums and libraries were built in this style. Rusticated stone, wrought iron fencing, white marble, classical columns and generous ornamentation are common traits shared among these spaces. In addition, Haussmannian apartments and streets (the \"classic\" Parisian stone buildings with white plaster molded interiors) contribute to the simultaneous elegant and comforting atmosphere. The romanticization of studying, journaling and letter-writing is demonstrated through appreciation for calligraphy and stationary. Fountain pens and typewriters are proudly displayed and users would often take images of the results of their notebook entries, not unlike Studyblr. However, their writing is cursive and decorations are sparse. Images associated with literature are another common photo subject. Antique books, etchings for chapter pages, screenshots of e-books with highlighted lines, annotations and typography are common. Latin, ancient Greek, English and French are popular in dark academia both as subjects of linguistic study and in aesthetic images of text. Nature photography, often overlapping with Cottagecore, can appear. Fields of grass, bushes of flowers, crawling ivy, and orange groves are some examples. Like Cottagecore, these plants are controlled and mild. Cafe society is also another influence on the aesthetic. Coffee shops are associated with both the flaneurs of 19th-century Paris and the contemporary stressed college students of today. As such, that space is romanticized and images of coffee, people-watching and studying within the space is popular. Light Academia is a style inspired by the love for knowledge, art, and literature. This aesthetic, encapsulating the ideal of a student immersed in their studies, focuses on the appreciation of self-expression through intellectual pursuit. It echoes the architectural beauty of classic university campuses, the romanticism of consuming literature in a sunlit library, and the allure of lively intellectual discussions. Fashion-wise, Light Academia leans towards a blend of comfortable and sophisticated, a collegiate style with a refined twist. Key elements include neutral and earth tones, chunky knit sweaters, tailored trousers, vintage glasses, and a good pair of Oxford shoes. Think of a modern reinterpretation of an Oxford student strolling through the campus in the early spring, book in hand. Like Dark Academia, Light Academia has strong visual roots in Post-Punk. This is particularly in reference to the lighter side of the genre which gave way to indie rock, dream pop, and shoegaze. (The Smiths and Morrissey especially could be considered a massive visual influence to the Light, Dark, and Romantic facets of Academia aesthetics.) In general, it all is about the warm and positive, pleasurable parts of student life. Frequently used examples are: Similar to Dark Academia, Light Academia involves an interest in literature, music, art, history, and learning. Light academia has been criticized for being Eurocentric and in its visuals, literary inspirations, and philosophical themes.[3] Many of the themes are classicist. Some proponents of Light Academia have attempted to combat this Eurocentrism by utilizing academic clothing from non-Western European cultures, and recommending, quoting, and discussing books by non-European, non-English-speaking, and non-white authors. However, visuals from classical antiquity still play a significant role in Light Academia, and the Western canon are a significant part of the philosophy. Western architecture, including church buildings, libraries, museums, and universities, feature frequently in Light Academia images. Haussmann-era Paris and images of domesticity also differentiate Light from Dark Academia. Analysts view Academia aesthetics as a romanticization of the humanities, as modern-day universities have become more and more expensive, as well as competitive. Humanities degrees are seen as luxuries reserved for the elite, with their low earning potential and high cost in comparison to more practical STEM degrees.[4] Critics view this romanticization as incorrect, citing that elite education is more accessible than ever with the modern internet, and that romanticists of liberal arts attribute meaning when there may not be meaning.[5][6] External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

This style is often used in comics, cartoons, and illustrations to create a sense of clarity and simplicity. Ligne Claire was created and popularized by the comic artist Hergé, known for creating the famous comic series called The Adventures of Tintin. Although it was originally closely associated to the Tintin comic strips, it quickly became a popular illustration choice in Walloon/Belgian and French comics made by a diverse range of authors, including Joost Swarte, Yves Chaland, and Charles Burns. Eventually, this style became virtually synonymous with European comic strips.   The term \"ligne claire\" was coined by Joost Swarte in 1977[1], and this style was formerly known as the \"Hergé Style\" or \"Tintin Style\" due to its connotations in popular media. Ligne Claire started to emerge during the 1930s in Belgium as a distinct comic trend. The style is often associated with Hergé, the creator of The Adventuries of Tintin, and the Brussels School of comic artists, which included Edgar P. Jacobs, Jacques Martin, and Bob de Moor and multiple other artists. Hergé developed his signature style out of necessity, as the printing technology of the time limited the number of colors he could use and the complexity of his drawings. The Ligne Claire style quickly became popular in Belgium and France, becoming part of the Franco-Belgian comic tradition. In Europe its influence can be seen in a wide range of comics, from adventure stories to political satire. In the 1970s, the Dutch cartoonist Joost Swarte coined the term \"Ligne Claire\" to describe the style, because many people felt like the term \"Tintin Style\" or \"Hergé Style\" was too vague and didn't feel inclusive to other authors and their artworks. In the 1960s, the Ligne Claire style began to fall out of popularity because many saw it as old-fashioned. However, the style continues to be remembered as an important part of European comic art history and saw resurgence during the 70s. Visuals found in the Ligne Claire aesthetic include:",

The appeal of liminal spaces is often assigned to their frozen and slightly unsettling appearance, but also the indefinite sense of familiarity they evoke. The depicted spaces often include late 20th and early 21th century architecture and furniture, linoleum tilings, ceiling tiles and cool-toned fluorescent lighting that creates a detached, unwelcoming and cold feeling, but the aesthetic has evolved to adapt to a multitude of settings and media formats. On May 12, 2019, an anonymous 4chan user on the site's /x/ paranormal board called for posts of \"disquieting images that just feel 'off'\". The images posted gave rise to what is today popularly known as liminal space; however, while 4chan might've catapulted liminal spaces into the mainstream, the film The Shining (1980), and its depiction of an empty and sprawling hotel, has been identified as one of the main inspirations for a lot of modern-day media pertaining to liminal spaces. Despite this, however, possibly the best-known and earliest example of the liminal space as an Internet sub-culture is The Backrooms; an entry into the pantheon of creepypasta that is described as \"what you see when you no-clip out of reality\". The Backrooms has been adapted into a variety of media, but has been a particularly popular topic in the realm of video games, where no less than 5 games are based on the concept. In videos on YouTube discussing liminal spaces, The Backrooms are a popular point of reference to use when describing the aesthetic as a whole. Subsequent expansions of the Backrooms' lore haven't been received without criticism, however, as many feel the adoption of more traditional horror elements draws away from its uniqueness as a barren liminal space. True to its etymology (\"liminal\" being derived from the Latin word limen, meaning \"threshold\"), the idea of a liminal space encompasses locations that, due to their function, are transitional in nature - hallways, waiting rooms, parking lots and rest stops are some archetypical examples. Liminal space aesthetics are built around the unique feelings of eeriness, nostalgia, and apprehension people describe when presented with such places outside of their designed context; most notably, their function as intermediary points between origin and destination. For instance, an empty stairwell or hospital corridor at night might look sinister or uncanny because these places are usually brimming with life and movement. The absence of external stimuli, such as conversations or the motion of people, creates an atmosphere often described as otherworldly and forlorn. While this definition is the closest to the usual, academic meaning of liminality, it should be noted that liminal space aesthetics evolved to include images of places that are simply nostalgic, dreamlike or uncanny, with the absence of people becoming the only remaining feature of the original concept. Although these are all incorporated parts of the liminal space aesthetic, they are not considered liminal spaces themselves. This expanded scope also gave the phenomenon a wider appeal among those from the X, Millennial and Z generations, who connected the mysterious allure of liminal spaces with their own infancy and cultural memory, usually through the frequent use of locations such as roadside attractions, playgrounds, vacant houses or abandoned malls, but also artifacts such as poor lightning, compression effects and old-fashioned décor. Due to their nostalgic appeal and dreamlike atmosphere, leading many to reflect on the passage of time and yearn for times of innocence and optimism associated with childhood and coming-of-age periods, liminal spaces are also strongly linked with Traumacore, Hauntology and other similar aesthetics. Liminal space aesthetics also have a significant overlap with those of After Hours, since both explore the atmosphere of vacant spaces that are, by nature, easier to find during night time. But while the After Hours aesthetic plays with feelings of peacefulness and tranquillity, Liminal Space's appeal comes from their unsettling atmosphere.  After Hours aesthetics are also generally more grounded in reality, opposed to the dream-like vibe of Liminal Spaces. Liminal spaces are also quite subjective. What appears nostalgic to one person may be more unsettling to another, while some may find the same image bland with no emotions attached to it. There is even debate as to whether it should even be considered an aesthetic, given how much it can rely on cultural hallmarks that vary from place to place. Liminal space aesthetics consists of any room, corridor, or hallway that is big and empty, yet carries an eerie and unsettling vibe with it; this part is key in separating the Liminal Space aesthetic from just a regular photo of an empty room, corridor or hallway. This disconcerting effect can also be achieved with simple lightning tricks, nonsensical architecture, misplaced elements, capturing the mood at the right time of day or photo edits (Vaporwave, Acidwave, and Glitch edits, in particular, can assist in this effect, although applying too much of these can sometimes ruin the liminality of the image), . Some edits of liminal spaces can give the effect of being in a retro horror or RPG video game (as popularized by YouTuber/Instagrammer YOURLOCALBREADMAN) which can tap into either the uncomfortable, the surreal, or could just go full-on Lovecraftian with some of the design choices made in these style of video edits. Empty game servers and maps, mainly those presenting old-fashioned graphics such as GMod, Team Fortress, No Players Online or early CoD instalments, have also been described as liminal. While not a widely recognized aesthetic, \"Calm Liminal\" is a variation of liminal spaces that induce feelings of peace and serenity rather than mystery and tension. Calm liminal spaces are commonly open scenes devoid of detail, but still employ common motifs seen in everyday life to match the liminal definition of \"threshold\". A representative of this genre would be the Backrooms Fandom Wiki author WindXD. Many of his levels depict peaceful realities, snapshots of relief or solitude interplaced in vast, endless waters. Others include the calm light of lamps shining amid a snowy night. Certain types of liminal music can also be considered calm liminal. They are commonly in major keys, and much like their image counterparts, smoothly induce feelings of tranquility. Please refer to the last images from the gallery or read some of WindXD's calm liminal works like \"Peaceful View\" to gain some experience around this sub-aesthetic.

It is found both in a basic, cheerfully oblivious and straightforward form, and in a more ironic format that centres around \"wine mom\" imagery. Slogan merchandise (known as \"word art\" or \"sentiments\" in home decor retail parlance), have long been part of the range of options for homes. In the early 2000s, consumers began to gravitate toward particularly saccharine sayings, including the iconic \"Live, Love, Laugh\" and variants thereof (the saying itself traces back to an early 20th century poem). At the same time, the pre-bubble rise of the McMansion and Home 2K promoted a heavy-handed use of beige-based, often unremarkable decor to maximize resale values. Rae Dunn also began to spread widely after Dunn entered into a licensing agreement in 2003. Another three-word slogan was promoted by Eat Pray Love, with the memoir coming out in 2006 and the movie in 2010. The proclamation of these kind of values became a sort of psychological refuge in the dreariness of the post-2008 real estate crash. Later on, Live Love Laugh also found a niche amongst certain home renovation show. Joanna Gaines of Fixer Upper (2013-2018) was fond of metal wall art with sentiments or presentation typical of Live Laugh Love. Over time ironic takes on the aesthetic began to rise in popularity. While the phrase \"Live Laugh Love\" had its peak of popularity in the 2007-2012 period, the broader aesthetic borne of it has never really gone away, despite the backlash going so far as to call it a \"red flag\".[1] It now features in various graphic design where the feel-good angle is desired for whatever reason, with social media shareables being a prime example.",

Primarily a genre of music, the minimal melody and repetitive cadence of Lo-Fi encourages people to stop in the moment and pay attention to the world around them, as opposed to the often-cynical use of nostalgia in other aesthetics.  Visually, Lo-Fi features muted colors with simple or complex graphics amidst a peaceful scene. Other aesthetics can blend with Lo-Fi, including Vaporwave, Animecore, Cartooncore, Dazecore, and Vintage, so long as the minimalism is preserved. Generally, the aesthetic's origins are as a musical genre can be traced back to the American musician J Dilla and the Japanese musician Nujabes, as both played with a purposely low fidelity sound to make it sound more aged, but the aesthetic's rise in popularity can be traced back to Cartoon Network's late night [adult swim] block, which used a lot of Lo-Fi Hip-Hop beats for their Bumpers (the black screens with white text they'll air between programming and commercials) as well as airing Shinichiro Watanabe's Samurai Champloo, whose theme song was done by the aforementioned Nujabes. On March 18, 2015, the YouTube channel Lofi Girl joined YouTube[1]. The channel is one of the most popular ways of discovering the genre. The channel hosts 24-hour music streams of this type of music all day, as well as themed playlists. As of May 2023, the channel has over 1.5 billion views.[1] Lo-Fi aesthetics often take on the color palette of Vaporwave and the imagery associated with Anime aesthetics, then utilize various Vintage-inspired tones and filters to create an experience that can evoke a nostalgic feeling in the viewer. Colors that typically appear vivid in photographs and drawings will instead be de-saturated and toned down, resulting in a dated or faded appearance (like it's from some time between the 1970s to the 2000s in the pre-HD era). The use of pastels is also commonly incorporated into Lo-Fi visuals, often giving the visuals a dreamy, nostalgic appearance. As with Lo-Fi music, the intentional degradation of image quality is also commonplace. Techniques such as the addition of visual noise, decreased contrast, static filters, and even chromatic aberration may be used for this purpose. While easily confused with Vaporwave, there are several key differences between the two, notably Vaporwave's more prevalent usage of computer-generated and surreal settings in combination with highly saturated colors compared to Lo-Fi's generally more grounded-in-reality visuals.  To add to the longing and nostalgic vibe of Lo-Fi, oftentimes images of vintage toys, dead malls, old VHS tapes, and old photos can be utilized to elicit this effect as well. Lately, a lot of Indie aesthetics seem to take a lot of notes from the Lo-Fi aesthetic, so it can be easy to confuse the two, but the most important distinction is Indie tends to have more of a Rock flavor to its aesthetics while Lo-Fi might go in a slightly pop direction.  It's also not uncommon to see a lot of After Hours or Golden Hour aesthetics blend in with Lo-Fi or to utilize Lo-Fi artists to aid in creating the relaxed vibe it's going for. Fashion-wise, Lo-Fi's pretty forgiving and flexible; as long as it looks good in a VHS or Polaroid-style filter, you can pretty much wear anything and look good without having to break the bank: Vaporwave, Mallgoth, Hip-Hop, VSCO, Preppy, Indie, E-Girl/E-Boy, Softgirl/Softboy, Kawaii, Synthwave, Thriftcore, Hippie, Normcore, you name it and chances are it'll look good with a Lo-Fi filter placed over it.  The most common version of Lo-Fi fashion, however, involves vintage-styled clothes with a washed-out/dull appearance or upcycling/thrifting old pieces into something new to aid in this Lo-Fi style. There are many primary genres of Lo-Fi music, but all share the feature of heavy usage of intentional sound quality degradation to achieve a more analog feel. High frequencies are also commonly avoided or minimized through things such as EQ and Low-Pass filters, resulting in a muted, low-intensity aura. Some of the types of Lo-Fi genres include seasonal mixes, as well as feelings (such as sad, lonely, and joyous). Lo-Fi summer mixes are the most common. By far the most popular of the Lo-Fi musical aesthetics, Lo-Fi Hip-Hop is a predominantly instrumental genre primarily designed to evoke feelings of nostalgia or calm. This genre commonly features songs with low and mid-tempos between 70s and 90s beats per minute, with 85 being a particularly common choice among artists. Samples from anime or other sources of recorded speech are frequently inserted into this music, and, while far less common, singing and rapping do occasionally appear in the genre as well. It is not to be confused with chillhop, a closely related jazz-based hip-hop sub-genre that utilizes much less intentional sound signal degradation and typically displays higher tempos, clearer mixes, and more bouncy properties instead. High frequencies are also not as avoided in chillhop as they are in Lo-Fi. Oftentimes, Lo-Fi is used to help one focus while studying, writing, reading, or performing other solo-activities that require concentration. Artists in the genre include: Certainly the least well-known Lo-Fi genre, Lo-Fi House has been described as listening to music played at a nightclub from the outside. Lo-Fi House tends to take many musical cues and inspiration from 80's and 90's house music in particular, but still maintains the sense of nostalgia and relaxation that its hip-hop counterpart has, despite having more of a \"dancey\" beat. Artists in this genre include: Chillwave (sometimes referred to as Lo-Fi Synthwave or Glo-Fi) is a music microgenre that emerged in the late 2000s. It is characterized by a faded or dreamy (or Lo-Fi) retro pop sound, escapist lyrics (frequent topics include the beach or summer), psychedelic or Lo-Fi aesthetics, mellow vocals, low-to-moderate tempos, heavy effects processing (especially reverb), and vintage synthesizers.  Because of its overall aesthetic choices, Chillwave often finds itself getting confused with Vaporwave (which is made all the more confusing when Vaporwave is sometimes referred to as a subgenre of Chillwave). Chillwave loosely emulates 1980s electropop and engages with notions of memory and nostalgia. It was one of the first music genres to develop primarily through the Internet. The term was coined in 2009 by the satirical blog Hipster Runoff to describe indie acts whose sounds resembled incidental music from 1980s VHS tapes. Its most prominent artists included Neon Indian, Washed Out, and Toro y Moi, who gained attention during 2009's \"Summer of Chillwave\". Washed Out's 2009 track \"Feel It All Around\" remains the best-known Chillwave song.  Artists in this genre include: External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

The term is a combination of “Heroin Chic” which glamourizes an unhealthy and deathly, detached style, and \"Lobotomy\" - a procedure that was executed on mental patients during the 1950s and caused them to act mentally detached and out of place. Many lobotomy-chic girls jokingly state how they need to get this procedure, pointing at the aesthetic’s twisted-dark-humor nature. What distinguishes this aesthetic from other online-feminine aesthetics is the focus on apathy and “not caring” as a means of being powerful and attractive; instead of characterizing yourself as a strong, bossy woman (for example, like the waif aesthetic) or contrary to that, showing femininity through being delicate and soft, the lobotomy chic aesthetic doesn’t practice either, and instead its main goal is to come across as broad and undefinable as possible; you act uninterested and unbothered to maintain the same performance of powerfulness and independence but in a different manner. As Fisher-Quann writes: ”[Lobotomy-chic] still cares about being sexy, but knows there’s nothing sexy about caring too much. And in times of discord, chaos, and fear, a cultural descent into nihilism makes sense.”[1] Due to its focus on broadness and obscurity, it's hard to precisely define the aesthetic visually, though it is recognizable due to its tendency to appear \"niche\". Usually, lobotomy-chic references 90s, early 2000s, and even early 2010s aesthetics, by the use of flash photography, wearing messy/no makeup, preppy clothes styled in an unorganized manner, and Catholic/Christian symbolism (mostly used ironically). The visuals of this aesthetic will mostly focus on places/fashion/pictures that feel \"out of place\" and esoteric (for example— preppy school girls photographed in liminal spaces), to enhance the effect of dissociation. Notably, a specific style of photography plays a major role in this aesthetic. Usually there will be use of flash photography, obscure settings and irrelevant objects, feminine clothing, messy hair and makeup accompanied by the pose of the \"dissociated pout\" or an eye roll - looking uninterested and effortless, like you weren't aware of the photograph being taken. There's a tendency to look numb, almost as if you were really lobotomized. As stated before, the motive of the aesthetic is to act detached and uninterested in our reality. The main goal is to be as effortlessly sexy as possible. This attitude is usually derived from a nihilistic approach to life, which is also a key value of this aesthetic- you're detaching from reality since there's no meaning to it and nothing good about it. Ironically, this article about the aesthetic itself doesn’t match the aesthetic’s values of vagueness and irony; since acknowledging it and showcasing it as a structured style that can be performed in a certain way reduces its purpose of effortlessness and undefined-ness.",

It grew from young women's desire to dress for themselves in a way that disregarded other people's opinions and women's fashion catered to the male gaze. The style is characterized by a distinctive silhouette, achieved from wearing petticoats underneath dresses or skirts with a specific cut. Decoration associated with historical girls' clothing, such as lace, bows, and ruffles, are a mandatory component of the fashion, but there are different substyles that utilize variations on this to create a different aesthetic. This fashion is heavily associated with certain brands specializing in Lolita and different substyles, and Lolitas must purchase their clothes through these stores and the secondhand market instead of typical fashion retailers, which would not have such clothes. Lolita is a subculture that revolves around fashion, so only people who wear the fashion are considered a part of it. Like other fashion subcultures, the emphasis is always on the clothing and the visuals not associated with the fashion are based on other aesthetics, such as Goth. However, there may be a \"lifestyle\" component to Lolita, wherein some Lolitas participate in princess-like activities such as tea-drinking. Participating in lifestyle elements is less popular and considered unnecessary from 2018-2020 onwards, and the fashion has always been focused on collecting garments and coordinating pieces together. In addition to wearing the clothes, there is a tight-knit community with a shared history, inside jokes, a strong criticism culture, and multiple discussions that take place both in real life through local meet-ups and on social media spaces such as Discord channels, Facebook groups, the now unpopular LiveJournal, and the 4chan board /cgl/, which also includes cosplay. Tradition and following the general guidelines of Lolita is mandatory, and low-quality garments and bad styling is highly discouraged. For more information on Lolita, feel free to visit the Lolita Fashion Wiki. Lolita as a fashion has a long history with more than a single true origin. While the sweeter side of the fashion evolved from the fans of Otome (maiden) style brands during the 80s, the darker side has its roots among visual kei fans that were also known as \"Trance Gals\" (トランスギャル) around that time. The style in its current form came about in the 1990s, where it was photographed on the streets of Harajuku and featured in magazines like Fruits, Kera, and eventually Gothic & Lolita Bible was launched with a focus on it in 2001. The movie \"Kamikaze Girls\" released in 2004 resulted in a widespread knowledge of Lolita as the name of the fashion among the general public within Japan. Before it was given a name, the fashion was generally seen as a \"shoujo\" style and it is assumed that Lolita was likely choosen because it sounded like a fancier word for an innocent girl. In order to differentiate from the book and to avoid adult content to show up, the fashion's name is commonly written as \"ロリィタ\" with a long \"i\" in Japanese instead of \"ロリータ\".[1] A person should also never come into Lolita spaces with the intent on sharing sexual feelings associated with DDLG, as the aesthetic is trying to escape sexualization and has had multiple encounters with daddy doms and sissy harassment. Much of this stems from a misconception that Lolita is related to Nymphet fashion due to the name, and that hyperfeminine presentation is equivalent to childlike presentation. The goal of Lolita fashion is to dress akin to a feminine doll, not a child. Outside Japan, Lolita fashion has gained a strong foothold. Most lolitas gather together to form communities with other lolitas close to them. These communities gather together and wear the fashion in meetups, where they can enjoy the company of others who wear the same interests. Lolita communities also have a huge online presence, allowing people in rural areas to communicate, trade, and sell. The style is not mass-marketed outside Japan, though small stores have emerged. Baby, The Stars Shine Bright, and Angelic Pretty both operate stores in Paris and San Francisco. Numerous indie brands and resellers have popped up all over the world. The Chinese site Taobao hosts scores of lolita retailers who are can sell their designs internationally with shopping services like Spreenow. The lolita secondhand market is booming on sites like LaceMarket and Facebook Marketplace. A full Lolita outfit is called a \"coord\" or coordinate. Every outfit will include a dress or skirt to achieve the proper lolita silhouette. Dresses are made with very full skirts to accommodate a petticoat. Lolita dresses are categorized as either JSKs or OPs. JSKs, or jumperskirts, are sleeveless dresses normally worn over a blouse, and OPs, or one-pieces, are worn without a blouse. The tops worn with JSKs or skirts are either blouses or cutsews, which are tops made of jersey fabric. If the sleeves don't reach the wrists, it's customary to wear wrist cuffs or bracelets. Shoes known as \"tea party shoes\" are the most popular option for footwear, but Mary Janes, boots, low heels, and Rocking Horse Shoes are worn just as often. Socks or tights keep the outfit balanced from head to toe. Lolitas wear many different styles of headdress and hairstyles to balance out their skirts. Many other accessories can be worn with the fashion- other items include bloomers, wigs, jewelry, gloves, coats, capes, parasols, or bags. Lolita can be divided into different substyles, notably Classic, Sweet, and Gothic, with multiple minor styles. Is a more mature style of Lolita that focuses on elegance rather than cuteness. It is much more historically inspired than the other substyles. A-line skirts are more popular in this style for their more demure shape. Colors and patterns used in classic Lolita are more subdued than the other styles. Popular colors are brown, wine red, sage green, cornflower blue, and ivory. This style features lots of solid colors but floral themes are popular, as well as prints of checkers, nature, tartan, and historical art. Popular headdresses include bonnets, bows, and berets, although any accessory is possible as long as it complements the coord. Shoes and accessories are less whimsical and more functional. Bags tend to be simple, but it isn't unheard of to see a purse shaped like a chess piece or a violin. The makeup used in classic Lolita is often more muted and natural, highlighting the Lolita's natural features. Classic Lolita brands include Juliette et Justine, Innocent World, Victorian Maiden, Triple Fortune, and Mary Magdalene. Is one of the most popular lolita substyles. This style is characterized by lighter, brighter colors and more whimsical motifs. It shares the same shape as other styles but is generally known to be \"poofier\", with larger petticoats. This style will often contain more trimmings, like lace, bows, and ruffles. Popular colors are baby pink, light blue, yellow, and white. Prints often feature fruit, flowers, lace, bows, sweet foods, candy, cute animals, and ribbons. Headdresses, bonnets, and bows are a popular hair accessory to the sweet Lolita look. Shoes are typically tea party shoes because of their cute design. Bags and purses will often take the shape of fruits, crowns, hearts, stars, and stuffed animals. Makeup for sweet lolita is very whimsical and pretty. Pastel colors and subtle glitter are popular elements to balance out the decadence of the dress. From 2009-2014, sweet lolita was all the rage and it was very popular to wear multiple hair accessories, a wig, circle lenses, fake lashes, deco nails, and wear more elaborate makeup. That style is now called OTT (Over The Top) sweet lolita. Examples of Sweet Lolita brands are Angelic Pretty, Baby, The Stars Shine Bright, and Metamorphose temps de fille. Is characterized by its darker aesthetic. This substyle is a fusion of lolita fashion and the Japanese gothic subculture of the 1990s. Gothic Lolita fashion is characterized by darker colors and themes. It tends to be more experimental. Popular colors include black, grey, navy blue, dark red, purple, white, and ivory. It is common to see motifs of crosses, gothic architecture, bats, coffins, and chandeliers. Gothic lolita accessories can be more experimental. Rectangle headdresses, bonnets, and bows are popular, but you can also see wide-brim hats, crowns, horns, or antlers. Shoes vary widely- Mary Janes, boots, and platform shoes are all acceptable. Bags and purses can be simple or shaped like coffins or bats, etc. Makeup for gothic lolita can be dark and dramatic. Black is popular for the eyes and lips, but there is no end to what matches a black dress. Brands that exemplify the Gothic lolita style include Atelier-Pierrot, Atelier Boz, Alice and the pirates, and Moi-même-Moitié. Moi-même-Moitié was the first gothic lolita brand, founded by visual kei rock musician Mana in 1999. Mana was the first figurehead of the fashion and is often jokingly referred to as a god. His brand released two lines of clothing, Elegant Gothic Lolita (EGL) and Elegant Gothic Aristocrat (EGA). EGL has still used as a label for the lolita community and the EGA line started Aristocrat fashion. Is a sub-style of Lolita that is inspired by Western punk. It uses similar motifs such as tartan, deconstruction, chains, studs, safety pins, asymmetrical hemlines, rips, grommets, buckles, and spikes. It is inspired by Vivienne Westwood and her influences in the UK. Unlike the Western punk style, Punk Lolita can consist of frilly skirts paired with cutsews or a more delicate blouse with a tougher skirt, and then accessorized with feminine accessories to lighten the look. Print motifs are crowns, butterflies, roses, playing card suits, skulls, and grungy or slightly creepy cute characters. Is a Lolita style inspired by the vast open countryside and often, Victorian farms. It is often a mix of Sweet Lolita and Classic Lolita. The Country Lolita style is often marked by the use of wicker or straw accessories such as basket purses or straw hats. Sometimes the addition of straw accessories is the only defining feature between Country and Classic or Sweet Lolita. Gingham and food prints are popular for this style. It's also common to see straw hats or wicker bags. Think Anne of Green Gables or Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. Is the old (90s, early 2000s) version of lolita fashion. It is visually very different from modern lolita, so it is often referred to as a separate sub-style. Compared to lolita now, it was more \"frumpy\". Fabrics were often solid, tartan, or gobelin. Petticoats, matching, and a full coord of lolita pieces were unnecessary. Old school lolita is still frequently worn in this day and age, much to the delight of nostalgic veterans. Main article: Boystyle Also known as Ouji or Dandy depending on the substyle, is a Japanese street fashion which, like Aristocrat, is frequently associated with Lolita; it is not considered a Lolita style but shares many aesthetics with Lolita since it is the masculine counterpart of the style. Despite being the male equivalent of Lolita, Boystyle can be worn by people of all genders, just as Lolita can be. It can feature a lot of elements such as flowers, makeup, and accessories, which are not seen as typically masculine, but can also have just as many substyles as lolita (e.g. sweet, gothic, classic, and more). These styles of Lolita are based around certain motifs that often connect to the substyles above. They are different from substyles in that they are themed around a certain profession or persona, with a more limited color palette and coording capability in comparison to the broader substyles. This list contains works that either center around Lolita or heavily inspired its aesthetic. Most of the works do not revolve around Lolita fashion in itself as their topic, so don't expect any educational content on how to wear it. Artists incorporating Lolita include: Lolita has often been criticized for being an elitist fashion with mean-spirited individuals who overly judge others. In the subculture, there is a belief that there is a proper way of wearing the fashion, and a wrong one. When people who are new to Lolita often are not familiar with outfit-making and clothing quality post their outfits, there will be responses giving constructive criticism that would be more strict and at times intimidating than what people are used to from other fashions and hobbies. If a person refuses to accept the criticism (which often involves a large time and money investment), the community would shun the poster and might make fun of them in places dedicated specifically to discussing outfit fails. There is also criticism when it comes to buying Lolita fashion. The price for a full outfit is a lot higher than in conventional fashion due to the sheer number of pieces required in making it, with clothing from the core Japanese brands being valued higher than cheaper alternatives. Because of this, some people, mostly those who are new, criticize Lolita for being too expensive. In return, established Lolitas are often confused by such claims, highlighting that owning Lolita fashion is a privilege and not a necessity for living, while referring to secondhand sales as a cheap alternative to buying new Lolita clothes. In addition, attempts to do the fashion on a budget are often not considered \"good\" Lolita because clothing not intended for Lolita has a tailoring unsuitable for the fashion, and cheaper brands often have an aesthetic that is seen as unpolished in comparison to the established Lolita brands. More invested Lolitas may see those who don't invest much in their wardrobe as not being as serious as Lolitas who spend more. Additionally, the online community can be actively and unjustifiably malicious. On 4chan's /cgl/ board, there is a group of self-proclaimed Lolitas that are TERFs (female transphobes) and/or are very fatphobic. Those wearing the fashion while not being cis female or slender are often called \"ita\" (Japanese Lolita slang for \"painful\") despite wearing proper Lolita outfits. In the board, people are often called slurs, accused of being sexual predators, labeled as cringe, and made fun of in deeply personal way in the \"ita thread\", which is dedicated to posting people who are deemed itas. This even extends to women who are simply not conventionally attractive. Vendetta posting is also incredibly common on /cgl/. Usually caused by interpersonal conflicts, a person would try to cyberbully a Lolita through the ita thread in an effort to get them to leave the fashion. In many cases, Lolitas have left the community due to the harassment caused by those toxic posts. However, note that not all Lolitas are toxic, and the community can be kind and welcoming so long as a Lolita curates their online experience.

Lounge music is a type of easy listening music popular in the 1950s and 1960s. It may be meant to evoke in the listeners the feeling of being in a place, usually with a tranquil theme, such as a jungle, an island paradise or outer space. The range of lounge music encompasses beautiful music–influenced instrumentals, modern electronica (with chillout, and downtempo influences), while remaining thematically focused on its retro-space-age cultural elements. The earliest type of lounge music appeared during the 1920s and 1930s, and was known as light music. In the 21st century, the term lounge music may also be used to describe the types of music played in hotels (the lounge, the bar), casinos, supermarkets, several restaurants, and piano bars.

The forms of love that the aesthetic specifically focuses on are affectionate, dopamine-filled, and \"gushy.\" It can involve both requited and unrequited relationships, with both crushing on someone from afar and the rituals of dating being shown in these images. Relationships could be both new and juvenile or old and familiar. The more mature and philosophical or seductive and erotic aspects of love are not featured, as visually, these often do not match the visuals and younger audience of Lovecore. However, people who enjoy the aesthetic are not necessarily actively crushing on anyone or in a relationship depicted in the aesthetic. The aesthetic largely speaks about crushes and relationships in the theoretical, with there not being a true person that the original poster is thinking about. People who enjoy romance fiction, queer people who celebrate love, and people who wish for romantic experiences are some examples of people who appreciate the aesthetic. Visually, Lovecore tends to focus on the commercialization of love through Valentine's Day decorative trends. The rituals associated with romance are also heavily featured, especially in text. The aesthetic has substyles that can emphasize vintage, anime or Cottagecore visuals. Lovecore originated on Tumblr but later spread to many other platforms such as TikTok and Pinterest. Popular motifs include hearts, boxes of chocolate, lipstick, love letters, cupid, angels, and the colours red and pink. There are also at times vintage elements present in the form of scans of Valentine's Day cards written in the 1950s and 60s. There is sometimes overlap with anime in the form of pink manga edits and images of anime characters with hearts in their eyes. Lovecore fashion is a mix of lingerie, angel wings, satin dresses, and just general formal date wear, though sometimes people who identify with the aesthetic adopt a softie look or opt for graphic t-shirts with the aforementioned themes.

It is used for 3D art and video games, usually ones created by indie developers. Low poly was originally used to improve performance in games running on low powered consoles in the 1990s, but with technological advancements, it is now embraced by developers as an intentional stylistic choice. The way modern low poly is utilized as an art form heavily connects to Modernism and its rejection of Realism. Low poly art embraces being unique and different from reality, opposing the many games focusing on having the most photorealistic graphics as possible.[1] A key element of low poly is only having a small amount of polygons in the model, resulting in the model having a blocky and triangular shape. \nFlat shading is a method that is often used in low poly to emphasize the individual polygons, whereas otherwise smooth shading is used to give a more blended look. Originally, games used textures tend to conceal the low polygon amount of the model and make the scene look more realistic. Although at the time people were blown away by the realism, this look tends to feel uncanny now because of the contrast between the attempt at realism and low quality graphics. Modern low poly typically uses vibrant colors with very simplistic color palettes in order to emphasize the low poly look. The old techniques of textures are sometimes still used in aesthetics trying to recreate these old styles. In addition to the modern form of low poly, there are also styles attempting to recreate the feeling of the original use of low poly in old games.

The textures contrast with normal low poly, being pixelated, rough, and complex. A PS1 demake refers to recreating a modern game in the PS1 style. They're usually just made as art for YouTube videos, but a few are actual playable games. The PS1 aesthetic is often used for indie horror games. The low graphics obfuscate details and give an uncanny feeling to players.[2] EmotionStation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther names\nESX, PlayStation 2\n\n\nDecade of origin\n1990s\n\n\nCreator/s\nSteves Peeps\n\n\nKey motifs\nAnti aliasing deficiency, 24-bit color, dynamic weather effects\n\n\nRelated brands\nSony The EmotionStation aesthetic is a sub-aesthetic of low poly based graphics of the PlayStation 2. The name was coined by designer Steves Peeps in 2023, who named it after the Emotion Engine, the central processing unit in the PlayStation 2. This style is notable for its anti-aliasing flaws as well as hyper dynamic weather effects. Its faux photo realism is also a prominent visual component of this style.

It is a common theme for the protagonists to need to balance their school lives, personal lives, and their responsibilities of saving the world as a Magical Girl. The aesthetic is often hyper feminine and very in touch with expressing emotion freely, both positive and negative. Magical Girls are often in a team of young girls, destined to save the world. These characters often have their own designated color, weapon, and power assigned to them, although which colors, weapons, and powers can vary. Alongside these color coded costumes, a very iconic part of what makes a Magical Girl a Magical Girl visually is the animated transformation from a normal young girl into her Magical Girl identity. Sally the Witch by Mitsuteru Yokoyama was the first Magical Girl anime to air in 1966, whilst Himitsu no Akko-chan was the first Magical Girl manga (first printed in 1962), but the most well known and influential Magical Girl anime in pop culture is, for now, Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon (often shortened to Sailor Moon) by Naoko Takeuchi. Magical girl-inspired fashion, also known as Mahou Kei, shares many visual similarities with Fairy Kei. Beyond the casual outfits with magical girl print, there is also many frilly sailor uniforms and over-the-top lolita dresses inspired by the outfits from the various series. Handmade transformation  compact brooches and magic wands are popular accessories. Different to other styles, wigs are very common to be worn due to the extensive styling that gives a more otherworldly feeling to the outfit.

In the 2010s, it was shortened to MLG and began to be associated with a genre of internet memes that were based around video games. It usually is an video-based aesthetic, and the videos feature compilations of various Esports memes and flashing rainbows.

In meme generationology, MLG is included as part of the \"Dank Meme Era\", and its sucessor is considered to be Surreal Memes and Deep Fried Memes, which together make up the \"Surreal Era\". MLG memes started out as a parody of professional gaming montages, incorporating clips of Call of Duty, Esports teams such as FaZe Clan, and Dubstep music. Doritos and Mountain Dew were also associated with MLG due to often collaborating with Call of Duty. As MLG evolved, it incorporated more random references to popular media and memes at the time, such as Doge and the Illuminati.

Obsessed with weapon tropes depicted in anime, action movies, or other violent fiction, the Mall Ninja is characterized by clumsy threats or posturing for superiority. Mall Ninja is an offshoot relation to the \"Internet Tough Guy.\" The main aesthetic concept of the Mall Ninja is that of being a poor mimicry of a fictional badass character. Their weapons, which they often carry in the eponymous malls, tend to be tacky and based on items that they have seen in anime. For example, they would have unnecessary ornamentation like colors, have no practical function, and are made of poor quality materials. Likewise, the clothing that they can typically be seen wearing is cheap, may fit poorly, and looks tacky. This is not based purposefully on camp, but rather being inexperienced in judging quality. Most of the aesthetics and hobbies also overlap with Weeaboos. In fact, one of the main motivators of becoming a Mall Ninja could come from wanting to be like an anime character or because of the Dunning-Kreuger Effect which is defined as \"a cognitive bias whereby people with low ability, expertise, or experience regarding a certain type of a task or area of knowledge tend to overestimate their ability or knowledge. Some researchers also include in their definition the opposite effect for high performers: their tendency to underestimate their skills.\"[1] For example, a Weeaboo may mistake the hours of anime they watched as being hours of watching weapons training. These two groups, Weeaboos and Mall Ninjas, also share similar stereotypes such as a lack of hygiene, anti or asocial personality traits, \"basement-dwelling\", and an over-obsession with their hobbies. As described by the Internet history site \"Know Your Meme,\"[2] the term was first documented being used around a thread on Glock Talk, a forum for gun owners, in 2001. Gecko45, a mall cop (sometimes derogatorily referred to as a \"2.5\" insinuating a mall cop is equal to half of one police officer which is a \"5-0\"), was paranoid about being shot on the job and talked about constantly wearing a bulletproof vest while having a firearm with him. The following is his defense of these habits which ironically, though unintentionally, became the very first Mall Ninja post. Linked here is an archived version of the original thread responsible for coining the term.[3] After this incident, the fact that Gecko45 worked in a mall and had claimed to be adept at skills held by real ninjas the term \"Mall Ninja\" became popular on the Glock Talk forum and spread to other internet communities as Mall Ninjas appeared on other social media sites such as Facebook and 4chan. In 2012, the subreddit r/mallninjashit[4] was created for the purpose of posting images of Mall Ninja weapons, accessories, and memes. Later the same year, a page related to this cultural niche appeared on \"Rational Wiki,\" a wiki-like site similar to this one with the purpose of documenting internet philosophy.[5]",

Initially conceptualized as a subgenre of Vaporwave, it has evolved into its own aesthetic that elicits a sense of nostalgia in many Gen Xers and Millennials (and potentially older members of Gen Z) using imagery of shopping centers and remixed anonymous soft rock muzak one might hear in a shopping mall. It can range from simply invoking the nostalgic memories of a trip to the mall as a child or it can go into the surreal category by turning up the echo and invoking the imagery of a long-abandoned mall still echo soft Muzak-y sounds throughout its long-empty and decaying halls. Abandoned malls can also have aspects of Liminal Space. But, of course, they aren't the same. As said before, it is meant to elicit nostalgia with visuals and music of shopping centers and music that is played there. Liminal Space's visuals are unsettling and bring back strange or bad memories. Visually, Mallsoft aesthetics focus around both the golden era of malls (where they would often be full of customers shopping) or the current state of malls where, outside of a few exceptions, most are struggling to keep the doors open and are on the verge of shutdown. The former is often achieved by playing old recorded footage or movie scenes from the 80s, 90s, and 2000s within malls or through retro TV commercials for either malls or shops that were particularly popular in malls. The latter, however, plays into After Hours or Liminal Space, and this is, perhaps, the most popular variation on the Mallsoft aesthetic, as it plays into the jarring feeling of being in an empty space that normally (or used to be) so full of life and foot traffic, be it from people shopping at the multitude of stores, people going to the food court to get a quick bite to eat, or just the mall walkers getting their steps in for the day. This style of Mallsoft was made popular by the likes of YouTubers like Dan Bell and Retail Archaeology. However, contrary to popular belief, not all malls are dying out, and Mallsoft can include taking a visit to malls that are thriving even to this day and blending that into the Mallsoft experience, albeit in a more contemporary direction. This variant of Mallsoft, though, is incredibly rare as most desire the empty spaces and liminality of the modern mall to be the core of their Mallsoft experience. Fashion-wise, Mallsoft can borrow from a variety of fashions that you could've bought in the heyday of malls that range from a corporate suit and tie to the latest trends of the 80s/90s/2000s. What many consider to be the modern-day preppy fashion can find its roots around this era via companies like Abercrombie and Fitch/Hollister, American Eagle, Old Navy, Aeropostale, or Pink (this isn't to be confused with the traditional Preppy aesthetic, whose aesthetic traditions are carried on via the Academia aesthetic family). For those that want to take it in a slightly edgier direction, one can easily draw inspiration from the Mallgoths of the era who would often hang out either in the food court or outside of the mall entrance when they aren't inside either Hot Topic, Torrid, or Spencer's Gifts. For more information on how to dress in those particular styles, please visit the appropriate pages. Musically, Mallsoft started as a subgenre of Vaporwave, where it took the soft, muzak-y sounds and corporate lounge music often piped in over the mall's PA system and proceeded to distort and twist the sound to give the feeling of walking around a mall either late at night or in a dead mall in some hazy, long-repressed memory. Some of the most prominent artists in this subgenre include: Another common trend within Mallsoft aesthetics is to take a variety of popular songs (be it contemporary hits or classic stables) or traditional Vaporwave tracks and adding effects to the song to make them sound like they're being played in an empty mall where the waves of sound echo off of every individual surface within.",

Imagery such as mangroves are also prominent. The Manguebeat  movement is known for being critical in nature. Pioneers of the movement include Chico Science (from the band Chico Science & Nação Zumbi) Fred04 (from the band Mundo Livre S/A), Mestre Ambrósio, the band Sheik Tosado, the band Comadre Fulozinha and the band Via Sat. The main symbol associated with the movement is a crab. People who participate in Manguebeat are known as Manguegirls and/or Mangueboys. It was a reaction to the lack of opportunities for young local artists and musicians, as well as an expression of the unique cultural identity of the region. The movement blends elements of traditional Northeastern music, such as maracatu, coco, ciranda, and embolada, with influences from rock, hip-hop, funk, and electronic music. The term \"Manguebeat\" refers to the mangrove region, a coastal ecosystem area in Recife, symbolizing the connection between urban culture and Northeastern cultural traditions. The Manguebeat movement also had a strong political and social dimension, aiming to address issues such as social inequality, marginalization, and environmental preservation. The album \"Da Lama ao Caos,\" released by the band Chico Science & Nação Zumbi in 1994, is often considered a milestone of Manguebeat. The album features an innovative blend of rhythms and lyrics addressing social and cultural issues in the region. Unfortunately, the rise of Manguebeat was interrupted in 1997 with the premature death of Chico Science in a car accident. Nevertheless, the movement left a lasting legacy, influencing subsequent generations of musicians and artists in Pernambuco and throughout Brazil. The Manguebeat movement was not only about music but also embraced various forms of artistic expression. Visuals often included vibrant and eclectic imagery that reflected the cultural diversity and energy of the movement. The clothes of Chico Science and similar people were heavily used as a form of criticism in the Manguebeat movement. Rules in regards to fashion is to dress with what you have, with the main characteristic being to value your local cultures. Fashion typically includes the following: [2]",

The concept of a Mary Sue character heavily influenced the world of Internet fandoms, fanfiction and animation memes during the decade of the 2010s. The term is often used in a pejorative manner because the characters are seen as very unrealistic and unrelatable, and often deemed \"cringe\". Some Mary Sue characters were created as an attempt to stand out from the others, while many were made by Internet trolls as a way to outrage people online (Parody Sue). The masculine equivalent of a Mary Sue is a Gary Stu, and its polar opposite is an Anti-Sue. The term \"Mary Sue\" was first used in 1973, originating from a satirical Star Trek fanfiction story called \"A Trekkie's Tale\", written by Paula Smith. The story parodied the idealized female characters that were common in Star Trek fan fiction at the time. The term gained popularity and was later applied to characters in all genres of fiction, and it is now often used to criticize characters who are seen as being poorly written or unrealistic. The Quirky trope inside the Mary Sue stereotype, like the name implies, is based around characters that have a heavy amount of \"quirks\" or \"special\" characteristics. This can encompass magical powers, bright clashing colors, tragic yet romanticized backstories, talking to animals or fantasy elements like wings or animal ears, and perhaps some inspiration from Japanese pop culture, notably anime and manga. Sometimes the characters might also have heterochromia, a rare eye condition. It is by far the most popular subtrope, serving as the core of the stereotype. Some infamous pieces of media that portray the \"quirky\" Mary Sue include Ensign Sue Must Die!, Nyan~ Neko Sugar Girls or the Fanloid character Mikunana Yumene. Inside the fanfiction and digital art communities, these types of traits are criticized because they don't build cohesive characters, and simply collect \"random\" traits without justification rather than creating a deeper personality for the character. Sometimes, when these fictional characters are self-inserts of the author, they might just reflect their desires and likes. The Edgy archetype is mainly associated with pieces of media deemed \"edgy\", such as the Creepypasta, Twilight or Undertale fandoms, among others. The most used color palette is red, black, grey and purple and certain species associated with the trope are vampires, demons, werewolves or killers with supernatural powers. Other common traits are angst and rebelliousness, darkness for darkness' sake, excessive piercings and tattoos, ripped clothing, glowing neon eyes, etc. A Gary Stu is described as a really \"perfect\" male character that everyone in the story really loves, and has exaggerated traits such as being invincible or being the only powerful character in the play. Despite this, this trope seems to receive slightly less criticism and it's not as prevalent as Mary Sues in popular media, likely because of certain gender roles and stereotypes. An Anti-Sue is a character trope that inverts the traits stereotypically associated with Mary Sue characters; while Mary Sues are written to be absolutely perfect and flawless, the Anti-Sue is an heavily flawed character with lots of weaknesses and insecurities[1], and might be portrayed as \"stupid\" or \"repulsive\". These characters tend to be self-inserts, and written by the authors in fear of accidentally creating a \"Mary Sue\" character. However, it's really ironic because such a character still counts as a Mary Sue, since they are still talked about and focused on by all of the other characters in the story, and their characteristics are taken to a harsh extreme. Internet trolls have long exploited the Mary Sue archetype to draw attention on social media and further harm the reputation of the animation meme community. In TVTropes, characters or troll accounts that over-exaggerate the original trope are called Parody Sues[2]. Here's some examples: The Obsessed Fangirl Mary Sue trope became popular in the early and mid-2010s when some users made troll accounts on social media, specifically on YouTube, where they pretended to be the \"biggest fans\" of certain fictional characters, such as Sans from Undertale or Bendy from Bendy And The Ink Machine. These accounts often posted animation memes of their OCs along with their favorite fictional characters, claiming that they belonged only to them. Consequently, this trope gained a lot of infamy at the time, with some users creating \"cringe compilation\" videos specifically featuring Sans fangirls. However, that was their very goal. Also becoming popular in the mid-2010s, some internet trolls made accounts adopting Mary Sue personas and tracing art made by other users on social media, like YouTube or the now defunct Sony Sketch. They tended to screenshot other people's drawings and/or download their animation memes without permission and draw over them to later publish the art without crediting the original authors. This trolling tactic became really infamous in the animation meme community (especially the Spanish-speaking side), in which this practice later came to be known as \"recolor\". The most well-known example of an art tracer who has a Mary Sue persona is a Mexican YouTuber called \"Darkita Kawaii\". She adopted a \"childish\" personality, using really bad grammar on purpose, and trolled the FNAFHS/Five Nights at Freddy's High School (a Mexican webseries inspired by Five Nights At Freddy's) fandom through tracing art and lying about her personal life and various serious issues[3]. Overlapping with the \"Obsessed Fangirl\" trope, she also claimed to be madly in love with Bart from The Simpsons. The account hasn't uploaded anything since 2018, and while no one knows what happened to the person behind Darkita Kawaii, some of her close ex-friends like Mili Cookie argue it was a social experiment. With the rise of the animation meme community during the mid-2010s, the Mary Sue trope quickly became one of the most criticized fictional archetypes of all time with many cringe compilation videos being made on YouTube, as well as troll accounts such as the infamous \"Sans fangirls\". The characters were criticized for being unrealistically perfect, boring and poorly written (such as lacking weaknesses). Others also pointed out how the Mary Sue characters are often created in an attempt to overshadow every other character, and many fanfiction authors may take offense if these characters are criticized. However, there's also pop culture critics who counter-criticized the archetype. Those who popularized the term \"Mary Sue\" received criticism for being potentially sexist, because it plays on certain societal norms like women not being traditionally allowed to have power fantasies. Overpowered male characters in popular media receive less criticism than female ones. Some people argue there's nothing wrong with teenage girls liking Mary Sue characters in the same way it's socially acceptable for boys to enjoy watching superhero movies[4]. Despite the existence of Gary Stu characters as their masculine counterpart, overpowered male characters still receive less criticism, resulting in double-standards. Other similiar phenomena that have been criticized for having misogynistic roots include the \"I'm not like other girls\" debate during the mid-2010s.

It is the polar opposite of Minimalism. \"Wealthy people throughout history have practiced forms of maximalism as ways to showcase their riches-\" Alessandra Wood, VP of Style at interior design service Modsy.[1] Maximalism's beginning is hard to pinpoint for many because it has seemed to have always existed in many forms and styles. Earlier incarnations had wealthy individuals displaying artwork, animal specimens and other goods considered expensive or exotic, in what is equated to a small private museum, to show off to visitors. Maximalism was also a way to create awe in people who entered in churches or cathedrals. This is especially the case for Baroque and Rococo religious architecture. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Catholic Church tried to oppose the Protestant Reformation. Baroque architecture emerged from this Counter Reformation. The Catholic Church in Rome tried to convey its power and emphasize the magnificence of God through reiligious art. Baroque art, design and architecture of the 17th century is known for being extravagant, complex and dramatic. Most ornaments of the Baroque era are inspired by those from Greco-Roman antiquity, and a few originate in the Renaissance. Trompe-l'œil were highly realistic optical illusion paintings of three-dimensional space and objects on a two-dimensional surface. They were used in Italy to decorate church ceilings, so the believers would feel like they are closer to good and heaven. Maximalism continued during the early and mid-18th century too, with the Rococo style. In contrast to the heavy grandeur of Baroque interiors, Rococo salons are lighter and more chill, but still use a big quantity of ornaments. The Victorian era (1837-1901) was a period of revivalism of styles from the past (Neoclassicism, Gothic Revival, Rococo Revival, Renaissance Revival, Egyptian Revival etc), and of eclecticism (the practice of deriving ideas, style, or taste from a broad and diverse range of sources). Designers and architects of the 19th and very early 20th centuries tried to create something new by combining different historical styles into a single design. Eclectic art is like a collage, where elements from different periods and areas are put together. Generally speaking, ecelcticism is one of the key things that leads to overornamentation, aka maximalism. It was a key part of 19th century design and architecture, also due to the fact that artists had access to more materials, technology, chemistry, and sources from more places and periods than ever before. The new museums established during the century were full of them. As said before, revivalism was a big part of Victorian maximalism. For people of the 19th century, style wasn't about individual taste or personal choices. Our present-day idea that this is my, or his or her style barely existed before the last years of the century, and even then it was widely seen as somewhat superficial. The revivals of the Victorian era were of styles of cultures, communities, nations or periods from the past. The objects and buildings of the Victorian era shown in the gallery bellow are without any doubt impressive. Today were are delighted by their ornaments, colours and styles. However, up to the 1960s, with the rise of Postmodernism, when people started to question Modernism and began to appreciate things from the pre-Modern past, the verdict of Victorian designs wasn't good. During the early 20th century and even when they were made, some people described the Victorian age as being one that has been providing us with some of the ugliest objects that have ever been made. Descriptions like 'aesthetic monstrosities' or 'ornamental abominations' were around at the time, and it only got worse. At the end of the 19th century Marc-Louis Solon (1835-1913), a well established ceramic designer, who worked for Minton and Company, was not unusual in commenting that the period 'bears the stamp of an unmitigated bad taste'. As time passed, negative opinions only got worse. Pioneer Mondern architects Adolf Loos and Le Corbusier felt that works like this were not simply bad, they were such an affront they should have been made illegal. \"After the Recession of 2008, design trends turned to minimalist—making a statement with less. As the economy recovered over the next decade, society began accumulating wealth with more disposable income, collecting objects of interest, traveling more, and populating their homes with meaningful and significant art and accessories.\" - Dawn Cook, co-owner of BLDC Design. [2] Today's  maximalism -- also called cluttercore -- may have the same objective as the past incarnations of showing off, but there's a twist. Instead of accruing items to prove you can afford them, modern practitioner use decor and designing fundamentals as a way to express personality and values. Considered an abstract concept in Post Modern Literature, the American Fiction: A-Z, Volume II describes the term The term \"“maximalist fiction,” or maximalism, meanwhile, denotes fictional works, particularly novels, that are unusually long and complex, are digressive in style, and make use of a wide array of literary devices and techniques.\"[4] Maximalist literature lavishes their text with descriptions and information, and borrow from various techniques and genres to tell their story.",

It was coined through a Facebook page in 2016 made by Evan Collins of the Y2K Aesthetics Institute. It is often loosely referred to as \"Y2K fashion\", \"Trashy Y2K\", or simply \"Y2K\" on social media despite its differences from the actual Y2K Futurism aesthetic, though it did have overlap with Y2K (2K1 being a mixture of the two). The first signs of the McBling aesthetic began around the turn of the millennium. It was at this time that the Y2K Futurism aesthetic began to decline and McBling rose following the dot-com bust, 9/11, and the rise of the \"spend, spend, spend\" mentality of the Bush years. Some of the earliest instances of the McBling aesthetic were Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake's denim at the 2001 VMAs, the music video for Madonna's 2000 song \"Music\", and the 2001 film Legally Blonde. In 2002 more trends started appearing such as low-rise jeans, chokers, and bootcut jeans. By 2003 McBling was starting to become more prominent with Eve and Cam'ron's white and pink outfits at the Baby Phat show that fall, Von Dutch trucker hats, and the premiere of Paris Hilton's The Simple Life. This transitional period between Y2K Futurism and McBling is sometimes referred to as the 2K1 aesthetic. The McBling aesthetic went into full swing around late 2004 with the release of the movie Mean Girls, the popularization of Myspace, the popularization of emo via Green Day's American Idiot, the phasing-out of 2K1, the iPod becoming a huge status symbol via Apple's silhouette ad campaign, the premieres of Laguna Beach and Lost, and Gwen Stefani starting her solo career, further hastening the end of the Y2K era. McBling was concurrent or overlapped with a number of other 2000s aesthetics, such as UrBling, Surf Crush, 2K7, and Frutiger Aero. The McBling era ended around 2008–2009 with the Great Recession, Barack Obama's election, and the backlash against 2000s culture setting in. This led into the Electropop 08 era, which lasted from about 2008 to 2013. On social media in recent years, the McBling aesthetic has grown in popularity, albeit it is often referred to as \"Y2K fashion\" or \"Y2K\" despite Y2K originally referring to the futuristic aesthetic predating McBling. The original Y2K is now referred to as Y2K Futurism to differentiate it from McBling and other parts of the Y2K umbrella term. The McBling revival has also been referred to as \"Bubblegum Bling\". Popular visual cues of the era include: People often associate this aesthetic with the color pink (usually a bright hot pink) as it was popularized by Paris Hilton during this time. A darker side to the McBling aesthetic centers around the myriad of celebrity scandals that went down around the time, including: Fashion trends during the McBling era include: The fashion mainly contains messy and controversial outfits worn by celebs during the 2000s, low-rise jeans, Juicy Couture tracksuits, ripped clothes, etc. Popular fashion brands involved in the McBling aesthetic include: Bubblegum Bling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Colors\nBright pink, blue, purple, gold\n\n\nKey Values\nLuxury, futurism\n\n\nRelated Aesthetics\nBoujeeHyperpopNeo-Y2KCherry Emoji Twitter Bubblegum Bling is McBling's revival aesthetic, often mistagged as \"Y2K\" on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, where it is quite popular. This aesthetic emerged in the late 2010s, possibly as part of the Neo-Y2K movement, and has a heavy Hyperpop influence. Like McBling before it, Bubblegum Bling has a focus around luxury and femininity, though it eschews the \"party culture\" aspects in favor of something that is sleeker and more subdued but keeps that stylish, kitschy feel. https://cari.institute/aesthetics/bubblegum-bling Bro Hoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecade of origin\n2000s\n\n\nKey colours\nBlack, grey, red, pink\n\n\nRelated aesthetics\nUrBlingSceneBikerTomboy Bro Hoe is a more sexualized version of the Tomboy aesthetic, described as \"McBling but with more edgy & masculine elements\".

Because of the edgy element to Bro Hoe, there is some crossover with the Scene aesthetic as well, although Bro Hoe doesn't go as over-the-top and alt as Scene does. This style has had a slight revival in recent years due to the 2000s boom online, but the new influencers of it aim to make more available to everyone. Bro Hoe fashion revolves around graphic tees, often from brands such as Ed Hardy, Metal Mulisha, Konflict, Famous, and Affliction, as well as accessories such as bandanas, baseball caps, piercings, and tattoos.

This aesthetic is centered around the cute or artistic side of the aesthetic, and sometimes employs body horror. People who participate in meatcore do not necessarily enjoy eating meat, but they may instead merely enjoy looking at it. While Meatcore may be viewed as a strange or even disgusting aesthetic, it can be aesthetically pleasing and even deeply meaningful to the people that enjoy it. It may help reflect and express a darker side of people, similar to aesthetics like Gorecore. Additionally, because of its focus on flesh and the body it can serve as an expression of the more animalistic side of humanity (quite like Starrflesh). At the end of the day, we are all just meat, and this idea is not necessarily a scary one. For some, it helps reflect the absurdity of human existence. It is also occasionally used in association with body positivity (i.e. the idea we are all the same flesh and blood so there is no need to feel self-conscious). It has also occasionally been connected to themes of Feminism because of the idea that similar to buying and selling livestock for meat, women have historically been bought and sold for their bodies. Meatcore bloggers may share images of meat in supermarket packages; creatures or things made of fresh meat or organs such as the small intestine; characters with extreme mutilations or in situations in which any type of meat is involved. The colors that predominate in aesthetics are intense or dark reds, cream or even reddish pinks. Closeups of meat textures may be used as backgrounds of banners, icons, etc., or used as the pattern of text in image edits. Steak is popular for its appealing marbling. Additionally, motifs of cannibalism may show up in image posts. As meatcore is an obscure aesthetic, fashion is highly individualized. Some ways to include meatcore in one's everyday life include jewelry of meat replicas, such as earrings or necklaces that resemble steak. These are difficult to track down, but can be made oneself. Meatcore fashion may also incorporate motifs of blood, such as blood bags, blood stains or blood drips, or accessories modeled after intestines. Meatcore bloggers enjoy going into the meat aisle at the supermarket or meat/butcher shops and taking pictures to share with their mutuals. Note that they don't necessarily need to buy the meat - taking pictures of it is fair enough. They may also enjoy discussing topics such as cannibalism and body horror. Meatcore is primarily a visual aesthetic, however there are some popular songs which have lyrics that align with its motifs. Generally, meatcore playlists tend to be made up of various popular songs of different sounds that have lyrics relating to meat, blood, cannibalism, or mutilation. Attempts to categorize the sound have been made, which may end up as dark industrial metal or cheery, vintage-sounding songs with dissonant dark lyrics. Honestly, this aesthetic is so niche and visual that one may listen to whatever music they're into and call it fleshcore.",

It is seen most commonly on the websites of both internet and print news sources whenever medical news is presented (but other area of sciences like math, computing and astrophysics may also have it). It can also be seen illustrating science magazines and the cover or editorials of biomedical journals. It usually presents a very slick, digital pseudo-CGI image of organs or cells. It is common to have one element highlighted in a different color. The exact origins and rise of the aesthetics are unclear and require research. Visually, it seems to follow naturally from traditional medical and scientific artificial color imagery and Early Cyber visuals combined with Silicon Dreams 3D aspects. However, the slick, digital look associated with these images wouldn't have been common or easily achieved until at least the mid or late 90s. The need for such imagery exploded in the age of internet social news sharing, specifically the launch of Facebook's Open Graph Protocol in 2010. With these functionally requiring each article to have a header image, thousands of science and general news websites found themselves in need of such images for content that was not easy or outright impossible to illustrate in-house (especially when there were often no in-house photographers to begin with). Although the aesthetic is most prominent in fairly generic pure stock imagery, it shows in the broader realm of biomedical sciences:  covers and illustrations in scientific books, journals and magazines, visuals in documentaries and advertisement, medical tech startup websites, product packaging... Larger businesses in this industry are more likely to stick to actual photographs, though Corporate Memphis is not entirely absent. The design style makes heavy use of a slick 3D style.

Inverted versions of this palette may also be encountered. Pinks, purples, and magentas, although not entirely absent, are rare, usually being featured within gradients. Green is highly unusual within the scheme unless the imagery is referring to plant biology. Particularly common visual hallmarks include: Materials on topic like computing, mathematics, chemistry or astrophysics may be significantly more abstracted.

Medieval England and influences from medieval English history are the most common, but the degree of influence varies wildly, with some Medieval Fantasy borrowing from elements from the Renaissance period, most notably in the style of the weapons and armor used around that time. In recent times there has been an effort to include non-English Medieval influences. Medieval Fantasy fashion, while influenced by styles from medieval times, is not necessarily historically accurate. Polyester stretch velvet, for example, is often used in film and television productions because of its low cost compared to natural silk velvet. Pixel Medieval Fantasy is based around the huge amount of games set in the medieval fantasy genre produced during the 1990s typically featuring Pixel Art.

The medieval period where activities such as jousting, fencing, dancing and adventuring where popular activities given they gave off an aura of excitement to those who were onlookers; one example being many would come to watch jousting events take place however they weren't easily accessible due to most of them taking place in castle grounds and given there was a heavy sense of social hierarchy so to be able to watch one could be said to be something of \"fantasy\". They further provided excitement knowing that someone would die, and also the tension would be high due to a high amount of near misses observed in these jousts as both jousters tended to be highly trained knights or people of combat. The same can go for fencing as well. Dancing was more common throughout everyone in medieval ground as it was performable and required a lack of equipment, it could take place either at balls (portrayed frequently in medieval fantasy media) or in medieval villages/towns/cities and usually consisted of either couple/s dancing together as a sign of romance or marriage or a group of ladies dancing in a circle together in a flowing array of movement to represent grace and the beauty of dance. Of course, men can participate but in Medieval times it was a lot more common for women to dance.

        "description": "This is category for aesthetics that are related to meme culture or have gained meme status online over the years, including aesthetics that contain elements relating to meme culture. Memes are broadly defined as culturally transmitted information or ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another[1]. A key component to the meme concept is that the information is able to self-replicate, and in turn undergoes a type of natural selection, much like biological genes and viruses. The word was coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene (shown below). The book focused on the importance of self-replication in evolution and pointed to the gene as the unit of biological information that is subject to selection pressures. From https://richarddawkins.net/2014/02/whats-in-a-meme/: With the commercialization of the internet in 1995, modern memes gradually became more strongly associated with internet memes. Internet memes are associated with media, catchphrases, and more general trends that spread throughout various outlets on the World Wide Web like chat clients, blogs, social networking sites, email, forums and image boards. They're often used to point out how trends online evolve and change over time, creating various new derivatives.[1] Many people confuse Joke Aesthetics with Meme Aesthetics. A joke aesthetic would be an aesthetic that was created to be funny, non-sensical, annoying, rage-inducing or a parody. Some examples of joke aesthetics would include Massivecockcore or Unliminal Space. Meanwhile a meme aesthetic is an aesthetic originating from meme culture, for example: Black-Holed Memes or Arabfunny.  However, as of 2023, Joke aesthetics are no longer allowed in this wiki, and many of them have been moved to the Joke Aesthetics Wiki.",

It involves bright neon colors, pure geometric shapes, and zig-zagged and squiggly lines. It was created in 1980 by the Italian Memphis Group. The Memphis era was also one of the main inspirations for Vaporwave, Synthwave, and Future Funk. Memphis Design was created in 1980 by the design group Memphis Milano from Milan, Italy. They took their name from the song \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\" by Bob Dylan, which was playing during a meeting. The group designed furniture, with their first Memphis show and catalog both being in 1981. The group disbanded in 1987 due to the initial hype of their movement fading. Although the look for this aesthetic was initially used for furniture, it also expanded into visual art and architecture as well. The Early 1980s had leftover 1970s aesthetics focusing on \"Earth tones\" like brown, beige, and orange, or in the UK where the New Romantic was the dominant aesthetic, but by 1984–85 the Memphis pastels had begun to influence pop culture more widely with the premiere of Miami Vice. However, it was clear that Memphis Design failed to spread beyond piecemeal uses, and the Memphis Group themselves disbanded formally in 1987 due to the lack of commercial interest. Memphis group did however launch interests in multiple directions (e.g. Wacky Pomo, Factory Pomo), especially as it diversified from its original architecture and interior design focus. These various strands eventually coalesced into Memphis Lite, an eclectic aesthetic that came to dominate the memories of much of the late 1980s and early 1990s. While the continuation between pure Memphis design and Memphis Lite is obvious, in practice much retro callbacks to the 80s and 90s refer to Memphis Lite (e.g. Synthwave, Arcadecore etc.). The revival of true Memphis in the 2010s is sometimes referred to as Bougie Design. Memphis Design typically uses brightly colored (typically white) backgrounds plastered with geometric shapes with vibrant colors. Pink, yellow, and blue are the most common colors used for said shapes; the Late 1980s and Early 1990s also marked the addition of purple and teal colors to the palette. Zig-zagged and squiggly lines (usually black) also tend to appear alongside the geometric shapes. While Memphis Design challenged traditional design norms with its bold, primary colors and geometric shape, its almost extremist approach resulted in furniture that was often grotesque, impractical and impossible to design around in an actual average 80s home. Comments have described it as \"a riot of color and materials that often overwhelmed a piece's original intent\"[1] and, discussing its use in Miami Vice, \"telegraph[ing] a clear message: things ain’t right in Miami\".[2] While extremely memorable, Memphis design had relatively minimal impact on consumer products. Its legacy lies more in its influence on later styles and as a precursor to the \"postmodern explosion\" of the late 80s and early nineties, with styles like Wacky Pomo, Factory Pomo, Festival Marketplace, Neoclassical PoMo and Memphis Lite. On the opposite end, actual Memphis design elements are uncommon at best in most revivals that gesture generally toward the 80s and 90s. Synthwave and Vaporwave typically borrows far more heavily from aesthetics like Laser Grid, Pacific Punk Wave (and particularly its neon-colored tropical version) or the far more eclectic Memphis Lite.",

The male equivalent, a merman, are less common in media. They are often associated with storms, shipwrecks, and drowning, however in other mythology they can be benelovent and give gifts or fall in love with humans. The visuals of the mermaid aesthetic are mostly a blue, green, purple, or pearl color scheme. Textures will be smooth, shiny and iridescent, like fish scales. The focus of the mermaid aesthetic is the tail, the shape of the fins often being closer to that of a whale than a fish.

This was synonymous with various brands using cool color palettes in their products. This showed up in drinks, food items, beauty products, accessories, and, of course, slime. Some examples of this style include: Mermaid makeup was popular for festival or costume makeup, a technique using fishnet tights was developed by makeup artists that involved using the tights as a stencil to powder iridescent blue or green onto the side of the face. This would then be accentuated by glitter, sequins or pearlescent beads. The siren aesthetic tends to be a darker version of the mermaid aesthetic, as sirens are more associated with the mythology that they lure sailors to drown. Visuals in this aesthetic may focus more on making the merfolk look inhuman or scary, with bigger scales, claws, shark teeth, fish eyes, or any characteristic associated with deep sea creatures, like translucent skin. The color scheme is dark blues, teals, black, and off-whites. There is overlap in the siren aesthetic with Nautical Fantasy, Dark Nautical and Selkiecore. In traditional mythology, Sirens are half bird women rather than half fish, so this may also be portrayed.

Heavy metal was the culmination of the Acid rock heard in the late 1960s - a genre that describes the heavier sounding psychedelic rock first played by various bands of the San Francisco music scene. Metal music is easy to notice; loud guitars, fast drumming and violent lyrics generally being the main components. Bands credited for the start of metal range from the heavy blues of Led Zeppelin, Blue Cheer, and Jimi Hendrix, to the occult rock stylings of Coven and Blue Öyster Cult, and on to the likes of Alice Cooper, Pentagram and Black Sabbath. Bands like MC5 and The Stooges were also crucial in presaging the hardening of rock music into both punk and metal styles. The 1970s and early 80s brought the \"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\", while various bands from the United States and continental Europe solidified some of the first subgenres - notably Doom metal and Power metal, as well as the popular and prolific Thrash metal scene. This sonic and subcultural diversification under the \"heavy metal\" umbrella would, notably, continue into the first decade of the 21st century. Because of the aggressive sound, it became cause for panic by Christian parents, who believed the music to be Satanic and a bad influence for children during the 80s. Despite the pushback, metal is still popular in many facets of music, influencing genres such as Grunge, Nu-metal and Rap metal among many, many other subgenres and microgenres. Fans of metal are called headbangers or metalheads. While some metalheads may introduce some variety into their musical tastes, the vast majority of their musical diet is heavy metal. This is also music that a lot of people involved in bodybuilding will listen to while working out to keep them motivated and pushing their bodies beyond their known limits to sculpt their bodies in the desired way (be they Mass Monster or Classic bodybuilders), which can lead to a lot of crossover between the Bodybuilder and the Metalhead (and sometimes a combination of the two, which can cut an imposing silhouette). Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that \ndeveloped in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in Blues rock, Psychedelic rock, and Acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, \ncharacterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, \nemphatic beats, and overall loudness. The genre's lyrics and performance\n styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. Main Article: Black Metal Black Metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms\n. Main Article: Death Metal Death Metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal.\nIt typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played \nwith techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, \ndeep growling vocals, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double \nkick and blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, \nkey, and time signature changes, and chromatic chord progressions. The \nlyrical themes of death metal may include slasher film-style violence, \npolitical conflict, religion, nature, philosophy, and science fiction. Thrash Metal is a subgenre of heavy metal characterized by fast percussive beats, low-register rhythm guitar riffs, and shredding lead guitars. Thrash Metal originates from the early 80's taking influence from Traditional Heavy Metal and Hardcore Punk as a counter-movement to the rise of Hair Metal in the mainstream music industry. Much like Hardcore Punk, lyrical themes of Thrash Metal often include criticism of the establishment, concern for environmental destruction, and disdain for Christian dogma. Thrash Metal bands include Slayer, (early) Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Testament, and Obituary. Deathgrind (sometimes written as death-grind or death/grind) is a shorthand term that is used to describe bands who play a fusion of death metal and  grindcore. Drone Metal (or drone doom), is a style of heavy metal that melds the slow tempos and heaviness of doom metal with the long-duration tones of drone music. Funk Metal is a fusion genre of funk rock and \nalternative metal which infuses heavy metal music (often thrash metal) \nwith elements of funk and punk rock. It was popular in the mainstream \nduring the late 1980s and early 1990s, as part of the \nalternative metal movement. Folk Metal A fusion of heavy metal with various styles of folk music from around the world. Glam Metal, also known as Hair Metal was a genre that emerged from Los Angeles in the mid-late 1980s, having a basis in hard rock and heavy metal with inspirations from pop.  Glam Metal has a unique and exaggerated upbeat tone in music and fashion. Bands such as Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Van Halen, L.A. Guns, W.A.S.P., and Faster Pussycat lead the genre at the time. Grindcore is an extreme fusion genre of heavy metal and hardcore punk that originated in the mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from abrasive-sounding musical styles, such as: thrashcore, crust punk, hardcore punk, extreme metal, and industrial. Groove Metal (also known as post-thrash or neo-thrash) is a subgenre of heavy metal music. Music journalists and fans have used groove metal to describe Pantera, Exhorder and Machine Head. At its core, groove metal takes the intensity and sonic qualities of thrash metal and plays them at mid-tempo, with most bands making only occasional forays into fast tempo. There is often a crossover with Southern Rock - the genre is heavily associated with Confederate symbology, the city of New Orleans (where the closely related genre of Sludge Metal is hugely prominent), and the state of Texas. Goregrind is a fusion genre of grindcore and death metal. British band Carcass are commonly credited for the emergence of the genre. It is recognized for its heavily edited, pitch shifted \"watery\"-sounding vocals and abrasive musicianship rooted in grindcore. Gothic metal is a hybrid genre that combines gothic rock with heavy metal. Melodic Black Metal (also known as blackened melodic death metal or melodic blackened death metal) is a genre of extreme metal that describes the style created when melodic death metal bands began being inspired by black metal and European romanticism. However, unlike most other black metal, this take on the genre would incorporate an increased sense of melody and narrative. Melodic Death Metal (also referred to as melodeath) is a subgenre\n of death metal that employs highly melodic guitar riffs, often \nborrowing from traditional heavy metal. Power Metal is a subgenre of metal that focuses on grandiose instrumentals and clean, powerful vocals. Lyrical content can vary, but many bands tend to focus on either war or medieval fantasy. Progressive Metal (or prog metal) is a fusion genre melding \nheavy metal and progressive rock that combines the loud \"aggression\" and\n amplified guitar-driven sound of the former with the more experimental,\n cerebral or \"pseudo-classical\" compositions of the latter. A subgenre of Progressive Metal, Djent, is made distinct by a high-gain, distorted, palm-muted, low-pitch guitar sound. The name \"Djent\" is an onomatopoeia of this sound. Basically metal mixed with symphonic elemets like violins. Usually you got that one chick that used to sing opera or was in the choir as your main vocalist. topics are usually about dragons or chasing your destiny and have fantasy elements Unblack Metal is a religious philosophy within black metal whose \nartists are either directly against the Satanism prevalent in black \nmetal, or promote Christianity in their lyrics and imagery. War Metal (also known as war black metal or bestial black \nmetal) is an aggressive, cacophonous and chaotic subgenre of blackened \ndeath metal, described by Rock Hard journalist Wolf-Rüdiger \nMühlmann as \"rabid\" and \"hammering\". Important influences include first \nwave black metal band Sodom,first wave black metal/death metal band Possessed as well as old grindcore, black and death metal bands like Repulsion, Autopsy, Sarcófago and the first two Sepultura releases. War metal bands include Blasphemy, Archgoat, Impiety, In Battle, Beherit, Bestial Warlust and Zyklon-B. Main Article: Nu-Metal Nu metal (sometimes stylized as nü-metal) is a subgenre of alternative metal that combines elements of heavy metal music with elements of other music genres such as hip hop, alternative rock, funk, industrial, and grunge. fashion tends to be really simple; t-shirts in support of their favorite band (or bands), simple jeans, boots or sneakers, and possibly a leather jacket. Both male and female metalheads have a tendency to also keep their hair long with male metalheads growing massive facial hair (and, if they don't keep their hair long, they'll shave it all off). In modern days, it's not unusual for metalheads to be covered in piercings and tattoos as well (some will also dye their hair unnatural colors), but the core Metalhead fashion remains. When you get into the Black Metal end of the Metalhead spectrum, they'll take the aesthetic to a brand new level; often appearing dressed in black with combat boots, bullet belts, spiked wristbands and inverted crosses and inverted pentagrams to reinforce their anti-Christian or anti-religious stance. However, the most stand-out trait is their use of corpse paint—black and white face paint sometimes mixed with real or fake blood, which is used to create a corpse-like or demonic appearance. Another key factor of Metalhead culture is the art of crafting a \"battle jacket\" (sometimes referred to as a \"cut-off\" if the sleeves have been removed. Some may choose to leave the sleeves on, but this is not common). This involves buying a denim/leather jacket (though other articles of clothing have been known to be decorated in this fashion) and covering it in various patches of different band logos, albums, and motifs. Some Metalheads will make an effort to buy their patches directly from the bands, whether that be at a concert merch table or at an officially licensed online shop to support the bands. Alternatively, some may choose to hand paint or sew their patches, or just buy them from random retailers. These choices are entirely dependent on the person.",

Among other styles blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages conducive to moshing. The first bands to make music in this style were Integrity and the New York Hardcore bands in the late 1980s alongside the birth of the metal subgenre, Thrash. Other defining instrumentation includes heavy guitar riffs and occasional blast beats. Vocalists in the genre typically apply fry scream techniques, alongside lower growls. Some later metalcore bands often combine this with the use of clean singing, with the singing often happening during the chorus of the song. Some late 2010's bands have also incorporated virtuosic guitar riffs, some notable bands that do this are Oceans Ate Alaska and ERRA. For the majority, Metalcore fashion choices come from casual wear such as skinny denim pants, band T-shirts, and skater shoes. Band shirts have various art styles; the early metalcore bands had artwork influenced by New York Hardcore, Youth Crew, urban street, and dark crusty styles. The mid-2010s brought a big change to Metalcore fashion, with many bands incorporating t-shirt designs with minimalistic imagery, often inspired by streetwear fashion, alongside iconic band logos. Under Construction Early bands in the sound style of Metalcore were Integrity and Earth Crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the late 1990s and early 2000s gave rise to bands As I Lay Dying, Hatebreed, Unearth, and Throwdown. Melodic metalcore is a fusion genre, incorporating elements of melodic death metal and metalcore, with a heavy emphasis on melodic instrumentation, distorted guitar tones, palm muting, double bass drumming, blast beats, metalcore-stylized breakdowns, aggressive screaming, death growls, and clean singing. Many bands in this style took influences from Swedish melodic death metal band At The Gates and combined it with the influences of 90s hardcore. Deathcore is a fusion genre combining Brutal or Slam Death Metal, a minor influence from grindcore, blended in with Metalcore. This style focuses a heavy emphasis on the brutal vocals implementing the guttural death growls, screams, and \"pig squeals\". The instrumental structures emphasizes more on the rhythmic grooves and heavy breakdowns while maintaining most of the structures used stylistically in Metalcore: Under Construction",

Metalheart emerged during the Y2K Futurism era of the late 1990s, replacing older Cyberpunk aesthetics such as Early Cyber and Cyberdelic.

Metalheart was named after Andreas Lindholm's 2001 book of the same title. This aesthetic peaked in popularity in the Early 2000s and later became oversaturated by the Mid 2000s. After that, it was morphed into McBling/Frutiger Metro/UrBling vector graphics and was replaced by Hipness Purgatory. The visuals consist of deformed abstract shapes, that can be either 3D with metallic and chrome textures or 2D with geometric flat shapes, as well as futurist UIs, that contain minimalist iconography, abstract lines and lights, grids, coding text, and futuristic fonts.

Midwest Emo is a sub-genre of emo music that began in the 1990s as a response to the Washington, D.C. emotional hardcore scene, such as Rites of Spring, Moss Icon, and Embrace. Key traits of the genre include emotional and unconventional vocal deliveries, personal and introspective lyrics, and “twinkly” arpeggiated guitar melodies. Bands such as Sunny Day Real Estate, Cap'n Jazz, Mineral, Braid, Christie Front Drive, and The Promise Ring introduced indie/math rock-inspired elements to the D.C. emo-core sound to polish its more abrasive components into a unique style that, while more accessible, maintained its introspective and expressive roots. A key difference between the scenes is that Midwest emo bands prioritized melodic riffs and vocal lines over the furious, punk sensibilities of the emo-core bands they succeeded. Midwest emo experienced a slight rise in popularity within DIY movements across the United States throughout the 90s, with notable scenes in the Midwest (Cap’n Jazz, The Promise Ring, American Football, Braid), Texas (Mineral, At the Drive-In, The Gloria Record), the Pacific Northwest (Sunny Day Real Estate, Pedro the Lion), and the East Coast (Texas Is the Reason, Jawbreaker, Rainer Maria, The Jazz June, Penfold). Because of the notable stylistic changes of the emo genre over time, this period is often referred to as the second wave of emo. The low-budget, DIY roots of the genre heavily influence both the music and aesthetic of Midwest emo. This manifests in several ways: raw emotional delivery takes precedence over production quality, audiences formed through word-of mouth rather than label promotion, and fashion was decidedly uninspired, favoring comfort and accessibility over artistic expression—which was largely relegated to the music itself. With the decline of grunge in the late 90s, the future of the alternative rock landscape was uncertain. Bands across the subgenera of alternative rock (such as pop-punk, nu-metal, and post-grunge) found themselves competing for label attention, and though Midwest emo acts such as Texas Is the Reason and The Get Up Kids received considerable exposure on MTV, it was unclear whether any of them could sign to a major record label and propel the Midwest sound into the mainstream. By the early 2000s, it became clear that labels favored more accessible, pop-influenced emo acts such as Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday, and Jimmy Eat World. These bands have been described as \"mall emo,\" emo-pop, and, debatably, the third wave of emo. Following the massive commercial reach of these emo-pop bands and the continued success of pop-punk acts like Blink-182 and Green Day, it seemed that Midwest emo was all but forgotten. Midweste emo experienced a resurgence in the early 2010s in a period which came to be known as the \"Midwest emo revival,\" or the fourth wave of emo. Bands such as Algernon Cadwallader, Street Smart Cyclist, Snowing, Into It. Over It., Empire! Empire! (I Was A Lonely Estate), Everyone Everywhere, Brave Little Abacus, and CSTVT (formerly Castevet), Merchant Ships were greatly influenced by the Midwest emo acts of the 90s. Emo revival bands utilized \"twinkly\" math-rock-esque riffs even more often than their predecessors, and while relationship issues remained a common theme, revival acts also more often utilized surrealist imagery and lyrics, not unlike those written by Cap'n Jazz over a decade prior. Bands of the revival often used extended chords and brass instrumentation, which had previously been characteristic of bands like American Football, to further enhance the  \"jazzy\" qualities of their songs. The Midwest emo revival quickly diversified in the following years, with bands pulling influence from a broad swath of genera. Pop-punk and punk influence found their way into the revival on the backs of acts including Title Fight, Dikembe, Joyce Manor, The Hotelier, You Blew It!, Citizen, Glocca Morra, and Free Throw. Indie music also had considerable influence on the revival. Examples of bands that straddle the border of indie and emo include Tigers Jaw, Modern Baseball, Marietta, Sorority Noise, Microwave, and Foxing. Bands such as Brave Little Abacus and The World Is A Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid To Die fused Midwest emo with post-rock elements such as texture/timbre experimentation and the implementation of electronic instruments. Bands such as I Kill Giants, Tiny Moving Parts, This Town Needs Guns, and Colour wore their math rock influence on their sleeves. Common tropes within the Midwest emo aesthetic include suburban living, sports themes, skate culture, recreational drug usage, friendship, and failed romances. Historically, midwest emo style has functioned similarly to norm-core fashion in that comfortable, conservative styles of dress are more common than outright experimentation. Midwest style is unfashionable and inoffensive by design. Blue jeans and chinos are the most common bottoms within this style. Touring musicians will often wear khaki shorts or even basketball shorts to maximize comfort while traveling and performing. Plaid and tartan design shirts are Midwest emo essentials, and will typically be on flannel or madras cloth. These can be worn unbuttoned revealing a plain t-shirt or graphic tee, or buttoned, though rarely will they be tucked. Polo shirts in plain colors or patterns are often worn, and plain t-shirts essential, and are actually more likely to be tucked than button-down shirts. Hoodies and sweaters are especially common in the literal Midwest. The most common accessories include headwear such as dad hats, beanies, and baseball caps. Glasses, if prescribed, are typically worn rather than contact lenses. Sneakers and casual boots are the most common footwear options for this style. Converse, Vans, and New Balance sneakers in white or black are most often seen, though checkered vans and athletic shoes are not uncommon. Low-top and high-top variants are equally acceptable, and pants will often be cuffed. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

While Military wear has also been popular among among self-proclaimed patriots with nationalistic ideals, many into the aesthetic simply enjoy its looks. The flip side of Military aesthetic is Paramilitary, also known as SWATcore, SWATpunk etc. This is not exactly a form of Military aesthetic but similar in a nutshell and is found in LE agencies, security guards and various government agencies, SWAT teams the most common. The military aesthetic is related to the Japanese gakuran, a male school uniform adopted from European military uniforms. Games that have the military aesthetic are primarily FPS (First-Person Shooters) or war simulators, but some strategy games are also related. Military music typically includes marches and songs related to a country or its military, such as national anthems. However, music can have military themes without being explicitly related to a country. There's more to this than nationalism. For example, songs that focus on life in the military or war would fit this aesthetic. A Rambo character is a lone wolf who acts recklessly. The name originated from the 1982 movie First Blood where a character named John Rambo fights tons of enemies on his own. The aesthetics typically feature the character, usually topless/wearing a vest (female rambo characters with camouflage bikinis etc) holding a heavy weapon while wearing a belt of bullets across his/her chest. Revolution specifically focuses on the buildup to a revolution, typically one that involves the military. Nationalism and a desire for change are particularly important for this subgenre. In terms of aesthetics, the Revolution subgenre generally consists of two main factions with contrasting factions; the rebels, or otherwise the party that is attempting to overthrow or usurp the power of the second faction; the government- or another entity with supreme authority, in some cases represented by a monolithic corporation or even a larger rebel group encompassing that of the protagonist. The rebel faction will typically dress its 'soldiers' haphazardly and as such most of the rebels themselves will be wearing clothing and gear resembling that worn by civilians, with actual military equipment such as ammo pouches, webbing, helmets or field caps issued inconsistently amongst their ranks. In terms of appearances, rebels thus only vaguely, if at all, resemble foot soldiers of a contemporary military. The rebels that appear in the 2008 rendition of 'Rambo' appear to demonstrate most of the aesthetic trends used by 'rebel' factions in media quite well. Of the column of rebels visible in the image shown above, none wear a distinctive military uniform- though some are equipped with magazine pouches visible across their torso, best seen on the soldiers with a yellow and blue bandana respectively in the centre-right of the image. The lack of proper military uniform (and thus the rebels' close resemblance to their respective civilian population) in media is often used to implicitly reflect the rebel faction's values; which is typically, in most films, including but not limited to things like individualism, liberty, and equity for the people being oppressed or misrepresented by the regime they aim to dispose of. However, not all rebel groups represented in film are shown as an ununiformed civilian force. Whenever rebel factions are given a uniform, such is usually done for the sake of military or historical accuracy, as most notable revolutionary armies in real life have typically used some sort of uniform to distinguish themselves from civilians in conventional battles. A common option is to simply give the rebel soldiers matching items such as an armband, piece of headgear, or patch with insignia of the rebel army on it. Such is shown once again in the 2008 'Rambo', in which one scene displays a rebel in a black outfit with the patch of the Karen National Liberation Army on their shoulder. Surprisingly, the government faction of this subgenre has even more varied aesthetics between different pieces of media than that of their rebel counterparts. While the 'rebel' outfit is generally quite homogenous and can be reasonably generalized as civilian clothing with occasional pragmatic use of military equipment, the 'government' soldiers' outfit can vary massively depending on minute details of the media they are presented in. If based in present, historical, or certain 'alternate reality' settings, the regime's army can be placed into one of two categories. The first and most common is when the film is set in a developing country that has been taken over by a dictatorship or other authoritarian regime, in which case the government's army- while still making use of standardized uniforms and equipment- will be notably underequipped with outdated weapons, vehicles and infantry gear that makes the individual soldier notably less effective in combat. Being specific, this usually means the soldiers may: It is likely that the soldiers of the antagonizing government are given ineffective equipment to represent how they are effectively used as 'pawns' by a regime that ultimately does not care about them; reinforcing the anti-individualist ethos valued by the regime that is usually part of the inspiration for the rebellion they are fighting to suppress. The regime soldiers' matching uniforms that make them appear alike, when contrasted with the haphazard outfits of the rebels that differs with each fighter contributes to the main motif typically used in the Revolution subgenre; individualism and liberty vs authoritarian collectivism. The second, less prevalent category is when the film is set in a developed (or at least wealthy) country where the government's army actually appears very modern in terms of equipment and discipline. However, this generally doesn't prevent them from falling into the 'Redshirt Army' trope as the former category does, and as such its soldiers are just as likely to be murdered en masse during the action scenes in spite of their seemingly better standing. The soldiers of this army can be characterized as the opposite to that of the former on all the points discussed above barring incompetence and discipline. In media where the government's soldiers are given effective equipment, it can be inferred that such is done to make them appear like a much more threatening opponent to the rebellion, or may reflect the overwhelming authority enforced by the regime upon its people. This is all in spite of the trend of such armies proving extremely incompetent when in combat with the media's protagonists or their rebel counterpart, in which, as can be seen in the images provided, the soldiers do not appear to follow any sort of decentralized command structure (squads of soldiers separate from each other and lead by sergeants, etc.) However, it is entirely possible that this is done out of unintended ignorance of such command structures in real life, as opposed to an intention to portray the army in question as incompetent or disorganized. After the War specifically focuses on the impact of war, particularly on members of the military. Disillusionment is a common theme.

It was named after the ROBLOX game Mind Murder Place. Mind Murder visuals usually have a cartoon or video game character (e.g. The Boyfriend from Friday Night Funkin' or the animation YouTuber Shgurr) accompanied by trippy visuals and a quote. Some examples of Mind Murder quotes are “It's about the worst thing I can imagine... losing who you are like that, all the while being twisted into a damned monster.\",  “I don't know who I am. I am always living as someone else for my assignments. I don't remember what my face looks like ... or even what my personality was like. My face, memories, personality, beliefs, emotions, and soul ... I left them all behind. I have no ... 'self'. I am no one. I am nothing but an endless abyss.\", and  “I don't know. I'm losing it. It's losing me. It's going away.”. Although transformation art and trippy art has been around for a very long time, this aesthetic only started recently for its time. On March 31st, 2019, Desmarce uploaded the game MIND MURDER PLACE to Roblox. On September 19th. 2020, AussieBianca uploaded her first drawing to art sharing platform DeviantArt, which is titled “Bianca Kitty”. Graceorwhatever, who has a big hand in creating the aesthetic, joined DeviantArt in March of 2021. 2 months later on May 21st, 2021, Bianca uploaded the very first example of Mind Murder, which is a non-glitchy, psychedelic, trippy, picture of Cassandra from the Newgrounds game Pico's School turning into Carol from the Friday Night Funkin' mod titled Vs. Carol. The next day, Clone By Conversion created their Tumblr, in which they occasionally posted aesthetic photos; however, their blog has ended. Mind Murder fashion is mainly based off of mixing random clothes together. It usually consists of: Mind Murder aesthetic music, similar to DarkErrorcore, is meant to sound glitchy and invoke fear and anxiety. Whether it’s rock or electronic music, Mind Murder music still invokes the sense of anxiety and sadness. Heavy, angsty sounds with disturbing lyrics are often the type of music in this aesthetic. Electronic elements can also be implemented into the heavier part of this aesthetic. Many people think Mind Murder is aestheticizing a fetish due to the use of TF art in the community, some of it even being slightly NSFW. Artists also don’t like their art being stolen. As a result, some Mind Murder artists, like AussieBianca have used their own art for the aesthetic, for example, the crying smiley face was drawn by Clone By Conversion herself.

It has had a widespread influence, ranging from the arts to lifestyle. As an art movement, Minimalism began in post-WWII Western art, and was most prominent in the 1960s through the early 1970s. It is strongly influenced from the reductive aspects associated with some parts of Modernism, including Suprematism, Purism, and De Stijl. The art movement has had a significant influence on Minimalism as a lifestyle, which is a rejection of consumerist trends with an emphasis on simple living. This lifestyle has become increasingly prominent since 2010, and is commonly associated with The Minimalists. For most history, Maximalism was mainstream for high end art, design and architecture. At the same time, peasants and most of the population which wasn't part of the elite owned simple objects and lived in basic homes, which to our eyes of today might look 'Minimalistic'. Aside from financial factors, across time, in some circumstances minimalism occurred before Modernism. Probably the most famous case is the one of Ancient Egyptian pyramids. Both their exteriors and interiors were simplistic. In the case of the Pyramids of Giza, they were initially covered in a layer of smooth white limestone, and their tops were covered in gold. What we see today is the core structure, since the surface polished limestone layer was used to build the city of Cairo during the Middle Ages. Another form of ancient Minimalism was the exterior of Byzantine buildings, especially churches. Because Christian liturgies are held in the interior of the churches, Byzantine exteriors usually have little if any ornamentation. Still produced today, admired and collected by many Minimalists are simple Japanese ceramics. Across time, both sophisticated highly decorated porcelain and simple everyday ware were produced in Japan. These simple Japanese pots, coloured in earthy tones, inspired many Art Nouveau ceramists and glass makers during the 1890s and the 1900s. Precisionism was an art movement in the United States after World War I and it also incorporated design principles that would be popular later on with Minimalism, such as depicting the world in a reduced and minimal form. Minimalism refers to a lack of clutter. This means that visuals tend to be very simple and remove unnecessary details. Solid colors are very common. Simple patterns may also appear; anything that is complex will not. Colors also tend to be very muted. Minimal fashion is simple and quiet and doesn't have bold and bright colours like other aesthetics.

As the name implies, it blends elements of the Indie aesthetic along with the otherwise Minimalist aesthetics. The color palette is usually based around white, black, navy, and light gray or blue, with one or two bright accents. Also, the minimalism side is heavily influenced by the bright colors and clean lines of Bauhaus and Modernist design. Indie style means basically just whatever feels right based on your personal aesthetic, and usually involves avoiding mainstream labels. Minimalism is just what it sounds like: a little. This often means a spare, neutral palette, clean lines, and a focus on function and practicality first. So, indie minimalism is a combination of these styles, usually involving basics like a white button-down shirt or jeans outfits with one or two distinctive touches of color. You can get inspiration from urban street-style (as long as you are dressing for yourself rather than to show off to others) or find clothes in thrift shops and vintage stores if you like to shop.

It places an emphasis on ritualized experience, sensory attentiveness, and tranquility.  It can be described as clean, light, simple, functional, and minimal. Matcha often employs the use of a single muted color, or a muted color palette, against a white or black backdrop. Common materials include brushed metal, wood, paper, matte plastic, cork, felt, and ceramic. Matcha design encourages sensory specificity as a means to turning daily experiences into pleasing rituals. Accordingly, it overlaps with some vintage technologies whose daily usage conjures sounds, smells, and textures (eg. vinyl record albums, cassette tapes, mechanical typewriters, and paper stationery). Typographic elements are carefully crafted in Matcha design, and often feature as part of, rather than simply accessory to, the overall design of an object. Matcha draws from the simplicity of minimalism, but places an added emphasis on sensory delight. While it shares some elements with Comfy/Cozy, including a ritualized ease in daily activities, it is not confined to a set of behaviors. Similarly, it overlaps with the warmth of Coffee House, but with an added emphasis on the experience of objects in themselves, and not simply as part of a larger environment. Technozen is a subcategory of it, which is associated with with Mid 2000s music and technology and has a more restrictive color palette. [plagiarized] Critics argue that minimalist spaces can sometimes feel cold, sterile, and devoid of personal expression. The emphasis on clean lines and neutral colors may result in an environment that lacks warmth and character, leading to an impersonal and unwelcoming atmosphere. In some cases, minimalism may prioritize aesthetics over functionality. By reducing possessions and focusing on simplicity, minimalism may overlook the practical needs and preferences of individuals. This can result in sacrificing comfort, convenience, and personal enjoyment in the pursuit of an idealized minimalist lifestyle. Minimalism's emphasis on decluttering and detachment from material possessions can be seen as a detachment from emotional attachments as well. Critics argue that sentimental objects and personal belongings play a significant role in our lives, connecting us to memories and experiences. By minimizing the importance of these items, minimalism may overlook the emotional value they hold for individuals. These are Youtubers who frequently talk about minimalism and related topics.",

It would go on to become a mainstream aesthetic in popular culture from the late 1990s to mid-2000s, succeeding the Global Village Coffeehouse aesthetic. This aesthetic is named for the Mission District located in San Francisco, California where a collection of artists, many being graduates from the San Francisco Art Institute, lived. These artists started the style in the early 1990s by creating graffiti and murals around the district, influenced by neo-expressionist artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, and also having overlap with Los Angeles's Lowbrow/Pop Surrealism movement. Mission School grew in popularity continuing into the mid-1990s, bursting on the pop culture scene with the release of OK Soda in 1993. Mission School peaked in mainstream popularity from the late 1990s to mid-2000s, somewhat replacing Global Village Coffeehouse as the preferred marketing look for industries such as Starbucks (though traces of GVC design continued into the 2000s). Mission School's influence could also be seen in television of the time, such as Mission Hill, Clone High, and A Kitty Bobo Show. Mission School is noted for its muted colors, faux-weathered textures, and influence from the UPA/midcentury revival that was popular at the time (i.e. Mission Hill). Common mediums include collages, graffiti, and murals. This aesthetics has been described as difficult to pin down, with examples often being disparate in style.

Its mood is largely pessimistic, with cold tones, slouchy clothing, and an association with Otaku culture. It also incorporates Kawaii elements, especially with mascots and girly fashion. Western fans had mistakenly referred to the 2020s revival of Mizuiro as Tenshi Kaiwai (天使界隈, Angel Community); this is actually the community hashtag of the Tenshi Zyoshi magazine/blog that featured the aesthetic, not the aesthetic itself. It is also sometimes misspelled as Tenshi Kawaii, which is meaningless. The community for this aesthetic creates content on Instagram and TikTok, which you can find by searching 水色界隈 (mizuiro community), 水色サブカル (mizuiro subculture), and 水色雰囲気 (mizuiro aesthetic). Before it was given any name, the aesthetic was mostly associated with Ano from the now distinct Japanese idol group You'll Melt More! as well as her fans during the mid-to-late 2010s. As the \"light blue\" member of the group, she was mainly known for being a social outcast and her customized tracksuits, both of which are still a recurring theme in the aesthetic to this today. In 2020, due to a tracksuit boom, a renewed interest in the aesthetic occured, causing a new peak in its popularity. Most images in this aesthetic have been edited to be cooler toned, with a bluish-gray hue over the image. The colors in this aesthetic always include light blue (hence the name) and white. Black and silver are other common colors. Pink may show through because of the popular trend of excess blush makeup and its ubiquity in Kawaii merchandise. Some mizuiro visuals incorporate cyber/webcore visuals from the 90s or 2000s to early 2010s, with low-poly computer generated imagery, old web design and fonts, and Web 1.0 internet UIs. Cute, minimalistic illustrations are also a popular motif in this aesthetic and very reminiscent of wabi-sabi with their wobbly outlines and unpolished look. They usually feature original characters created for purely aesthetic reasons rather than a story. However, characters from specific anime and franchises may be featured too. People in this aesthetic may own figurines, posters, and various other merchandise centered around these characters, similar to Kawaii Gamer. A common character is Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis Evangelion, as well as Hachiware from Chiikawa, and the de facto mascot is Sanrio's Cinnamoroll. What all these characters  have in common is that white and blue are their main colors, which explains their popularity in the mizuiro community. The locations many images take place in also reflect an Otaku lifestyle. Many photos often take place in arcades and gamer set-ups. The photos also often have an industrial edge to them, as many photos were taken in city streets and parking garages, with concrete and steel being common in the background. While the aesthetic covers a wide range of styles, there is a few elements that are characteristic of mizuiro fashion. This fashion style mainly consists a blue color scheme, usually with hints of sportiness or techwear influences like tracksuits, hoodies, etc. Sometimes flared leg warmers are included. Usually features kawaii imagery or a general soft feel, and is paired with old web aesthetics. Written as ジャージメイド in Japanese, the jersey maid style is a fashion style that utilizes tracksuits (commonly called jerseys in Japan) with maid-like details, such as ruffles and lace. Outfits consisting of an oversized tracksuit worn in combination with a maid headdress and apron are the most common, but there's also many clothes specifically made with the style in mind that can often resemble Girly and Lolita fashion. lf. Content creators on TikTok often create videos of them wearing the light blue outfits and dancing to fast-paced electronic dance music or VOCALOID music. Commonly, these people cover up their face with stickers or use filters. Like in other fashion-centered TikTok communities, there are also many videos where people following the aesthetic show off their latest hauls, introduce their favorite brands, or recommend specific products and where to get them.

During the last years of the 19th century, new art trends surged in Europe, and most of them rejected traditionalist art values, as they were seen as restrictive and outdated. Even though at first Modernisme was part of one of those European trends, Art Nouveau, it actually developed a really unique style and became one of the most original and developed Modernist movements. Modernisme was highly influential in southwestern Europe and is known for its colorful architecture, as well as for some of the most important monuments of Europe, such as the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. Architects such as Antoni Gaudí, Lluís Domènech i Montaner, and Josep Puig i Cadafalch and many more artists played an important place on shaping the architectural style of Modernisme. These artists started using new techniques, materials, and forms of expression that hadn't be tried yet to promote innovation and Avant-garde styles. Along with that, the idea of Gesamtkunstwerk was also promoted, which refers to adopting influence from many other art movements as means to collaborate with them and their artists. Some styles that influenced Modernisme are Art Nouveau, Symbolism and the Arts and Crafts Movement. Intellectual authors and artists who belonged to this movement also fought for the promotion of the Catalan culture and language, as well as regional autonomy, as part of the Renaixença movement in Catalonia, so the style also played a major role on the modernization of the Catalan cultural identity. Due to the Industrial Revolution, during the 19th century, various artistic movements surged throughout Europe which rejected traditional art values. Many international architects and artists wanted to incorporate inspiration from what they thought the 20th century could be like, and they started to highly value aesthetics.  \nThe birth of Modernisme could be interpreted as one of the many regional varieties of the Modernist art movement, which included similiar European movements like Art Nouveau, Secession Art, Jugendstil, etc. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Modernisme began to take shape as its own distinct artistic movement. Many Catalan artists and architects, such as Antoni Gaudí, Lluís Domènech i Montaner, and Josep Puig i Cadafalch, began to experiment with new forms of art that blended traditional Catalan styles with influences from the Modernist movement from Europe itself, quickly gaining its own charm. Although there were many architects and artists in this movement, Gaudí's works have become almost synonymous with it. His works can be found all over Barcelona and have become some of the most important masterpieces of Modernisme. Despite its popularity and important influence, Modernisme declined in the early 20th century due to various factors. During the 1910s, the Catalan bourgeoisie adopted the style, and after that, Modernisme slowly became a fad. The political situation in Spain also changed. Due to the movement's intentions of incorporating traditional Catalan elements into modern art, the Spanish right wing political factions saw Modernisme as a symbol of Catalan nationalism, and therefore the style was supressed and replaced by conservative styles like Noucentisme, which had been trying to challenge its popularity and progressist ideas for years. The 13th of September of 1923, General Miguel Primo de Rivera started a coup d'etat in Spain, ultimately serving as the dictator of Spain from 1923 to 1930. Rivera's militar dictatorship targeted Catalan intellectuals due to their ideas, and even declared illegal the usage of the Catalan language in public. This obviously affected Modernisme due to its original intentions; for example, Gaudí felt a deep connection to the Catalan language, and continued speaking it regardless of the law. Many other architects of the Modernisme movement shared similiar sentiments, and this brought negative consequences to them, such as imprisonent or violence.  \nHowever, during the 1930s, Modernisme had a resurgence during the Second Spanish Republic, however it's not well known how related the 1930s Catalan art was to the Modernisme movement itself, because the artists weren't actually intending to continue any past tradition, and even then, its dissapareance quickly became unevitable because in 1936 the nation of Spain would be met with a Civil War and Francisco Franco's dictatorship in 1939, which also supressed the Catalan culture. The architecture itself lasted slightly longer than the entirity of the movement; the Spanish city of Melilla, located in Northern Africa, went through an economic boom and its newly acquired bourgeoisie spent a lot of their money in building Modernista buildings. In fact, Melilla is the second city with the largest concentration of Modernista architecture, after Barcelona.  \nAlthough not many people are aware, an example of how political instability affected this movement is the Sagrada Familia itself: this monument is famous for the fact that it hasn't been finished yet, but the reason behind it is the fact that its construction was based on donations[1]. The Spanish Civil War along with Francisco Franco's dictatorship in Spain disrupted the construction of this monument for many years, and significantly slowed it down.  \nDespite all the struggles this movement went through due to its common ideological values, it has been one of the most important art movements to have ever surged in Spain, and its influence is noted on several popular monuments in Catalonia, such as the Sagrada Familia, the greatest achievement of the movement, as well as one of the most well known world monumnets, or the Park Güell, known for its beautiful mosaics and colours. Modernista Architecture generally flourished in Barcelona, and is most well known for its vibrant colours. This movement spreaded to the rest of Catalonia as well, for example the city of Reus is home to many iconic monuments too. The architects took inspiration from many other art movements that included architecture, such as Art Nouveau and the Arts and Crafts Movement. An important feature of Modernista architecture was the emphasis on functionality. The architects and artists from this movement believed that art shouldn't be limited to things like museums and exhibitions, so they wanted to make art a more public thing, by incorporating it into everyday life buildings. Another important part of the architecture was the fact it incorporated traditional Catalan motifs into Modern art, as Catalan culture was seen as \"lesser\" than Spanish culture at the time.  \nAntonio Gaudí was the most important architect of this movement. An huge amount of iconic Modernista architecture examples were created by him, and many of them have become major touristic attractions in Barcelona. His works often used complex forms and very detailed ornaments, as well as lesser used materials like ceramics, stained glass and  iron. His most famous monument is the Sagrada Familia, which has become the most important symbol of Barcelona and is still under construction today.  \nAnother notable Modernista architect is Lluís Domènech i Montaner. His most popular work is the Palau de la Música Catalana, known for its beautiful stained glasses, mosaics and sculptures present in the building.  \nThere were multiple other architects who contributed to the movement, however Josep Puig i Cadafalch is also notable for building the Casa Amatller, a residential building in Barcelona, which was inspired by Gothic architecture. The building is well known for its delicate sculptures and patterns. Since Modernisme was known for its use of new materials, some of those were: Some important Modernista architects included: Although Modernisme mainly flourished in the architecture field, it also had important manifestations in painting, and in fact, the term \"Modernisme\" was first applied to paintings. Modernista paintings were pretty similiar to Art Nouveau itself, however it also had its own distinct regional differences. The paintings would mainly take inspiration from nature, Catalan folklore, symbolism, and the human figure. As seen in many artworks from this movement, flowers and natural elements and colours are very commonly used. The most well known painters of this movement are possibly Santiago Rusiñol and Ramon Casas, who had studied Beaux-Arts in Paris and brought new philosophical ideas to the territory of Catalonia. Their paintings also had notable influence from some French Art Nouveau artists, like Edgar Degas or James Whistler. So, Santiago Rusiñol and Ramon Casas became the most important painters of the movement. Modernista art was presented to the public in private exhibitions in art galleries in Barcelona, especially in the famous Sala Parés. Along with them, the artist Alexandre de Riquer also introduced a new style of Modernisme, which was inspired by Pre-Raphaelitism and rather incorporated symbolism and Fantastical elements such as dreamlike scenes, fairies, nymphs, etc. The philosophy of Modernisme is mainly expressed through literature and political/cultural activism. As such, the most important part of the Catalan Modernist movement was the promotion and divulgation of Catalonia's cultural heritage and identity, which used to be subject to marginalization within the Spanish state. So, Modernist artists and intellectual writers promoted the idea that Catalonia had an unique cultural heritage that needed to be preserved and promoted, and that it shouldn't be considered an inferior or invalid culture just because Catalonia wasn't its own sovereign country. This movement was heavily influenced by the Romanticist Renaixença movement in Catalonia, which had the same objective; reviving and preserving the Catalan language and culture, however Catalan Modernists didn't agree with some political aspects of that movement, such as its religiousness or traditionalism. \nThe political ideas of the movement varied from artist to artist, however, they all had something in common: left-wing and progressist ideas. Some authors such as Jaume Brossa and Gabriel Alomar were Anarchists, while others artists like Miquel dels Sants Oliver were Federalists and Republican.  Because of this, Modernisme often faced competence from other artistic movements of the time which were more conservative, such as Noucentisme.",

Leaning heavily into kawaii and feminine visuals, the term is used for characters that create emotions of affection and adoration. The Moe aesthetic places these characters as its main focus. The term \"Moe\" is a bit broad in of itself, while the term's origin is uncertain, some believe Moe derives from \"Moeru\" (萌える), or \"budding\",  (perhaps to imply someone's budding feelings for a character) Or it could have derived from a character named \"Hotaru Tomoe\" from Sailor Moon. This became a slang word that originally became popular among Otaku on internet forums in the early 1990s, and then spread across mass media in the 2000s. The term then evolved to being used to describe anything cute, although this article is focused on the original definition. Moe as an art style stems from \"𝗕𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗷𝗼\" (美少女) meaning \"beautiful girl\", This style was common in most  80s/90s anime character design, since there was an intent on marketing more to the female demographic, overtime more rounded and \"kawaii\" art styles became dominant in Shoujo series, these character designs often exaggerated certain facial features like making the eyes bigger in order to make them more cute or appealing. While Bishoujo designs emphasize the beauty of a character, these exaggerations usually are used to emphasize the cuteness of the character. This new design eventually branched off to become a major part of feminine character designs in anime and manga. As the Moe style became more popular and influential in anime, the art style for Moe character designs evolved steadily over the decades. Modern Moe designs are much thinner and simpler with linework and exaggerate the chibi-like facial proportions more compared to past anime. The term's origin and etymology are unknown. Anime columnist John Oppliger has outlined several popular theories describing how the term would have stemmed from the name of anime heroines, such as Hotaru Tomoe from Sailor Moon or Moe Sagisawa from the 1993 anime Kyōryū Wakusei. The term first became popular in 1993-94 among users of Japanese bulletin board systems.[1] Moe used in slang refers to feelings of affection, adoration, devotion, and excitement felt towards characters that appear in manga, anime, video games, and other media (usually Japanese). The term is often used to describe a strong emotional response to a character's cuteness, innocence, vulnerability, or other endearing qualities. Moe characters are typically depicted as being cute, charming, and sometimes somewhat naive, which can evoke protective or nurturing feelings in the viewer.[2] Moe Anthropomorphism (萌え擬人化), also referred to as Gijinka characters, is a form of anthropomorphism, and it refers to fictional characters that represent non-human animals, inanimate objects, consumer products or abstract concepts in a humanized form and include moe characteristics[3], such as cuteness, childlike innocence and endearing vulnerability. Sometimes, it can also apply to parodies of real-life persons and historical figures as anime characters. This phenomenon has been  embraced by several anime franchises and has appeared in several forms of media, including manga, video games, and webcomics. While Moe Anthropomorphism on its own is not meant to be offensive or objectifying, it has gained popularity among image board websites like 2channel and 4chan, where they are sometimes given a problematic or political use. A notorious example of a controversial moe anthropomorphic character is \"Ebola-chan\", a personification of ebola created by 4chan users during the 2014 ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. This character was spread around by trolls in African social media websites, along with misinformation about the disease and racist statements. With the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, they created a similar character in 2020  called \"Corona-chan\", which personifies the Coronavirus disease. Other controversial ones include Vivian James, a personification of Gamergate (a cyberharassment campaign targeting women in the gaming industry) or \"ISIS-chan\", a personification of the terrorist organization of the same name. Apart from internet controversies, some specific anime series and games like Fate/Grand Order, which personifies historical and mythological figures from several cultures, and Hetalia: Axis Powers, which personifies the countries of the world, have been criticized for cultural appropiation or insensitivity, since some of these moe characters were inaccurate or encouraged stereotypes.",

This is a very wide aesthetic and it's the mother aesthetic of Werewolf, Vampire, Cryptidcore, Devilcore, and other aesthetics that are centered around monster-like creatures. The word monster comes from the Latin “monstrum,” meaning a portent or prodigy, from the verb “monere,” to warn. Monsters originated from folklore, religion and mythology as beings that are a combination of animal and human traits, such as the Minotaur or Sphinx, and have historically reflected fears and prejudices of a given society. During the 19th century, when the existence of cultural monsters were disproven by scientists, a new type of monster started emerging in fiction - one of the sci-fi variety. Creatures like the monster from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or the various extraterrestrial life forms from H. G. Wells's novels redefined the aesthetic. Vampire folklore and literature such as Bram Stoker's Dracula and werewolf mythos have also been a key part of the aesthetic. In the 20th century the monster aesthetic has grown to be what it is today: with Lovecraft's eldritch monstrosities, Universal Studios' monster movies and the horror genre as a whole centered around monsters cemented Monstercore and its defining traits. The term Monstercore was coined by Tumblr users and has commonly been used as a tag for several pieces of monster-related fanart. Monstercore is characterized by anything that's deemed as \"monster-like\": sharp teeth, claws, animal-like features (not to be confused with furries since the context leans towards horror rather than aesthetic cuteness), traits of marine life, aliens, ethereal beings like monstrous angels and demons, horns, multiple eyes, mutations, etc. Generally speaking, Monstercore traits are present within most mythological beings that have animalistic and human traits, creatures of folklore, religion, mythology and fantasy, so any aesthetic that comes from those fields centering around non-human characters or entities also apply to monstercore, although they lean towards the more graphic side. Body horror can also be part of the aesthetic but can be presented in a cutesy manner, which crosses over with Gurokawa. Plants, fungi, protists and moneran creatures as well as slime beings also fall under monstercore. Some members of the otherkin community identify as certain monsters; these types of otherkin are unofficially referred to as monsterkin. While the term is not commonly recognized, it has been used on occasion by individuals describing themselves as said term. Monsterkin also cross over with Voidpunk followers who have voidsonas due to sharing similar aesthetics, although voidsonas tend to be more eldritch while the personas of monsterkin lean towards the animalistic side. Cryptidkin is a subset of monsterkin that revolve around cryptids like Mothman, Bigfoot, Nessie, etc.",

The aesthetic itself originates from her album of the same name, \"MOTOMAMI\". This aesthetic mainly consists of rebellious young women who have a passion for motorcycles and live an independent and confident lifestyle.  It gained a wide following in Spanish-speaking countries and social media.   The term \"Motomami\" is a combination of the Japanese word \"moto\" (stronger) and the Spanish word \"mami\" (mommy). However the word \"moto\" also means \"motorbike\" in Spanish, referencing ROSALÍA's mother and her love for motorbikes. The album MOTOMAMI was released by ROSALÍA in the 18th of March, 2022 under the Columbia Records record label. Its interesting aesthetic combining multiple cultural, musical and aesthetic influences with Biker culture made her album quickly go viral, with some songs even passing through the language barrier on social media. The MOTOMAMI album and aesthetic brought important attention and popularity in the same year, and as some journalists have described, ROSALÍA's MOTOMAMI album has created a \"before and after\" element to music and fashion in Spanish-speaking social media[1].  \nOn the 10th of February of 2023, ROSALÍA made a collab with Coca-Cola, consisting of a limited edition Coca-Cola flavor called \"Movement\". The design used on the Coca-Cola can uses the same aesthetic used as in her Motomami album, however it used pink instead of red as its primary colour. Fashion involving Biker elements quickly became viral in Spain, especially in Catalonia, where ROSALÍA originally is from. In fact, Motomami was so influential during 2022 and 2023 that Los 40, Spain's most well known music radio, has described 2022 and 2023 as the \"Motomami era\" of Spanish music[2], because her last concert part of the MOTOMAMI World Tour was held on the 22th of July of 2023 in the Lollapalooza Festival of Paris, France. ROSALÍA considers MOTOMAMI to be the most confessional and personal album she has ever made. The Motomami aesthetic typically involves visuals exploring topics such as motorbiking, sexuality, transformation, spirituality, self-esteem, isolation and heartbreak. Another prominent visual in the Motomami aesthetic is Grunge filters, graffiti, scribbled text and symbols. Another visual prominent in this aesthetic are 80s-90s Biker aesthetics, butterflies or Y2K Futurism technology and fashion which often gives a nostalgic appeal to the aesthetic.   \nAnother important part of ROSALÍA's Motomami aesthetic is having fun. She felt like her past albums like \"Los Angéles\" or \"El Mal Querer\" had no place for humoristic topics and fun, and she wanted to finally create a different, lighter album. To ROSALÍA, the Motomami style feels much more playful, creative and happier than her past works, which rather expressed deep topics. The sense of humor in the Motomami aesthetic is expressed through childhood nostalgia elements like sounds from bootleg toys. In her song \"BIZCOCHITO\", she incorporates sounds effects from the iconic Bubblegum Dance bootleg toy phone.  \nAnother important characteristic of the Motomami aesthetic is its promotion of freedom of sexuality and feminism. ROSALÍA, as she said in one of her interviews, believes that sexuality is actually part of many people's daily lives, and it should be celebrated rather than diminished as something shameful. ROSALÍA's Motomami songs have also been described as 'avant-garde' approaches to Reggaeton and Pop music. Some of her songs in the MOTOMAMI album incorporate topics of feminism, since Reggaeton music often includes misogynistic themes and ideas. ROSALÍA herself has said that she wishes for MOTOMAMI to \"provide a feminist counterbalance to misogyny in music\"[3]. Much like the music, the Motomami aesthetic embraces a playful aesthetic and draws inspiration from multiple sources, including various cultures, subcultures and aesthetics; additionally, it also influenced the \"Bikercore\" fashion trend. Generally Motomami takes inspiration from 2000s fashion, Bikerculture, the Choni, Cyberpunk and Punk subcultures as well as Animanga culture. Some of the most commonly used elements in Motomami fashion include: Although the Motomami aesthetic was mainly marketed and pushed by ROSALÍA, it's still important to note that the aesthetic has been adopted by other people and is not necessarily exclusive to her. Some examples of models adopting this style include: The music associated with the Motomami aesthetic respectivily also originated from ROSALÍA's MOTOMAMI album. In the album, she incorporates a really wide set of musical elements and techniques. ROSALÍA mainly took inspiration from Latin musical genres she used to listen to as a kid, such as Reggaeton, Bachata, Urbano and Champeta, as well as Caribbean music and Andalusian Flamenco. In her album she also incorporated elements of Pop, Jazz, Hip-Hop, Cyberpunk and Alternative music, and to a lesser extent, she also incorporates elements of Chiptune, Art Pop, Mambo, Bolero, Electropop, Dembow and Funk Carioca. The songs in her album include a wild mix of musical genres that have little-to-nothing in common with each other, like Reggaeton combined with Jazz in her song \"SAOKO\". Other common characteristics of her song include heavily autotuned sounds, distorted samples, hard synthesizers and sometimes nearly unintelligible vocals, as well as lyrics that might sound nonsensical and audible elements that may not sound like music at all. ROSALÍA has expressed that her MOTOMAMI album is one of the most confessional ones she has ever made. The lyrics often express feelings of transformation, sexuality, heartbreak, celebration, spirituality, self-respect and isolation. Another recurring topic in her songs are ROSALÍA's personal experiences, like references to Pop culture and other musical artists she enjoys or enjoyed as a kid, as well as secret codes through vocals and pitch, referencing her experiences as a musical artist[5]. Because of this, some of the lyrics might seem \"non-sensical\" or \"unintelligible\", however ROSALÍA prioritizes the meaning of her songs' lyrics, and the full meaning of her songs are avaiable on the platform GENIUS. This is a specific subgenre of the Motomami aesthetic that uses pink as a primary colour instead of red. The visuals and other aspects are completely identical. This style can be noted in some of ROSALÍA's collaborations with companies, such as the Coca-Cola Movement collab she made with Coca-Cola. Due to the significant influence of ROSALÍA's Motomami aesthetic on Spanish-speaking social media, a new smaller trend of men adopting the aesthetic surged. The aesthetic itself is nearly identical, with the only exception of having a masculine twist. As described by an user in Urban Dictionary, a Motopapi is a \"a boy with a strong attitude and who can also be very sensitive and have problems at the same time. A Motopapi is always empowered and he always knows what he wants\"[6]. It is called \"Motopapi\" because papi in Spanish means \"daddy\", while mami means \"mommy\". ROSALÍA has been criticized by various American bloggers because they claim that it's 'immoral' for her to adopt influences from other cultures in her songs as a white Spanish Catalan[7], however it's important to note \"cultural appropiation\" isn't a very well known  concept outside the Anglosphere, or is at least seen as inoffensive. ROSALÍA mainly takes inspiration from Latin American and Caribbean cultures, as well as Andalusian Flamenco and traditions that are native to her, like Catalan and Occitan culture. She also included some minor references to Japanese culture, particularly of Otaku origin. Latin American music itself actually holds a great popularity in southern Europe, especially in Spain, Portugal and Italy to a lesser extent. This has led to American critics claiming that she is culturally appropiating from Latin American, Caribbean and Andalusian traditions, however most people from those cultural backgrounds don't actually feel offended at all, especially since her music has become popular in Latin America itself, and ROSALÍA gathered lots of fans in her concerts in the region, as well as collaborating with artists from those cultural backgrounds.",

The visual of the aesthetic applied to digital drawings that use solid colors and lines, or use Windows' built-in image editor, Microsoft Paint. MS Paint was released on 1985, alongside the first version of Microsoft's Windows as an art software. The program was, and still is, very popular, since it comes bundled with all versions of Microsoft Windows. The tool has recently been deprecated in favor of Paint 3D, though it is still accessible today and even received a UI revamp for Windows 11. As is the name, these are usually made in MS Paint, with its limited tools compared to other image editing or art software. Due to these limitations, a lot of the drawings that are made with it low quality (whether it's intentional or not); flat or not, colors with thick, wavy lines, simple features, and some mistakes here and there. A lot of the time, text is done with the text tool and the default font. Thus, these made up the aesthetic. Visuals can be anything, but very popular things are as follows: Due to its easy accessibility on many computers, MS Paint was very popular to use in the early days of YouTube; anywhere from video comics to full animations. Oekaki (お絵描き) is Japanese for \"drawing\". On the internet, it is the term for a simplistic drawing tool used on message boards. It is similar to the MS Paint aesthetic due to the lack of advanced features. Joyful and silly characters made with simple shapes having a circle for a face, became popular in the 2020s. Most of the time there is an emoticon on this face =D, OWO and =3 are the most used emoticons on the face. This also includes the \"TBH creature\".

It is named after the common Y2K Futurism-era fad of music videos existing in worlds with a green sky and green atmosphere. This design aesthetic was common place in most music videos and motion pictures at the time. The blue hues of the video are usually over exaggerated to make them look green and yellow. The look was coined by designer Steves Peeps in 2018. The roots of MTV Green Sky can be traced back to 1997 when the Y2K Futurism aesthetic became popular. Digital coloring became very easy to implement and as such directors could jump on the bandwagon and feel futuristic without much effort. The movie The Matrix in 1999 was famous for using this style. Director Michael Bay used this color scheme for the first Transformers movie that launched in 2007. By 2008, everyone had gone on the digital color grading bandwagon, and it had become too tired for modern tastes.

These subjects coincide with Theatre Academia in the form of musicals. Musical Academia is not strictly adherent to school curriculum, as self-teaching may be just as effective and valid within the aesthetic. Visuals for musical academia lie on a broad spectrum. This can include: Musical Academia is open to interpretation, as it does not base itself on one genre of music. It can vary by culture and genre, as it is the education and knowledge of the music itself that is important to the aesthetic. Appreciation for all music is not necessary, as certain genres may be more appealing to an individual, in which case other music related aesthetics can be combined specifically for that person. For example, musical academia can be mixed with grunge to achieve an aesthetic similar to Kurt Cobain. Music Academia can be applied to a variety of music genres as previously stated. Although, traditionally, certain genres and songs are commonly used for practicing instruments and are well known to music students. Each instrument, family, style, and genre has its own list of standards that everyone who considers themselves a musician of that type must, or at the very least should, know how to play. For this reason, it is nearly impossible to compose a list of songs that encompass all of musical academia. The list of standards for someone who plays jazz vibraphone versus someone who sings opera is going to be different and so on.

McKillipJack the Giant-Killer by Charles de Lint\n\n\nMythpunk refers to a subgenre of mythic fiction in which classical folklore and faerie tales get hyper-poetic post-modern makeovers. Coined by author Catherynne M. Valente, the term describes a brand of speculative fiction which starts in folklore and myth and adds elements of post-modern fantastic techniques: urban fantasy, confessional poetry, non-linear storytelling, linguistic calisthenics, surrealism, world-building, and academic fantasy. Despite the term being coined recently, much of it seems to be influenced by 70s and 80s dark fantasy writing, this particularly includes authors Angela Carter and Tanith Lee. Even a few lighter writers like Patricia A. McKillip (see Elfpunk below) helped define the surreal strangeness inherent in this genre. It is characterized by baroque, multicultural fashion (in the 80s, this was likely inspired by New Romantic style), bold sexuality, bizarre retellings of familiar fairy tales, pervasive anxiety, fear of inevitable change, feminist parables, the brutality of humanity, the dark price of magic, surreal imagery, a twisted sense of humor, elaborate symbolism, and radical reinterpretation. Aesthetically, it’s extremely closely related to Woodland Goth (although the book genre tends to be much darker thematically). Mythpunk visual aesthetics feature a strong connection to subverting the various tropes often found in fairy tales (often with a very dark twist), such as what's found in American McGee's Alice in Wonderland games, but can also draw directly from some already-dark fairy tales that exist (such as Hansel and Gretel). Mythpunk was largely defined through literary works like Andrea Jones's Hook & Jill, Francesca Lia Block's Weetzie Bat series and Catherynne Valente's The Orphan's Tales. Novels like The Shadow of Ararat attempt to tell a grand story with magic in a subversive way, since gods do not play a major role compared to humans, unlike in most Roman and Greek epic stories. The Mythpunk aesthetic occasionally manifests in music (The Decemberists, Siouxsie and the Banshees, etc.), films like Pan's Labyrinth, Jim Henson’s The Storyteller, and The Company of Wolves (through this is a more a proto-example), cartoons (Over the Garden Wall and The Owl House), video games (The Path and Inscryption), comic books (Fables), fashion, and most other art forms. Although this subgenre shares many elements with Urban Fantasy and more or less Dark Fantasy, Mythpunk stories tend to avoid linear or obvious story structures, simple prose, and easily-discernible character archetypes. Elfpunk is sub-genre of urban fantasy in which traditional mythological creatures such as faeries or elves are put into semi-modern, often Punk or Goth inspired urban settings or in surreal, dream-like writing that is a more fantasy-leaning version of Magical Realism. It has been seen since the 1980s fantasy boom and still exists today thanks to YA urban fantasy writers like Holly Black and Julie Kagawa. (It's noted as a subgenre because Elfpunk tends to be somewhat lighter in tone compared to most Mythpunk works.) What also differentiates it is the stronger aesthetic imagery. Due to many of these urban fantasy writers in the 80s being musicians, they often filled their books with references to Punk, Goth, and New Romantic fashion but with a fey twist (see Woodland Goth, which discusses this previously unnamed aesthetic). Writers in this genre include Terri Windling, Charles de Lint, Emma Bull, Patricia A. McKillip, Will Shetterly, and Neil Gaiman. (Fantasy artists Brian and Wendy Froud, Charles Vess, and Kinuko Y. Craft and legendary puppeteer Jim Henson also helped create this aesthetic.) Examples in film include the movies Labyrinth and MirrorMask, in TV shows like Once Upon A Time, and in tabletop gaming, the World of Darkness RPG Changeling: The Dreaming. Much Chinese fantasy can be classed as mythpunk. Some cultivation novels have main characters who assimilate whole multiverses and are overall so ruthless, they put the Borg from Star Trek to shame. Capepunk can be seen as a modern spin on what are modern fairy tales by some definitions: superhero stories. Worm, the first story in the Parahumans fictional universe, has main character Taylor Hebert go through a tragic journey of loss inspired by Middle Eastern folklore and beliefs about the apocalypse. The Endbringers are terrifying monsters named after Biblical beasts, and the characters who can see or know the future get some things tragically wrong in how they plan, similar to how attempts by Biblical prophets to predict the future usually failed horribly.",

The name translates to pretend school uniform, referring to how the fashion of the aesthetic is based upon wearing outfits that appear to be a school uniform. As an aesthetic, Nanchatte Seifuku heavily focuses on academic visuals and motifs but not so much about the learned subject matter, as the goal is to experience comfort and joy from themes and visuals similar to modest private school life as opposed to high-end boarding school aesthetics like Preppy or the American school based High School Dream. Main themes of the aesthetic include friendship, personal growth, learning, and more. This aesthetic is based off of being comforted by the seeing of traditional school life. The main fashion is based on wearing pretend versions of school uniforms. It's related to Kogal as both aesthetics feature Japanese school uniforms, but the main difference is that Nanchatte Seifuku tends to be more modest and conservative, encouraging knee-length skirts, covered shoulders, and long socks/stockings. Also, Kogal outfits can include modifications of a real school uniform, while Nanchatte Seifuku has to be pretend (otherwise it's just seifuku). A common type of uniform is the sailor-suit based serafuku (セーラーふく, sailor uniform) worn by mainly middle schoolers, but other types of uniforms can also be worn.

Due to the role the Nazi Party played in history and the subsequent sensitive and offensive nature of this aesthetic, it is not recommended that you adopt it for yourself. Aesthetics Wiki does not endorse Nazi ideology - but it is important to acknowledge its impact on modern culture.'' Nazi Chic is an aesthetic centered around the use of Nazi-era style, imagery, and paraphernalia in clothing and popular culture, especially when used for taboo-breaking or shock value rather than out of genuine sympathies with Nazism or Nazi ideology, although it can be used as a tool to critique elements of contemporary society by drawing allusions to the Nazi Party and their laundry list of evils they committed. A popular use of the Nazi Chic aesthetic occurred in the mid-1970s with the emergence of the Punk movement in London: the Sex Pistols' first television appearance occurred with a person of their entourage wearing a swastika.  This was, however, done as an attempt to shock and offend the status quo rather than showing any sympathies towards the Nazi party as the Punk subculture had a mostly left-wing bent to their ideology with many adherents adopting more of an anarchist philosophy.  Once the actual Nazis began to show up, however, the Punk community ceased to co-opt these sorts of aesthetic cues and collectively pushed them out of the community (which led to the creation of RAC: Rock Against Communism, much in the same way Fashwave came about after similar push-back from the Synthwave and Vaporwave communities).  This push-back is best highlighted in the Dead Kennedys song \"Nazi Punks Fuck Off\". In the Nazi Chic aesthetic, a lot of Nazi symbolism and iconography is implemented, but unlike with an aesthetic like Fashwave (which is genuinely designed to promote Nazism and fascism), most actual adherents to the Nazi Chic aesthetic aren't actually trying to promote Nazism or have sympathies towards white nationalism and white supremacy.  This would later come to inspire the Troma film Surf Nazis Must Die, a humorous little film about ACTUAL Surf Nazis (portrayed as the villains, of course). One of the first known examples of this Nazi Chic aesthetic at play is actually 1950s and 1960s with the \"Surf Nazis\", who would often paint Swastikas on their car and wear Nazi stormtrooper helmets because, at the time, nobody thought a decent-sized chunk of people would genuinely start to buy into Nazi philosophy again.  Nazi iconography was also utilized in a string of Nazi-sploitation films in the Grindhouse Cinema circuit in the 60's and 70's, most well known of them being Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS. However, that isn't to say that Nazi Chic aesthetics can't be used to make a deeper, more meaningful commentary on the oppressiveness of some elements of society these days, as they will often evoke Nazi imagery in works of art (like Lady Gaga's \"Alejandro\" or Marilyn Manson's \"The Fight Song\") in an attempt to not only shock people (as is typically the case with this aesthetic) but also to critique these elements by, quite literally, comparing them to Nazis. Nazi Chic fashion often borrows heavy elements from Nazi fashion (thanks in part to individuals like Hugo Boss and Coco Chanel and their ties to the Nazi Party) of the day and make nods to the many \"accomplishments\" of the Nazi Party during their run in the 30's and 40's, but it's surprisingly become popular in Asian countries, especially in Japan and Hong Kong (which, given the fact Japan were allies of the Nazis in World War II, it's not too surprising they might still show sympathies to them in the modern era).  Often times, though, the Nazi Chic aesthetic is merely used in cosplay to invoke the look of a particular character who might be a stand-in for the evils of fascism in a particular work (this is more commonly done in the realm of anime and manga due to the full scope of what the Nazis did not really being taught in Japanese high schools, along with some of the more evil elements of Japan's actions during the same time like The Nanking Massacre).

The music genre is aesthetically characterized by its emphasis on dark topics like murder, gore, death, drugs, the glorification of Middle Eastern terrorism, suicide, and multiple other forms of graphic content. Necrotrap music is characterized by its noisy sound, heavily distorted and deep-fried vocals, lyrics relating to suicide attacks, \"corpse\" vocals and whispers, aggressive beats and eerie melodies.   This musical genre is closely associated to a music collective from SoundCloud called \"Necrosociety\"[2], whose members pioneered the genre. It is particularly popular in SoundCloud underground Hip-Hop communities. The emergence of Necrotrap can be attributed to the evolution of Trap Metal (also called Screamo Rap), which is a musical genre that combines elements of Trap music and Heavy Metal, as its name suggests. Trap Metal itself originated in the late 2010s and gained popularity through artists like Scarlxrd and Zillakami.  \nThe term \"Necrotrap\" was coined by the Canadian musical artist Gorejit in 2020[3], and later, he became part of a music collective called \"Necrosociety\", formed by multiple Necrotrap artists. The musical genre started to decline in 2023 due to controversies surrounding the Necrotrap community, including the artist Gorejit, who quit music in December 2022. However, the genre still continues to thrive in SoundCloud. The visual and aesthetic elements associated with Necrotrap music are characterized by their emphasis on dark topics. This is reflected in Necrotrap cover art, lyrics and artist names, which are often provocative and/or offensive. These dark topics featured in Necrotrap songs often include explicit descriptions of violence, self-harm or suicide, weaponry, drug abuse, and even terrorism, particularly those relating to Middle Eastern terrorists. Cover art usually features scribbled drawings that depict acts of violence, like shootings, beheadings and bombings. Overall, the aesthetic is likely meant to be either extremely edgy or straight up shock content. The general aesthetic of Necrotrap music could be briefly described as a mix of Emo culture and graphic taboo topics. The most common argument against Necrotrap music is how it simplifies, glorifies and possibly even romanticizes terrorist attacks and other forms of violence related to Arab Paramilitary groups. This particular element of the songs and its aesthetic has become problematic because most of the people involved in the Necrotrap music scene are white American/Canadian teenagers fascinated by violence, who often don't have a proper cultural or historical understanding of the political climate of the Middle East and the Islamic world. This musical genre has also been subject to censorship in some platforms like Spotify due to its strong emphasis on edgy and questionable topics. Necrotrap has also received criticism for being nearly unlistenable. Its usage of extremely distorted vocals and samples make the music way too noisy and niche to listen to. Additionally, Necrotrap lyrics are often criticized for being \"cringy\" or way \"too edgy for the sake of being edgy\"[4]. Another trait that made Necrotrap music decline in late 2022-2023 is the toxicity present in its fanbase. Many people in the fanbase were known to dox and/or scam other people, and engaging in other problematic behaviors like telling people to kill themselves, or saying racial slurs[5]. This led to a few musical artists as well as fans quitting.",

Similiarly to Neo-Romanism or Neo-Viking, this aesthetic draws heavy inspiration from ancient Celtic culture and mythology and puts it in a modern setting along with other modern elements. Neo-Celticism became really popular in the westernmost regions of Europe due to the influence of the Celtic Revival movement. Some visuals included in Neo-Celtic edits include: The Celtic culture is thought to have originated sometime around 3000 years ago. The Celts were a really diverse group of ancient tribes including Gauls, Galaicos, Armoricans, Celtiberians, Galatians, Bastarnae, Astures, Britons, Icenis, Noris, Gaels, Ulaids, Scordiscis, Picts, Cantabrians, the Hallstatt culture, and many other tribes, which were really widespread in Europe before the rise of Roman Imperialism, Romanization and other socio-cultural factors in former Celtic territories over the many years. Nowadays, most of these Celtic tribes no longer exist as they were replaced by different tribes and cultures.  The Celtic culture mainly survived in the British Isles and Brittany in the northwest of France. The remaining insular Celtic culture diversified into that of the modern Gaels (Irish, Scottish and Manx people) and the modern Celtic Britons (Welsh, Cornish, and Breton people) of the Medieval and modern periods. After the rise of Romanticism in Europe, a modern Neo-Celtic identity was constructed as part of the Romanticistic Celtic Revival in Britain, Ireland, Brittany and other European territories interested in the Celtic revival such as Galicia or Asturias in Spain. Today Irish Gaelic, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton are still spoken in parts of their respective territories, but all of them faced or still face issues including cultural assimiliation and governmental repression due to English and French rule. The Cornish and Manx languages also went extinct at one point, but due to the Neo-Celticist movement, the languages are being revitalized today. The six territories widely considered Celtic nations today are Brittany, Cornwall, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and the Isle of Man, and sometimes other territories such as Galicia, Devon, Cumbria, Asturias or Cantabria, as they may participate in Celtic revivalism despite not having an alive Celtic language. Neo-Celtic Architecture is technically an imagined version of what ancient Celtic architecture looked like and what it would look like if it survived into the modern age. Celtic architecture during Pre-history and the Classical Age was really diverse, however Neo-Celtic architecture mainly takes inspiration from Celtic roundhouses, which were popular among the westernmost regions of Europe. Because of this, Neo-Celtic architecture revival wasn't very successful due to the lack of resources on ancient Celtic architecture. The most well known Neo-Celtic architect was the Hungarian architect Imre Makovecz. As religion is also a major part of a culture, the Neo-Celticist movement also reconstructed the ancient Celtic religion. Celtic Neo-paganism is a polytheistic religion, meaning they worship multiple deities. They celebrate the cross-quarter festivals (AKA the major holidays) and the solstices and equinoxes (AKA the minor holidays). The Celtic new year is November 1st, a day after Samhain (also called Halloween), when the veil between the spirit world and the human world was supposedly lifted. Pan-Celticism is a Romanticist political, social and cultural movement in support of unification, solidarity and cooperation between the modern inhabitants of the Celtic regions (those of Gaelic and Brittonic origin) and all modern Celts of Northwestern Europe. This movement heavily influenced the Neo-Celtic aesthetic and can be traced back to the Celtic Revival movement of Romanticism which first appeared in 1838 and peaked during and after the 1900s. Generally the main territories today considered Celtic are Ireland (including Northern Ireland), Scotland, Wales, Brittany, Cornwall and the Isle of Man, because according to most Pan-Celtic organizations the general rule for a territory to be considered Celtic is the presence of a Celtic language. However by other standards, other territories which participate in the Celtic revival include Galicia, Asturias and Cantabria in northwestern Spain, Nova Scotia in Canada and Cumbria and Devon in the United Kingdom. So, the Neo-Celtic aesthetic is also mostly prevalent in those territories, especially in their media, music and musical videos; however it's worth noting their cultures themselves are not an aesthetic and only influence the Neo-Celtic aesthetic. For about a century (from 1838 to 1939), the Pan-Celtic movement was one of the most influential nationalist movements. The first Pan-Celtic gatherings were held at festivals of Celtic culture such as Gorsedd and Eisteddfod, in 1917 the International Celtic Congress was formed, which is held annually. Since then, the Celtic League has been considered to be the face of the Pan-Celtic movement. Nowadays pan-Celticists prefer cultural exchange rather than political cooperation, as various pan-Celtic music, art and literature festivals are organized. The Neo-Celtic aesthetic is often associated with Folk-Pop and Folk-Rock music inspired by traditional Celtic folk songs. Neo-Celtic media takes inspiration from many sources.

It is a resurgent, evolved and modern version of the ideas of Pop Art artists from the 50s, capturing some of its commercial ideas and Kitsch aspects. However, unlike in Pop Art, Neo-Pop takes inspiration from a wider amount of sources and techniques. Neo-Pop artists sometimes use imagery related to pop culture, such as cartoons, advertisements, and celebrities, but they often change the context of these images to create new meanings. This art movement gave origin to other art movements such as Lowbrow, Pop-Surrealism, and Superflat Pop. The term \"Neo-Pop\" was coined by Japanese critic Noi Sawaragi in 1992. The term described artists and art influenced by Pop Art and other types of pop culture, such as Jeff Koons, but also artists working in graffiti and cartoon art. The first wave of Neo-Pop art emerged in the 1980s as a reaction against Minimalism and Conceptualism[1]. Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf and Takashi Murakami are considered the pioneers of Neo-Pop art. Additionally, Takashi Murakami's art eventually evolved into a new distinct art movement, known as Superflat. Neo-Pop art's visuals actually don't retain many aspects of traditional Pop Art, and rather convey its ideas into modern times. Neo-Pop  takes elements from Pop Art like its emphasis on popular culture, consumerism and mass media and its bright colour palette. The visuals are mainly rooted in vibrant colors, diverse patterns (like polka dots, flowers, hearts, stars, lines, etc.) and a mix of imagery from everyday life, like advertisements and pop culture. Neo-Pop artists often took inspiration from celebrities and iconic trademarks to make their artworks. Additionally, the visuals often convey some sort of ironic or humoristic message; in fact, some Neo-Pop artworks referenced political issues and hoaxes that weren't actually real.",

It is also the judicial system that governs many 21st century democracies. Neo-Romanism began to boom with the popularization of neo-pagan religions such as Hellenism and the Roman Way at the end of the 20th Century, which have influenced its \"romantic\" vision of those times. Neo-Romanism has had many antecedents before it became what it was. Since the fall of the Roman Empire in 1453 many rulers have tried to rebuild or even consider themselves heirs of the Roman Empire. The most notorious example was Fascist Italy during World War II which unsuccessfully tried to rebuild a kind of Second Roman Empire. On an artistic level, movements such as the Renaissance and Neoclassicism. Its great difference with these two aesthetics consists mainly in how they present technology, looks, architecture and culture. Since Neo-Romanism is much more attached to the present or Science Fiction, with influences from Greek and Roman cultures, than a retro-futuristic vision of how those societies would have advanced. Neo-Romanism has not only extended to art or judicial systems. It has also acquired political overtones, with projects such as the Nova Roma organization: an international organization of admirers of the culture of Ancient Rome, claiming to be a nation of modern Romans with the administrative structure modeled on the institutions of the Roman Republic. Nova Roma explicitly states that they are not a micronation, but a civitas or res publica. Their organization, however, fits all the requirements to be classified as such. Another Neo-Roman micronation project that stands out (especially in the Spanish-speaking world) is the so-called Republic of Tiberia. The Neo-Romans call for a return to the classical values of ancient Rome and Greece, but without disregarding certain modern benefits. They simply consider that the excessive invidualism or collectivism of modern European societies of the 20th and 21st century has been more harmful than beneficial and is what has led these societies into a state of decadence. And to avoid a new Dark Age and for Humanity to prosper they must return to those values that once made them great. In this case, that of one of the most influential cultures, Ancient Rome. Among the activities of Neo-Romanism, the following stand out: The Neo-Romanism aesthetic has its own music, which is a sub-genre of Bardcore, known as Ancient Bardcore. It recreates contemporary music in the style of the Ancient Ages. Also, Low Bap, a sub-genre of Hip-Hop that emerged in Greece, Greek Lo - Fi Hip - Hop and Ancient Hip - Hop  could be considered part of this aesthetic. Neo-Romanism also reached the world of fashion. With companies such as Dolce Gabanna creating clothing collections inspired by the fashion of Byzantium (Eastern Roman Empire). On an artistic level, as is obvious beyond his influences of the Renaissance, Neoclassicism and the classic world. On the Internet, the Neo-Roman art looks quite influenced by Vaporwave (particularly because of its use of works belonging to the  Renaissance) and Hustlewave using the aesthetics of the first and the positivism of the second in order to encourage a return to the values and culture of Ancient Greece and Rome. Neo-Romanism has also reached the world of sports. With companies like the startup Unified Weapons Master wanting to \"resurrect\" gladiator fights, but in an modernized way. Neo-Romanism has also reached the world of cuisine, as there is a restaurant known as Toro. It is characterised by its Pan-Asian / Latin influences when it comes to its food. Although it does not have a defined ideology, the Pan-Latinism ideology is considered part of the aesthetics and the movement, as it has influenced many of its members. Pan-Latinism as an ideology is a pan-nationalist ideology that first appeared in France which supports the unity or unification of the Romance language-speaking ethnic groups, including Italians, French people, Spaniards, Portuguese people, Romanians, Moldovans and every other Romance ethnic group such as the Catalans, Walloons, Occitans, Galicians, Sicilians, among many others. Sometimes they may also include the ex-colonies of the Romance-speaking countries. Like the anarcho-frontierism and their aesthetics known as Space Cowboy. They support the idea of transhumanism, but with certain limits. Although there is freedom and many types of cults, within Neo-Romanism, there are four main groups: Roman Way (those who try to recreate the Ancient Roman religion as faithfully as possible) Hellenism, Cult of Mars ( Inspired by the Cult of Mars from the fictional universe of Fallout ) [ See Khorne ideology for more information on movements, cults, ideas, etc...Very much based on fictional counterparts ] and Christianity ( Though not so much like the modern branches, but more inspired by early Christianity ).",

Neo-Tribal design is characterized by its eye-catching patterns inspired by tribal tattoos, particularly those of Māori or Polynesian origin, but it is not limited to those cultures. It also uses other elements like symbolism, sigils and geometric patterns. Essentially, it mixes ancient ethnic patterns with modern art tecniques and aesthetics. Neo-Tribal symbology from the 2000s typically involves imagery that teenagers of the time found cool and rebellious, like angel, butterfly, demon and bat wings, crosses, hearts, etc. Consequently, Neo-Tribal art is often associated with various aesthetics and Alternative musical genres, including Y2K Futurism, Chromecore, Sigilkore, Deathcore, etc. The Neo-Tribal aesthetic isn't meant to be confused with the term neo-tribalism[1], which refers to the political philosophy concerning the concept of modern society being run by tribes. Some people prefer using the term \"Cybertribal\" to contrast the difference. Some visuals found in Neo-Tribal design include: The Neo-Tribal aesthetic particularly flourishes in the tattoo industry[2]. The term \"Neo-Tribal\" was originally coined by western tattoo artists to incorporate influence from Māori tribal tattoos without making their artworks sound \"culturally appropiating\". Neo-Tribal tattoos are usually black and have sharp black lines and dots. This tattoo tecnique has also evolved into a more recent tecnique called \"Cybersigilism\", as some Neo-Tribal tattoos often incorporate more influence from sigil symbology. Particularly Cybersigilism incorporates even more influence from the Y2K Futurism era or even Cyberpunk, including elements like black angles, thin lines and black ink[3]. Tramp stamps are often made in the Cybersigilist style as well, including Succubus symbols, hearts, butterfly wings, etc.  \nThis style is also often incorporated into shirts and hoodies as prints.

It is not known who the creator of the Neo-Viking genre is, however the earliest work of this aesthetic dates back to 1963 with the creation of the novel Space Viking by writer Henry Beam Piper, where Neo-Viking takes one of its names from. The Neo-Viking genre would become popular in the early 1960s, especially after the release of Henry Beam Piper's novel Space Vikings and the well-known series Lost In Space, which would release an episode that mixed space and Nordic mythology in 1965. As it became popular, however, it fell rapidly in the oblivion. It would not be until the early 2010s that it would make a return, with the \"alien\" interpretation made by the Marvel Cinematic Universe after the release of the first Thor movie. Similar to Neo-Romanism, the Space Vikings are heavily influenced by the Space Romans trope. The big difference is that in these cases, it is not an usually alien culture similar to those that existed on Earth, but of a resurgence of these cultures in a distant future where humanity has gone deep into the cosmos, and in some media such as Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, an interpretation of Norse mythology under the Ancient Astronaut theory. The visuals of this aesthetic consists mainly of a mixture of science fiction with elements of Viking culture; not historical, but more along the lines of the romanticization of vikings that occurred in the 19th century creating a feeling of something between the mystical and futuristic. Neo-Viking music, typically consists of mixing traditional Nordic music with futuristic elements. The best example of this has been created by Dovydas.",

Inspired by the excavations of the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum from 1748, a renewed interest in the arts of antiquity occurred. Embracing order and restraint, it developed in reaction to the perceived frivolity, hedonism and decadence of Rococo and exemplifying the rational thinking of the 'Age of Enlightenment' (aka the 'Age of Reason'). Initially, the movement was developed not by artists, but by Enlightenment philosophers. They requested replacing Rococo with a style of rational art, moral and dedicated to the soul. This fitted well with a perception of Classical art as the embodiment of realism, restraint and order. Inspired by ancient Greek and Roman art, the classical history paintings of the French artist Nicolas Poussin (1594–1665) and the ideas of the German writer Anton Raphael Mengs (1728–1779) and the archaeologist and art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–1768), Neoclassicism began in Rome, but soon spread throughout Europe. Rome had become the main focus of the Grand Tour by the mid-18th century, and aristocratic travellers went there in search of Classical visions to recreate on their country estates, thus spreading the style across Europe, particularly in England and France. The tour was also an opportunity for collecting Classical antiquities. Neoclassical paintings tended to be populated with figures posed like Classical statues or reliefs, set in a locations filled with archaeological details. The style favoured Greek art over Roman, considering it purer and more authentically classical in its aesthetic goal. In 1789, France was on the brink of its first revolution and Neoclassicism sought to express their patriotic feelings. Politics and art were closely entwined during this period. They believed that art should be serious, and valued drawings above painting; smooth contours and paint with no discernible brushstrokes were the ultimate aim. Both painting and sculpture exerted calmness and restraint and focused on heroic themes, expressing such noble notions as self-sacrifice and nationalism. This movement paved the way for Romanticism, that appeared when the idealism of the revolution faded away and after the Napoleonic period came to an end in the early 19th century. Neoclassicism should not be seen as the opposite of Romanticism, however, but in some ways an early manifestation of it. Neoclassical architecture focused on Ancient Greek and Roman details, plain, white walls and grandeur of scale. Compared to the previous styles, Baroque and Rococo, Neoclassical exteriors tended to be more minimalist, featuring straight and angular lines, but being still ornamented. The style's clean lines and sense of balance and proportion worked well for grand buildings (such as the Panthéon in Paris) and for smaller structures alike (such as the Petit Trianon). Excavations during the 18th century at Pompeii and Herculaneum, which had both been buried under volcanic ash during the 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius, inspired a return to order and rationality.[179] In the mid-18th century, antiquity was upheld as a standard for architecture as never before. Neoclassicism was a fundamental investigation of the very bases of architectural form and meaning. In the 1750s, an alliance between archaeological exploration and architectural theory started, which will continue in the 19th century. Marc-Antoine Laugier wrote in 1753 that 'Architecture owes all that is perfect to the Greeks'. The style was adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia. Federal-style architecture is the name for the classicizing architecture built in North America between c. 1780 and 1830, and particularly from 1785 to 1815. This style shares its name with its era, the Federal Period. The term is also used in association with furniture design in the United States of the same time period. The style broadly corresponds to the middle-class classicism of Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, Regency style in Britain and to the French Empire style. In Central and Eastern Europe, the style is usually referred to as Classicism (German: Klassizismus, Russian: Классицизм), while the newer Revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical. Étienne-Louis Boullée (1728–1799) was a visionary architect of the period. His utopian projects, never built, included a monument to Isaac Newton (1784) in the form of an immense dome, with an oculus allowing the light to enter, giving the impression of a sky full of stars. His project for an enlargement of the Royal Library (1785) was even more dramatic, with a gigantic arch sheltering the collection of books. While none of his projects were ever built, the images were widely published and inspired architects of the period to look outside the traditional forms. Similarly with the Renaissance and Baroque periods, during the Neoclassical one urban theories of how a good city should be appeared too. Enlightenment writers of the 18th century decried the problems of Paris at that time, the biggest one being the big number of narrow medieval streets crowded with modest houses. Voltaire openly criticized the failure of the French Royal administration to initiate public works, improve the quality of life in towns, and stimulate the economy. 'It is time for those who rule the most opulent capital in Europe to make it the most comfortable and the most magnificent of cities. There must be public markets, fountains which actually provide water and regular pavements. The narrow and infected streets must be widened, monuments that cannot be seen must be revealed and new ones built for all to see', Voltaire insisted in a polemical essay on 'The Embellishments of Paris' in 1749. In the same year, La Font de Saint-Yenne, criticized how Louis XIV's great east façade of the Louvre, was all but hidden from views by a dense quarter of modest houses. Voltaire also said that in order to transform Paris into a city that could rival ancient Rome, it was necessary to demolish more than it was to built. 'Our towns are still what they were, a mass of houses crowded together haphazardly without system, planning or design', Marc-Antoine Laugier complained in 1753. Writing a decade later, Pierre Patte promoted an urban reform in quest of health, social order, and security, launching at the same time a medical and organic metaphor which compared the operations of urban design to those of the surgeons. With bad air and lack of fresh water its current state was pathological, Patte asserted, calling for fountains to be placed at principal intersections and markets. Squares are recommended promote the circulation of air, and for the same reason houses on the city's bridges should be demolished. He also criticized the location of hospitals next to markets and protested continued burials in overcrowded city churchyards. Bsides cities, new ideas of how a garden should be appeared in 18th century England, making place for the English landscape garden (aka jardin à l'anglaise), characterized by an idealized view of nature, and the use of Greco-Roman or Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. It was the opposite of the symmetrical and geometrically planned Baroque garden (aka jardin à la française).",

It creates a dreamlike atmosphere with stylized visuals with a vibrant saturation, neon text, and an overall feeling of existencial isolation. Neon Noir is heavily associated with Synthwave, with most Neon Noir media incorporating it to emphasize the loneliness. Neon Noir combines the dark and mysterious elements of Noir films with a vibrant and futuristic aesthetic akin to neon lights. It has a strong focus on dark scenery that is contrasted by the the vivid and surreal glow of neon sights in the nightlife of cities. Characters are often depicted as only dark silhuettes against a neon-lit backdrop with fog or smoke creating a dreamlike atmosphere. The scenes are sometimes accompanied by rain, which reflects the neon lights and intensifies the contrast between the wet, reflective surfaces and the darkness of the night.[1] Despite its loud and bright presentation, Neon Noir in media retains the classic elements of the Neo-Noir film genre of violence and characters with moral ambiguity. If any medium can compete with movies and TV in terms of taking on the Neon Noir aesthetic, it's video games. While most Neon Noir video games look like games that could've been played on an original Nintendo, there are some that have very polished next-gen graphics. Examples of Neon Noir video games include Hotline Miami, Hotline Miami 2, Detroit Become Human, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, Saturday Morning RPG, Trials of the Blood Dragon, Neon Drive, Power Drive 2000, Furi, Katana ZERO, BONEWORKS/BONELAB, 2064: Read Only Memories, and Double Dragon Neon.

The term \"nerd\" originated in the 1950s from a Dr. Seuss book, and has been used for anxious, book-smart culture and people ever since. Nerds will often be seen as lacking social skills, and have many stereotypes surrounding how they dress (e.g. wearing glasses, a bowtie, overalls, high socks, slacks, and/or braces). Nerdy hobbies or interests are a big part of this aesthetic, and include sci-fi and fantasy, board games and video games, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) subjects and other similar topics. It is one of the four high school stereotypes popularly used to classify students, along with Prep, Jock, and Goth. Nerd visual aesthetics will often take on references to popular fields and media indulged in by nerds, as well as the stereotypical depictions of nerds ranging from the 1950s all the way up to the 1990s before nerd subculture and media started becoming more mainstream, similar to other mainstream subcultures such the preppy, bro, and emo subcultures (in the past), and accepted by society in some way, shape, or form. Nerds don't have a specific style that is always followed, although anything which aligns with typically nerdy interests will make the look instantly nerdier. Any math, physics, science or nerdy interest-based clothing seems nerdy, even without the stereotypical glasses. Although being a nerd doesn't tend to have a specific look, they generally won't look trendy or extremely fashionable, unless nerdy fashion has come into the mainstream for a bit. The general look is usually seem as a shirt and tie or nerdy T-shirt and jeans, but there really isn't any specific guidelines to follow to look nerdy. However, nerds are rarely seen without wearing their glasses. Another direction one could apply to the Nerd aesthetic in terms of fashion is partaking in the art of cosplay, or the act of putting effort into dressing up as a character from any form of media. While this is primarily done for conventions of some sort, there are some who will take photos of themselves in cosplay and post them on the internet (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr in particular are popular platforms for this sort of thing). Starting in the 2000s, there has been a proud tradition of nerd culture-inspired music covering a vast array of genres, ranging from rock music to rap music.  Outside of the nerd-specific genres, it has also found its way to seeing notes of it pop up in mainstream music, with many rappers dropping references to video games, comic books, and anime (a trend that can be traced back to the Wu-Tang Clan in the 1990s) as well as EDM artists making nods to the genre (ranging from Daft Punk's Interstella 5555 anime done in collaboration with legendary anime producer Leiji Matsumoto to promote their Discovery album to Porter Robinson and Madeon's music video for the song \"Shelter\" done in collaboration with anime streaming service Crunchyroll and anime studio A-1 Pictures). Nerds often like science fiction-based media, such as Doctor Who, Star Trek and Star Wars. Watching sci-fi shows and movies aren't all that there is to this interest, as many of the board games and even video games some nerds will play will have sci-fi elements to them. Fantasy books, TV shows, and games are usually paired along with the sci-fi interest, as the two genres cross over greatly. The fantasy genre can go anywhere from superhero shows to D&D, Lord of the Rings to cartoons. Video games are sort of a common nerdy interest, and along with it, can come a love of computers and technology. Video games often have fantasy or science fiction elements, and this can be a big part of the interest. These are also great for introverts, which is often seen as a part of being a nerd, as most games don't require you to speak to anyone, at least in person. As of recently, video games are no longer a nerdy thing, but more of a mainstream thing, however obscure or old games are usually classified as “nerdy” As with video games, board games are a common nerdy interest and even more than video games. Board games can often have sci-fi or fantasy components to them (talking to you, Dungeons and Dragons!), although since some, such as chess, are more logic-based, they still fit into the interest. Since nerds often value knowledge, games that are based on puzzle-like problem-solving and logic components also fit perfectly into this category. Nerds often value curiosity, and science can explain everything that happens, even if we aren't always sure yet. If nerds get the chance, they'll usually want to ask questions about how things work. Similarly to science (since it is a type of science!), physics explains things which otherwise wouldn't be understood. Of course, theoretical physics is an entirely different matter! Since not knowing which is the right theory can definitely make one curious, this is often seen as a particularly nerdy branch of physics, also considering the difficulty of math. This is very much a nerdy topic, despite how large an area it can be seen to be covering. Coding and computer science are things which explain computers, which are a thing which nerds generally love, so it makes sense that these go together. Some nerds prefer older computers and other technology, and others are agnostic. Math, on its own, is nerdy enough, but when you look at the other interests, it only makes sense for math to make the list. Physics needs maths to explain it, science is similar, technology is based around coding which runs on math in a way. Math is necessary for many of the other nerdy hobbies. Since knowledge is such a big component to the values of nerds, nerds will often enjoy reading, and read about their nerdy interests, such as sci-fi novels, fantasy books, theoretical physics non-fiction and whatever their personal interests are. Reading often makes its way into the other interests, but it is its own thing, so it qualifies as a full interest as it is a very broad subject.",

Neubrutalism's namesake originates from the architectural movement Brutalism, which utilized unpainted concrete and geometric designs, favoring functionality over conventional aesthetic standards; Brutalism was minimalist, utilitarian, monochrome in nature. Although Brutalism and Neubrutalism are very different visually, they both share the core value of breaking the conventions of design and create visuals in their most basic shapes and forms. The earliest example of the Neubrutalist movement can be traced as back to the Early/Mid-2010s, but the aesthetic that is commonly recognized as Neubrutalism would not form until the Late-2010s/Early-2020s, when it started to become more widespread. In 2022, Neubrutalism became mainstream within UI/UX and graphic design, with websites, apps, and advertisement adopting the aesthetic. Neubrutalism's visuals focus on defying the traditional principles of design. This is contrast to Flat Design, which focuses on conforming to the traditional conventions of design. However, Neubrutalism and Flat Design both share the common purpose of easing accessibility and improving functionality. Neubrutalism's key visual motifs include: Neubrutalism is also heavily driven by 1990s and Early-2000s nostalgia, especially driven by Memphis Design and Old Web, which both share visual motifs with Neubrutalism such as geometric shapes, zig-zagged lines, graph paper grids, computer windows/tabs and icons, and Y2K Futurism inspired imagery.",

It is used by listeners for yoga, massage, meditation, reading as a method of stress management to bring about a state of ecstasy rather than trance, or to create a peaceful atmosphere in their home or other environments, and is associated with environmentalism and New Age spirituality.

One of the key values is peacefulness, but this is not the same as harmlessness. it is advisable to understand the culture and history before making it a part of your identity. Dreamcatchers also have significant history to native America, but Celtic druids did make triangle-shaped dreamcatchers. New Age visuals include everything related to one's spiritual path, which can vary from person to person. Some examples are: Fashion is often inspired by Hippie fashion, and can include: New-age music includes both acoustic forms, featuring instruments such as flutes, piano, acoustic guitar, and a wide variety of non-Western acoustic instruments, and electronic forms, frequently relying on sustained synth pads or long sequencer-based runs. Vocal arrangements were initially rare in the genre, but as it has evolved vocals have become more common especially those featuring Native American-, Sanskrit-, or Tibetan-influenced chants, or lyrics based on mythology such as Celtic legends. New Age music is sometimes referred to as World Music, drawing on influences from cultures all over the world.  Other artists that can be associated with New Age in modern days include: Chakras are the various focal points in the subtle body used in a variety of ancient meditation practices, collectively denominated as Tantra, or the esoteric or inner traditions of Hinduism. It focuses on meditation and concentration on the mind, body, and soul. While the Chakra belief is based in Hinduism, there are equivalents in esoteric Buddhism as well. For starters, there are many different beliefs within the Chakra system, but for the sake of simplicity, we're gonna focus on the 7 Chakra system since that's primarily what most people think of when it comes to the Chakra aesthetic. If there is enough interest, we might get into the other chakra systems as well, but it's not necessary to help create the foundation for Chakrawave.  But all adhere to the same principle that as you unlock one chakra for your kundalini (literally, energy serpent), another one opens up until you reach the very top of the chakra system. The Zodiac relates to the star signs of the same name. There are many times of Zodiac systems dating back to many ancient cultures, but the 2 most popular ones are the Western Zodiac (determined by the time of year you were born in), followed by the Chinese Zodiac (determined by the actual year you were born in), like one could be a Virgo born year of the Rat, a Scorpio born year of the Dragon, a \"Double Ox\" (Taurus born year of the Ox), or a \"Double Cat\" (a Leo born year of the Tiger). For those of you who are curious about what the zodiac signs are, here's a breakdown of them: The Western Zodiac is broken down based on the particular time of year one is born in, which goes as follows: Furthermore, the Western Zodiac signs are broken down into the four traditional elements: The Western Zodiac aesthetics (yes, this could be considered a sort of aesthetic umbrella, but probably not enough to be able to create their pages like with some other aesthetic subgenres) tie directly into one's astrological sign and might incorporate the element their respective sign falls under. The Chinese Zodiac, unlike the Western Zodiac, is determined heavily by what year you were born, but it always runs in a cycle, which the order is as follows) Much like the Western Zodiac, the Chinese Zodiac also has their signs corresponding with the elements, though in this case, it has to do with the 5 Chinese Elements: Breaking it down even further, the signs can also fall into one of two categories; Yin or Yang. The Yin and Yang represent the duality of humanity, with the Yin representing the feminine, darkness, and passiveness while the yang represents the masculine, light, and activeness.

It typically draws upon local history, folklore, imagery, and values, often relating to Protestantism and the region's colonial period. It commonly features the supernatural, such as witches, ghosts, demons, the Devil, and other strange entities. Like other Regional Gothic aesthetics, its popularity resurged during the mid 2010s, with added aspects of liminal space and specifically formatted text posts, but it has origins in Dark Romantic literature of the early 19th century. “Shall we never never get rid of this Past? ... It lies upon the Present like a giant's dead body.”  ― Nathaniel Hawthorne, The House of the Seven Gables New England Gothic got a start as a literary tradition. The earliest known work of fiction containing ideas and imagery now associated with New England Gothic is “The Devil and Tom Walker” by Washington Irving (of \"Sleepy Hollow\" fame) first published in 1824.  Regarded as \"New England's Faust,\" in about 1727, the titular Tom Walker is met in a wooded swamp at the remains of an Indian fort by Old Scratch, who, taking a liking to Tom, offers to provide him with the nearby buried treasure of Captain Kidd, under certain conditions.  Though satirical in nature and now obscure, it and its author should not be disregarded, as Irving is said to have encouraged the likes of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allen Poe.[1] Hawthorne is the one credited with the creation of New England Gothic with his fiction, [2] starting with “Young Goodman Brown” in 1835.  Set in 17th Century Puritan New England, the titular Goodman Brown leaves his wife for a journey through a forest which takes a gloomy turn.  Hawthorne was troubled by and ashamed of his great-great-grandfather, John Hathorne, an instrumental judge in the Salem Witch Trials who never repented for his actions, and this shadow over Hawthorne is apparent throughout his works.  Hawthorne and Poe would, through their works, influence possibly the most well-recognized New England Gothic author, H.P. Lovecraft,[3] whose foray into New England Gothic is “The Terrible Old Man,” first published in 1921.  Set in a fictional seaside Massachusetts town, it centers around an attempted burglary of the very old house of a town resident \"so old that no one can remember when he was young,\" who, among other strange facts, is thought to have been a clipper ship's captain, and keeps stones with odd symbols on them on his property.  Lovecraft sought to break the Gothic molds of his time, and pioneered cosmic horror, fueled by his deep-seated xenophobia and using his native New England as a setting almost all the while. Through Lovecraft, New England Gothic became intertwined with cosmic horror and the Weird, and other pulp writers - with his encouragement - borrowed from his works to produce New England Gothic tales in similarly weird veins. Such writers include August Derleth, Henry Kuttner, and even Robert Bloch. Another important though underrepresented figure in New England Gothic’s development in literature is Shirley Jackson, starting with her controversial short story “The Lottery” in 1948, which depicts a brutal ritual in a contemporary small-town American community.  Though she was born and raised in California, Jackson eventually moved East. Her new home in North Bennington, Vermont, served as a recurrent backdrop for her Gothic stories, while the abuse she suffered, from her parents even after moving out and from her husband in marriage, as well as her ostracism from the surrounding community,[4] undoubtedly informed their substance. The works of Lovecraft and Jackson would go on to influence none other than Stephen King,[5] [6] who has been spawning New England Gothic tales of his own at least since his breakout novel Carrie, released in April of 1974. With the advent of film, New England Gothic began being depicted through a different medium.  It has been on screen since at least 1910, with the premier of The House of the Seven Gables, directed by J. Searle Dawley and starring Mary Fuller. [7] New England Gothic is noticeably lacking in music compared to other Regional Gothics, and New England's music tradition in general (with the possible exception of its repertoire of shanties and sea ballads) is small and limited compared to the South and the West. This is probably a symptom of the notions of the \"practical\" Yankee and the Puritan before them, as both devoted little time to the arts. Food associated with New England Gothic is largely the same as that associated with the New England aesthetic. Simple, inexpensive dishes are favorable. When the Regional Gothic Trend took off on Tumblr in early 2015, it produced specimens set in New England, albeit based on Southern Gothic clichés, effectively breathing new life into the aesthetic, but approaching it from a different angle. Though influential on New England Gothic and horror in general, the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft is criticized for the racist ideas recurrent throughout it.  There is no getting around that Lovecraft was a white supremacist, and his racist views are inseparable from his writing, but understanding this is important to understanding the power of his works. \"No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality...\" ― Shirley Jackson, The Haunting of Hill House (Film adaptations of New England Gothic novels and short stories are not counted here.  Many films here (especially those from the 1980s) are mostly horror that possess gothic elements and are adapted to a New England setting, or relate to the Salem Witch Trials in some way.) *Fascinatingly, while the novel the film is based on (Some Must Watch by Ethel Lina White) is set in then-contemporary England, the film adaptation is instead set in turn-of-the-century New England, in order to \"give it a more threatening gothic atmosphere.\"[8] https://new-england-gothic.tumblr.com/\n\nhttps://amorilinguae.tumblr.com/post/115911544134 https://8tracks.com/thedisplacedsoutherner/a-witch-among-us",

It was particularly prevalent from the 1960s to the 1970s in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela and to a lesser extent in Europe, principally in Spain. The origins of New Figuration are traced back to the 1950s, when Abstract Art and Expressionism were popular among artists from Spanish-speaking countries.\nAfter World War II, during the 1960s, artists from Latin-America lost interest for Informalism, Expressionism and traditional Abstract Art because their style wasn't enough to represent the current social distress or show the world a social or political message. This spawned a revival of Figurative Art, that would represent each country's social, political and economical situation. As this is a wiki for Aesthetics, the problems that happened in each country won't be explained in depth. In Argentina, Neo-Figurative artworks were mainly about the political situation of the country at the time. The president of Argentina (Juan Perón) was overthrown, and a new president was elected (Arturo Frondizi Ércoli), however he became corrupt and broke his promises, leading to massive waves of violent strikes throughout the country. Around the late 1950s, Argentina had really serious problems regarding its economy and national debt. In 1959, the supporters of the former president Juan Perón were planning a extremely violent revolt, however the police seized their weapons. \nArgentine New Figuration is associated with the Otra Figuración art movement, founded in 1961, which advocated for a Figurative art revival, as Abstract art (which was the current artistic trend at the time) didn't feature human figures to represent the current political situation of the country. In Colombia, Colombian artists used this style to challenge political oppression, and as a response to La Violencia, a Colombian civil war that lasted 10 years. Colombian New Figuration was heavily inspired by Cubism, rather than traditional Abstract Art. In Mexico, Neo-Figurative artworks were used as an response against Mexican Muralism; an art project by the Mexican government during the Mexican Revolution. In Venezuela, Neo-Figurative artworks were mainly about the militar regime in Venezuela that ended in 1958; and Venezuela's new democratic government which had socialist tendencies, upsetting many of the Venezuelan people. In Spain, Neo-Figurative artworks were mainly about Francisco Franco's dictatorship and the post-Spanish civil war period. Due to the Francoist regime, the media (including art, books, movies, etc.) was heavily censored, and many artworks had to be published in foreign countries where exiled Spaniards went for a better life. \nIn Spain, New Figuration was popular until 1965, when it was replaced by Narrative Figuration; a similiar artistic movement that also became popular in France and would use abstract and surrealistic elements to narrate stories (as the name implies). The visuals motifs of New Figuration are loosely defined, as they were meant to represent social and political problems in certain countries (such as wars, dictatorships, poverty, post-war trauma, etc.) However, the main motifs of the New Figuration visuals represent human bodies and abstract political messages, along with satirized representations of politicians and war, and other surrealistic elements. \"I would like my paintings to look as if a human being has passed through them, like a snail, leaving a trace of human presence and a trace of past events, like the snail leaving its slime.\" \n- Francis Bacon",

True New Money is earned through salary, business profits, and/or investments. Because of this, people with New Money can actually be much wealthier than those with Old Money, even as far as being billionaires. Unlike Old Money, it does not have an easily definable style, as New Money follows trends and is constantly changing. The youngest generation of an Old Money family (usually teenagers or young adults) might be closer to New Money due to conditions of inheritance and their desire to follow trends or rebel against their older relatives. It is important to note that some people may look New Money wealthy but are in reality middle class people attempting to look rich, which is Boujee. The idea of an aesthetic of the newly wealthy which is distinct from the established wealthy dates back to Ancient Greece. New Money is most visible during times of economic change, both extreme success and extreme poverty, with many people joining New Money circles during times of economic success and extreme spending being more notable during times of poverty. New Money is looked down upon by Old Money and Preppy people, usually for being attention seeking. Extreme loudness, thrill seeking, flashy jewelry, and spending sprees are also common among New Money. Those with New Money tend to fall under suspicion due to how quickly the person becomes successful. It may turn out that the money was earned in a less than legal way. In the 2010s, the Rich Kids of Instagram trend led to robberies as well as investigations into the finances of the \"Kids\" parents. New Money is difficult to define as an aesthetic. It is visually striking, which can manifest in several ways: Excessive amounts of gold and gold plated items, especially things that are not usually gold plated, like toilets. Food with gold leaf is popular. Versace is brand which uses this style. Many people consider it gaudy. This is the jet set lifestyle - private jets, yachts, vacations in Monaco. Visuals are similar to Boujee - gold, diamonds, expensive champagne. Males can exemplify the Playboy aesthetic. Most common among musicians and athletes. Think Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, wellness retreats, and New Age spiritualism. Feng Shui layout or modern Scandinavian design is used for decor. The color palette is light and airy: white, natural blonde wood, pale blue, light tan, gold, rose gold, and cream. Succulents are common. Color palette is neutral: gray, black, white, and tan, with primary colors used as accents, especially red. Furniture is usually mid-century modern and paintings and sculptures are Cubist. It is more masculine and common among men who made their money in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street. Often mistakenly called Preppy, this style a trendier version of Old Money. Think Cher in Clueless (1995). Most wealthy athletes, musicians, and politicians are New Money. Although it often said that New Money billionaires and millionaires are \"self made\" people, they hardly ever started from poverty, instead relying on loans from wealthy parents or investors to start up their businesses. The New Money aesthetic is popular in advertising, as it uses much more visible signs of wealth than other wealth related aesthetics like Old Money. Less obvious are the bohemian influenced (think Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop) and minimalist influenced New Money visuals. Fashion follows trends but it generally more revealing and sexy than Old Money styles. Local culture can drastically change fashion aesthetics - parts of California have a more bohemian vibe while Manhattan tends to be more Chic Modernist.

The aesthetic is principally based around light-skinned Latinas who are hyperfemenine and possibly high class, also taking inspiration from the traditional attire that female Spanish & Hispanic-American colonialists wore during the colonization of the Americas (particularly in what was known as \"New Spain\"), mixing it with Coquette-themed fashion. The main inspiration for this aesthetic was the Collection III by Mirror Palais, which included various extremely expensive dresses inspired by the Spanish colonial era[2]. Many of these dresses were handcrafted by Mexican artisans, and multiple of them quickly sold out. Then, another main inspiration was the Cruise 2024 collection by DIOR, and its clothing pieces included Oaxacan ruffles and looks inspired by the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. Women dressed up in this type of clothes usually post pictures of themselves near Catholic sites, like religious statues and candle altars in churches. Some elements commonly used in New Spanish Catholic Girl outfits include: Just like Tomato Girl, Scandi Girl, French It Girl, Winter Fairy Coquette and many others, New Spanish Catholic Girl is yet one of the many internet aesthetics that are heavily inspired by specific places, settings and nations. This type of aesthetics often face criticism online due to their romanticized portrayal of these places and cultures. Ethnic fetishization is also a problem in these online communities. The term \"Catholic Mexican Girl\" received heavy backlash due to its name. Many Mexican users on TikTok called out the trend because it was not an accurate portrayal of Catholic religion in Mexico, neither it was authentically Mexican, as it was rather a modern interpretation of Spanish Imperial fashion in the Americas. Many Latin-Americans argued that this aesthetic promoted a romanticized view on the Spanish colonial era and trivialized its consequences, ignoring the historical struggles and complex history of Mexico's independence, as well as the brutal history of Spanish colonialism in the Americas[3]. It was also criticized because it particularly focused on people with light skin, excluding the other Latin-American people who have darker skin tones.

Mostly seen paired with games from franchises/series like Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Pokémon, Kirby, Animal Crossing, Pikmin, and Metroid. Nintencore is most commonly associated with retro games, especially ones from the NES to Nintendo 64 eras (although others like the GameCube, Wii, and Nintendo Switch also fit the aesthetic). Things such as pixel art and chiptune music are very common tropes. Due to the variety of different genres and art-styles seen in multiple games, you could arguably branch Nintencore into multiple groups (RPGs, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Smash Bros., etc.) Nintencore music is a broadly defined music genre that fuses chiptune and video game music with modern hardcore punk, heavy metal, and various associated rock music style frequently features the use of electric guitars, drum kits, and typical rock instrumentation alongside synthesizers, chiptunes, 8-bit sounds, and electronically produced beats. It originated out of a diverse range of musical styles, including various forms of hardcore punk and heavy metal. (The Japanese Synthpop/City Pop band YMO could be considered one of the major inspirations.) In addition to these origins, notable Nintencore bands have been influenced by a variety of other genres, such as post-hardcore, metalcore, electro, noise rock, post-rock, and screamo. Thus, Nintencore groups vary stylistically. Horse the Band combines metalcore, heavy metal, thrash metal, and post-hardcore with post-rock passages. \"The Black Hole\" from Horse the Band's third album, The Mechanical Hand, is an example of Nintencore, featuring screamed vocals, heavy \"Nintendo riffs,\" and \"sound effects from numerous games.\" Math the Band includes electro and dance-punk styles. Minibosses use Kyuss-inspired heavy metal riffing, and The Advantage is associated with styles such as noise rock and post-rock. The Depreciation Guild was an indie band that incorporated 8-bit sounds, video game music, and elements of shoegaze. Some bands feature singing, such as The Depreciation Guild, whose frontman Kurt Feldman provides \"ethereal\" and \"tender vocals,\" and The Megas, who write lyrics that mirror video game storylines. Others, such as Horse the Band and Math the Band, add screamed vocals into the mix. But yet other groups are strictly instrumental, such as Minibosses, and The Advantage. While otherwise diverse, all Nintencore groups \"use specific instruments to mimic the sounds of Nintendo games.\" TV",

It began in the late 70s and fizzled out in early 80s, although later groups carried on the legacy after the original scene by adopting the aesthetic and a similar approach to music The term was coined during the creation of the split album \"No New York\"[1] No Wave reacts angst the commercialization of rock music in the 70s by trying to make it as uncommercially viable as possible.[1] It achieved this by using elements such as atonality, dissonance, non-unified tempos, abrasiveness, angularity, buzzing guitars and skronk, tribal drumming, etc[2] with vocal delivery that sounds really anxious and often off-key (Assuming the song even has a key). The idea was that anybody could pick up a guitar and make something interesting with it if they were creative enough, even if they have no knowledge of the instrument or music theory. The first pioneer in the scene was the synth-punk duo \"Suicide\" consisting of Alan Vega and Martin Rev in the mid 70s. While their sound was a bit different the bands that followed, they laid down the key elements and motifs that other no wave artists would follow The scene really kicked off around 1978 when DNA, Theoretical Girls, and Teenage Jesus & The Jerks were formed, with other bands soon following. In 1978, Brian Eno was in new york city to produce the talking head's 2nd album when he saw the bands playing and wanted to document the strange music he heard. So he invited 4 of the bands to Big Apple Studio to produce the split album \"No New York\" which became the de facto no wave album in the original scene.[3] The most notable performance of no wave music was the music festival \"Noise Fest\" which was conducted by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth at the White Columns art space in June 1981. Each night 3 to 5 acts performed including Glenn Branca, Rhys Chatham, Jeffrey Lohn, Dog Eat Dog, Built on Guilt, Rudolph Grey, the Avant Squares, Mofungo, Red Decade, Robin Crutchfield's Dark Day, Ad Hoc Rock, Smoking Section, Chinese Puzzle, Avoidance Behavior, and Sonic Youth.[4] By 1982 almost all of the bands in the original scene had disbanded. Bands after the original scene such as Sonic Youth and The Swans took heavy inspiration from the original no wave scene and created their own take on the style (Especially in their early music) albeit relatively more melodic than the previous no wave scene. The had genre also had an influence on noise and industrial bands in the coming years such as Big Black, Lev Six, Helmet, and Live Skull[5] The no wave scene also bleed into local cinema and visual arts No wave fashion took a more satirically \"Professional\" approach to fashion of punk.

The word first appeared in webcomic Templar, Arizona before 2009 and was later employed by K-Hole, a trend forecasting group, in an October 2013 report called \"Youth Mode: A Report on Freedom\". As used by K-Hole, \"normcore\" refers to an attitude, not a particular code of dress. It was intended to mean \"finding liberation in being nothing special.\" However, an influential February 2014 piece in New York magazine conflated it with what K-Hole terms \"Acting Basic\", a concept under which dressing neutrally is a means to avoiding standing out. This broader sense of \"normcore\" as referring to understated and noncommittal attitudes to fashion gained popular usage. At the same time, many cultural references that are tied to broadly neutral fashion aesthetics, such as the characters featured on the television series Seinfeld, also exemplify to a significant extent the ethos of normcore in the more radical sense proposed by K-Hole. Normcore was the name of a fictional population in the webcomic \"Templar, Arizona\", starting after the webcomic began in 2005 and recognized sometime before 2009, where its first Urban Dictionary definition was added on March 27th, describing normcore as \"a subculture based on conscious, artificial adoption of things that are in widespread use, proven to be acceptable, or otherwise inoffensive.\" It was also was named runner-up for neologism of the year by the Oxford University Press in 2014. This interpretation of normcore fluctuated wildly in the years after the definition, with some taking it as a source of pride and \"anti-stature\", while others used the term mockingly. The beginning of its rise was trend forecasting group K-HOLE's \"Youth Mode\" report, which heavily contrasted generational views of individuality and its connected ideas with consumerism and exclusivity (or lack thereof) by \"understand[ing] the process of differentiation from a nonlinear perspective ... In Normcore, one does not pretend to be above the indignity of belonging.\" K-HOLE's analysis was impactful in bringing normcore to mainstream attention. \"Youth Mode\" and its focus on normcore was reported on by several publications, such as The Cut, Lucky Mag and Fashionista. Bullett described normcore as \"like the smiley face emoticon ... inclusive, basic, and human; an invitation to engage.\" At the same time, widespread dissemination of normcore throughout the popular press tended to progressively emphasized the superficial markers it shares with Acting Basic, leading to a set of fashion prescriptions that were both consumeristic (since brand names are one prominent way of standing out while in blank, basic fashion) and facile, leading many commentators (such as Gawker, which reacted with \"lol, indeed.\") to mockingly dismiss it. As analyzed by K-Hole, normcore is less about a specific set of fashion statements, but about blending in and allowing oneself to belong. Therefore in many circles, normcore is associated within pop culture, with inventing memes, liking mainstream things (Marvel movies, for example), enjoying popular pop bands and choosing the most basic character in any given video game (choosing Mario in Mario Party is a very normcore thing to do.) On the other hand, K-Hole claims that in Williamsburg (a gentrified New York neighborhood with many creative professionals and attitudes, somewhat comparable to the Portland depicted in Portlandia) it's normcore to be a hipster. Therefore many of the specific visual, fashion, consumer and intellectual prescriptions of normcore are heavily contextual: for example, peanut butter is normcore for many Americans, but if it's not easily found in your area (and you're not in a wealthy social milieu where importing random foods is commonplace), then going out of your way to emulate it is antithetical to normcore. Therefore, the following examples are influenced by the general experiences of the wiki editors, which should match that of most readers; but it doesn't mean that you have to emulate them to be normcore, nor that emulating them makes you normcore. Normcore visuals are hard to define as they revolve around being basic and normal The Normcore aesthetic visuals tend to include: Normcore is characterized first and foremost as a fashion aesthetic. Normcore wearers are people who do not wish to distinguish themselves from others by their clothing. This is not to mean that they are unfashionable people who wear whatever comes to hand, but that they consciously choose clothes that are undistinguished – except, frequently, for a highly visible label to impart prestige. The \"normcore\" trend has been interpreted as a reaction to fashion oversaturation, resulting from ever faster-changing fashion trends. Normcore clothes include everyday items of casual wear, such as plain T-shirts, sport jackets, baseball caps, straight jeans, chinos and sneakers, are typical apparel, but not items such as neckties or blouses. These clothes are worn by men and women alike, making normcore a unisex style. Clothes that meet the \"normcore\" description are mainly sold by large fashion and retail chains such as The Gap, Uniqlo, Jack & Jones, Superdry, Jigsaw, Kirkland, and Esprit. They are generally cheaply produced in East Asian countries. Many other retailers, such as Marc O'Polo, Woolrich, Desigual, Closed and Scotch & Soda produce normcore-like clothes, combined with individual design ideas. An example of this aesthetic is the wardrobe on \"Seinfeld\", or, more recently, \"The Middle\". External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

The art is made from several political points of view, including but not limited to Unionism, Ulster loyalism and Irish Republicanism. Rarely, some murals may have no political affiliation. \nGenerally, as they represent the history of The Troubles, they also use political and historical symbology representing the groups and political factions, which were or still are active in the area, the British royalty, the soldiers of a specific conflict, etc. Sometimes the murals may also honor and remember the people who passed away during terrorist attacks in the area, or people who fought for their faction during The Troubles (either loyalist Irish republican). From a cultural context, Northern Ireland is home to some of the best propagandistic art in the world due to its recent history. Many of the most famous political murals in Europe can be found in the Northern Irish cities of Belfast and Derry. Over 2000 murals have been made in Northern Ireland since the 1970s. The most well-known mural is possibly the Bobby Sands in Belfast. Another well known touristic attraction in West Belfast includes the International Wall[1] (also called solidarity wall or Peace Wall), where many murals can be found, representing not only Irish issues but international ones and solidarity for other like-minded movements.  \nThe first Northern Irish Muralist artwork can be traced back to 1908 when various Ulster loyalists portrayed William of Orange on a white horse to promote Orange identity in Ulster. Irish Republican paintings on murals started appearing in the 1970s. Originally they were only supossed to represent the Irish reunification movement, however they became more radical after the IRA group got more serious about its political labor in Northern Ireland. This artistic practice has been conserved and nowadays is considered part of Northern Irish urban culture and symbology. As it surged as a form of political expression, Northern Irish Muralism is closely related to the political, historical and social context of Northern Ireland. The murals reflect the deep divisions between the two main communities in Northern Ireland: the unionist/loyalist community, which identifies with Britishness and wishes to remain part of the United Kingdom, and the nationalist/republican community, which seeks a united Ireland independent from British rule. Because of this, the murals often represent key political figures of each side, key historical events during The Troubes, and symbols associated with each community, including flags, symbology, coats of arms and other national symbols. Some murals might also completely reject the conflict of Ireland and instead represent solidarity for other political movements or promote pacifism.   \nBecause of this, visual elements in the murals often act as representatives of history of The Troubles, and therefore they visually narrate historical interpretations and fuel cultural/political identity. Sometimes they are also used to mark territory, as Republican neighborhoods are more likely to have Republican murals and viceversa. Also, as they visually narrate some key moments of Irish history, they have become a touristic attraction.",

It was characterized by its representation of everyday objects of everyday life at the time, and the representation of contemporary life through an Realistic point of view and Figurative Art. As such, some objects commonly featured in New Realist artworks include 60s advertising, rubbish imagery and objects, and piles of trash, given new artistic meanings. This movement was also influenced by the other popular Avant-garde movements of the time, such as Abstract Expressionism, Dadaism or Pop Art, but didn't ideologically fully agree and instead focused on the representation of the physical world. Some have described this art movement as the \"French counterpart of American Pop Art\". The art critic Pierre Restany described the art movement as «a poetic recycling the urban, industrial and advertising of the everyday world». The roots of the movement can be traced back to the Lettrism art movement during thew 1940s, also of French origin. \nPierre Restany published the First manifesto of the New Realism in April, 1960. \nThe Nouveau Réalisme movement was officially founded in the October of 1960 by a group of French artists, whose members were Yves Klein, Arman, Francois Dufrêne, Raymond Hains, Pierre Restany, Daniel Spoerri, Jean Tinguely and Jacques Villeglé, and multiple other artists who later joined the movement. In the year 1961, the artists César, Mimmo Rotella, Niki de Saint Phalle and Gérard Deschamps joined the movement. The artist Christo joined the group in 1963. \nThe group's aim was to create an sociological aesthetic that depicted everyday life in an unidealized way. Therefore, their works usually incorporated everyday objects and materials, such as household items, clothing, and found objects, which were depicted realistically and in a unromanticized manner. \nBecause of this, the term \"Noveau Réalisme\" (New Realism) became subject of criticism within the group, because there was technically nothing \"new\" (nouveau) about it, and some artists preferred the term \"Réalisme d'Aujourd'hui (Today's Realism). \nThe New Realist artists saw life \"as an image\", and therefore they wanted to take fundamental parts of life and incorporate them into their artworks, with the purpose to \"unite life and art\". \nThe first New Realism exposition took place in November (1960) in the Avant-garde festival of Paris. Additionally, some of their works were anonymously publicized in Paris. \nThe movement started to lose revelance in the 1970s. The Nouveau Réalisme movement used a wide variety of styles and techniques, since the point of the movement was to break with traditional art styles and explore new forms to depict and represent everyday life, such as rejecting Romanticism. Since the movement emphasized on representing life realistically, one of the key characteristics of this movement was the use of everyday objects and materials. New Realist artists would often incorporate household objects, advertisements from the 1960s, trash, discarded items, and textures on their works, as it would go against society's common perception of what beauty and art is and isn't.  \nA popular technique used in New Realist art was Assemblage, which consists on creating new artworks by mixing different objects and materials into one. This would give the artworks an unconventional and chaotic aura, since it clashed with the common definition of beauty. \nAlong with this, another important aspect of Nouveau Réalisme was the incorporation of unconventional materials and tactics, such as the use of plastics, industrial materials and even fire.",

It involves gas masks, hazardous items, hazmat suits, and lands in ruins. The aesthetic is usually historical, specifically being based around the 1980s due to the large amount of nuclear power being built during the time as well as the ongoing cold war making nuclear warfare a constant fear. Modern nuclear aesthetic is more centered around urban exploration of abandoned nuclear sites, due to the end of the cold war and decline of nuclear power. Nuclear aesthetic is based of the operation of Nuclear reactors, which uses complicated control panels and equipment used to start off nuclear fission and containing it to prevent a critical disaster, it is also based around the storage, safeguarding and disposal of fissile materials. It can also be based around the themes of industrial nuclear disaster, with NBC and Hazmat suits, geiger counters and other complex equipment with post-apocalyptic environments such as abandoned cities, old buildings/cars and contaminated areas. Also, nuclear aesthetic can be based around nuclear warfare such as the storage and launching of nuclear weaponry, political power and propaganda, test sites, command bunkers etc. Nuclear fashion is based on safety from dangerous radiation, utilizing gas masks and hazmat suits or boring office clothing, depending on the situation.",

It takes a lot of the elements from it and Vaporwave, but has a darker air and color palette applied to it than the usually colorful palette associated with the other two for its visual medium in exchange for a more restricted color palette of blacks, greys, and muted blues. The music itself takes a lot of inspiration from early Vaporwave, drone, Nu-Metal, and Grunge, and does have some similarities to Witch House, but while Witch House has more of a spooky and ethereal air to it, Ocean Grunge tends to be hollow and depressing but still carries the ocean/sea motif its cousin genre carries. Ocean Grunge aesthetics can also tap into the aesthetics of the deep ocean, including sunken ships and the aquatic creatures of the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean abyss, both realistic and surreal. If Ocean Grunge happens to take a trip under the sea, however, a lot of yellows, whites, blacks, and dark blues and purples, create a slightly richer color palette. Ocean Grunge tends to borrow a lot visuals from Seapunk. But rather than the rich, vibrant colors one often sees associated with that particular genre, it tends to be more monochromatic, utilizing lots of blacks, greys, and muted blues. These colours reflect the cold, dark, deep empty feeling one would feel being stranded in the middle of the ocean with no land in sight and slowly losing all hope of rescue coming to save you before ultimately plunging into the ocean depths below. Musically, Ocean Grunge has a tendency to have a droning, melancholic sound to it (much like regular Grunge) and has a heavy element of nihilism to its overall aesthetic; like when one first reads on the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzche and really hasn't taken into account the nuances associated with such a philosophy. Musicians in the genre include: Ocean Grunge music tends to be ambient in nature and, while earlier examples of Ocean Grunge incorporated samples of Grunge music, it has involved to incorporate elements of orchestral and dark synth-pop music as well. Examples of this newer style of Ocean Grunge music include: Ocean Grunge has been incorporated by artists for food presentation. The use of Ocean Grunge has been observed with food preparations of seafood and desserts.",

It has no official name aside from being frequently referred to as the \"2000s emo art style\". The style was initially characteristic of popular Emo communities (and later the Emo subgenre of Scene) communities before bleeding into general alternative and mainstream internet spaces. The art style itself is also heavily associated with the animated television series Invader Zim due to its scene influence, and with the rise of anime culture in the 2010s, Japanese shows featuring dark alternative culture such as Death Note became popular references and inspirations for the art style's developing anime-inspired appeal by the turn of the deacade. The style is characterized by its often sketchy line art. This may be to mimic traditional pencil drawings, or to create a jagged, edgy feel to the artwork. The proportions of the characters were usually thin or stick figured bodies with caricature-like heads and large eyes, comparable to the likes of Tim Burton. The large circular eyes are additionally reminiscent of chibi designs of 2000s Japanese TV shows. The character designs mimicked 2000s and early 2010s fashion trends. Low waisted bottoms, straightened opaque high-volume hair, and striped patterns were very popular at the time.",

It's meant to draw you into a time before and forget about the current things happening, back into a time where everything felt simpler. The Old Hollywood period was the beginning of the Sound Era: when silent movies faded out of the spotlight as the industry transitioned to sound-film production. The beginning of the Sound Era isn't exactly set in concrete. Some think of it as when the movie The Jazz Singer was released in 1927, which was the first full movie with synchronized dialogue, while some see it as 1929, the official end of the Silent Era. Old Hollywood movies adhered to strict set of genres: Western, comedic, musical, and biography, sometimes multiple at once. The movies have linear timelines that leave no room for speculation, except when a character has a flashback, and the problems are always solved at the end (one of the reasons people are drawn to this aesthetic). Fashion from the old Hollywood days include: Makeup was minimal but bold, dark lips and thin eyebrows were popular. You can get pieces like these from vintage/thrift stores, there are also lots of sewing patterns on Etsy. There are also many later movies, set in or pay homage to the era:",

Old Money refers to people who have inherited their wealth instead of working for it. In the United States, Old Money is associated with WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) culture, and in Europe, Old Money is associated with titles of nobility. Old Money is most prominent in countries where there was no aristocracy but instead an elite social class held a  status nearly equal to an aristocracy. In the United States, the oldest Old Money families are the ones which can trace their ancestry back to the passengers on the Mayflower. Other families are considered Old Money when they can trace their ancestry back to the founders of a prestigious town such as New York City, for example the fictional van der Woodsens in Gossip Girl, who are descendants of Dutch settlers in New York. The Social Register, a list of the wealthiest and most influential American families was first published in 1887. Some major cities have their own versions of the Social Register. In recent times, it has become less of an indicator of Old Money pedigree. In the 1930s, Old Money families traced their wealth back to at least the American Revolution. Those who had gained wealth around the time of the American Civil War and during the Gilded Age, were not yet considered Old Money. Today, families whose wealth dates back only to the Gilded Age are considered Old Money. Blue Blood is a term used to refer to people descended from nobility. Although not all Old Money families have Blue Blood, a family with Blue Blood is more likely to be Old Money than not. In 1844, the phrase The Upper Ten was used to refer to the 10,000 richest people in New York City. During the Gilded Age, The Four Hundred was used to refer to the four hundred wealthiest families in New York City. The list included the Astors and the Vanderbilts. Many Old Money families are also WASPs (white Anglo-Saxon Protestants). The Boston Brahmin, First Families of Virginia, and Old Philadelphians are location-based terms for Old Money groups in the US. They refer to the Old Money families from Boston, Virginia and Philadelphia, whose ancestors were the founders of that respective city or state. Posh is a term most used in Great Britain to mean a wealthy, upper class person, although the term includes both Old Money and new money. It has spread to other English-speaking locations. This aesthetic can be described as very sophisticated and classy. The visuals indict wealth and history. The key is understated elegance. The clothes may appear plain or boring, but they are high quality. Old Money fashion is sometimes confused with Prep, but the color palette is more muted, and black and purple are used. In recent times, the terms \"stealth wealth\" and \"quiet luxury\" have been used to describe the Old Money aesthetic. The terms were first used to describe the clothing worn by characters on the television show Succession, however, these characters are not part of a true Old Money family. In March 2023, Gwyneth Paltrow was praised for her elegant, understated clothing worn for her court appearances. Media focusing on Old Money tends to contrast the wealth of the lifestyle with darker themes like murder, tragic deaths, depression, and drug and alcohol abuse. Characters often have difficultly expressing real emotions due to not being shown the love of a parent during childhood. Another common element is the conflict between Old Money characters and New Money, or Nouveau Riche, characters. Media often centers around conflict with individuals who were not born into pedigreed families and made their fortunes recently, such as on Wall Street or in show business. Old Money characters often look down on New Money because of their ostentatious displays of wealth, and use it as evidence as to why their money is inferior.",

Vamp themes can be traced back to the likes of Spaceghostpurrp, debatably the first vamp rapper, but was popularized by Lil Tracy (aka Yung Bruh/souljawitch) in the late 2010s. The first large leap in popularity resulted from Playboi Carti's 'Whole Lotta Red,' which explored the 'punk' influence and leaned into a darker sound, with visual themes including gothic and Satanist imagery. Opium merges strong alternative influences with high fashion and avant-garde by the likes of brands such as Rick Owens, Balenciaga and Maison Margiela, as well as a heavy focus on drug usage, promiscuity, fame and money making. In the early 2020s, Ken Carson and Destroy Lonely, arguably two of the most notable figures, would see musical success and subsequently be signed to Playboi Carti's Music Label; 'Opium' closely followed by Homixide Gang (consisting of Homixide Beno and Meechie), derived from opiate usage as a theme. Their songs feature lyrical themes of drug use, crime, sex, money and fashion and a distorted, electronic sound. The largest jump in popularity of the aesthetic can be attributed to Destroy Lonely's 'If Looks Could Kill', a single which was leaked in 2022. 'If Looks Could Kill' going viral on TikTok made the Vamp look more of a household fashion statement. Opium fashion is a subgenre of streetwear and typically features an all or mostly black theme, high fashion and avant garde fashion. notable brands include: Rick Owens, Balenciaga, Maison Margiela, Chrome Hearts, Givenchy, Vetements, Raf Simons and ALYX. Clothes with distorted or exaggerated proportions are typical, with both extremely baggy and extremely slim silhouettes worn. Many shirts and hoodies feature ironic and sometimes distasteful or bizarre slogans, and leather or black denim pants and jackets. There are also many metal and punk influences such as studded belts, metallic/silver accents (e.g. silver chains, silver detailing), and influences of horrorcore imagery such as blood and skeletons. Common imagery is that of churches, pentagrams, bats, wolves, night time and darkness, black cats, blood, bones and skeletons.

The interactions between East and West brought on by colonialist exploration have had an impact on aesthetics. Because of being something rare and new to Westerners, some non-European styles were really appreciated during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Because of not fully understanding the origins and principles that govern these exotic aesthetics, Europeans sometimes created hybrids of the style which they tried to replicate and which were the trends at that time.  Because traveling to China or other Far Eastern countries was something hard at that time and so remained mysterious to most Westerners, European imagination were fuelled by perceptions of Asia as a place of wealth and luxury, and consequently patrons from emperors to merchants vied with each other in adorning their living quarters with Asian goods and decorating them in Asian styles. Where Asian objects were hard to obtain, European craftsmen and painters stepped up to fill the demand, creating a blend of Rococo forms and Asian figures, motifs and techniques. Because of them being something rare and new to Westerners, these non-European styles were seen as exotic and interesting. Over time, different countries were popularized in various movements of Orientalism during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. For example, Japonism arose around 1860 when Japan opened itself up to trade, causing Ukiyo-e prints and other Japanese art to begin a craze as they were exported to Europe. During the middle ages, European countries were spending a large amount of money on importing silk, carpets, and porcelain as the Ottoman Empire and China had a monopoly on these products. By the 17th century, European craftsmen stepped up to fill the demand and figured out how to create these products as well, and started producing them with Oriental designs. This culminated in Rococo Chinoiserie where imiations of Chinese porcelain and lacquer were heavily used, creating a blend of Rococo forms with Asian figures, motifs and techniques. Over time, these Oriental designs produced by Europe shifted away from their traditional styles as more European elements were included.[1] Because traveling to China or other Far Eastern countries was something hard at that time and so remained mysterious to most Westerners, European imagination were fueled by perceptions of Asia as a place of wealth and luxury, and consequently patrons from emperors to merchants vied with each other in adorning their living quarters with Asian goods and decorating them in Asian styles. The interactions between East and West brought on by colonialist exploration have had an large impact on Orientalism as it was used for economic reasons. Orientalism worked as propaganda that arose alongside France and Britain's conflict with and eventual colonization of the Ottoman Empire. The main orientalist aesthetic of this period is Arabian Nights as the Arab countries being colonized were aestheticized. Modern aesthetics based around Asian cultures, such as Cyberpunk, are sometimes described as being a part of Orientalism, although due to the negative connotations of Orientalism this is usually only done to criticize the aesthetic. For example, Cyberpunk portrays the capitalism and urban sprawl of Hong Kong and Tokyo, but this may be a shallow view of those cities. More Information: Wikipedia:Orientalism (book) Orientalism was most famously criticized by Edward W. Said in his book \"Orientalism\" for being tied to the political goals of imperialism and prejudiced against the depicted people.[2] This book has popularized criticism of Orientalism and led to many other books being written on the subject, making Orientalism possibly the most debated aesthetic.

The videos often use a really random and exaggerated type of comedy. It was popular during the 2010s Internet era and it was initially pioneered by Doujin circles during the early 2000s, and later became popularized through the video platform Nico Nico Douga. OtoMAD videos also gained some notoriety outside Japan through YouTube reuploads, and western OtoMAD creators like MowtenDoo, or the Chinese video platform BiliBili, where these types of videos are known as \"鬼畜\"[1], roughly translating to \"Ghost animal\". The main idea behind OtoMAD videos is to take pre-existing content and try to make something as creative as possible out of it. Some of the most common media used in the genre includes anime, Japanese advertisements, memes that were popular in Japan and sometimes Western memes, video games, Gachimuchi wrestlers, etc[2]. Many people consider OtoMAD to be a form of transformative art, just like Black-Holed Memes or Nouveau Réalisme. The term \"OtoMAD\" literally translates to \"Sound MAD\" in Japanese, since the this meme style is derived from the MAD film genre (movies completely crafted from pre-existing material). To put it simple, \"OtoMAD\" focuses on the music, while \"MAD Movies\" focus on the films themselves. Some visuals commonly seen in OtoMAD videos include: Since OtoMAD edits are unseparable from the music played in the videos, there are many songs associated with the genre, particularly video game OSTs and J-Core, Denpa/Akiba-Pop, Doujin musical works or Japanese Eurobeat music.

        "description": "Disclaimer: Chicanos/Mexican-Americans may be uncomfortable with Non-Chicanos adopting this identity as an aesthetic. Pachucos were targeted and faced xenophobic and racist hate crimes in the United States because they were easily recognized by their clothing. Also, the Pachuco and Pachuca identities were closely tied with Chicano right's movements. Therefore, if any non-Chicanos adopt this identify as an aesthetic, it will be cultural appropriation. Please be respectful of Chicano/Mexican-American culture, and feel free to discuss. Pachuco refers to a subculture of Chicanos and Mexican-Americans, associated with zoot suits, street gangs, nightlife, and flamboyant public behavior. Pachuca is the female counterpart, often idealized as a beautiful Chicana woman in extravagant evening dress or a female version of the zoot suit, out with a pachuco boyfriend for a night on the town. Pachucas broke taboos of their time by wearing men's-style pants sometimes and appearing in public often with their pachuco boyfriends; at the time, a \"good woman\" was considered to have her place in the home. Pachucos became known for their distinguished look, dialogue, and actions. Pachucos dressed in recognizable Zoot suits, and often styled their hair into ducktails. Things like decorative chains and tattoos were also sometimes part of the pachuco look. The unique speech of pachucos was a very important element of their defined style. Consisting of creative phrases and some English words, Caló (Chicano) was a very popular form of speech among pachucos.",

As the name suggests, it is characterized by a pastel color palette as well as a fluffy or floaty appearance. When not refering to the fashion on its own, the term \"fancy\" (ファンシー) is commonly used within Japan to describe its nostalgic aesthetic. Fairy Kei visuals include: Fairy Kei is centered around muted pastels and 80's revivalist cartoons and motifs such as My Little Pony G1, Care Bears, Rainbow Brite, vintage 80's Barbie, etc. The look is very much a ‘fantasy style’, emulating the worlds of 80's girls’ cartoons and early shoujo manga. It began with Tavuchi, founder of the vintage and repurposed vintage boutique SPANK!, as her personal style, and then the look took off from there. Fabric is usually lightweight for dresses and skirts, such as the loose A-line dresses and the fluttery colored petticoats. Thick, fluffy sweaters, over-sized 80's sweatshirts; this is also the land from whence comes the mokomoko accessories craze, and stuffed animals are sewn onto sweaters and scarves, or as the usual purse. Dress length can be ankle length, knee-length or mini-skirt length; anything fluttery and flowy works. The most important aspects of fairy kei are the vintage/fantasy world factor, and the color palette. Color is one of the most important features here, less so the structure or item. Pastels and neon-tinted pastels, or high-saturated pastels. Popular colors are pastel pink, baby blue, lavender, light yellow and in smaller doses, ‘white-with-black-dots’. Dark and overly bright colors are not allowed outside of accents. Several motifs and themes are often found in fairy kei as well: most notably the unicorn, followed by kittens, any vintage 80's toy or franchise, moons and stars, rainbows, and naturally sweets such as cotton candy and conversation hearts (the chalky American candy that say things like UR CUTE). This substyle of fairy kei has a focus on outer space (uchuu) and space alien (uchuujin) motifs. The outfits combine the typical pastel look with flurescent colors and artificial/PVC materials. The make-up can be anything from simple to very colorful and often features unusual lipstick colors. Accessories often include space helmets, fluffies/vinyl legwarmers, headbands and futuristic headphones. Vendors Party Kei is a fashion style created by Canadian YouTuber Jillian Vessey (Pixielocks), inspired by Japanese street fashion. There is considerable confusion over what this style truly entails: its first stages as drawn out by Vessey were similar to both Larme and Cult Party Kei, with delicate clothes in pastel colors and motifs related to birthday parties. However, the style mutated in the following years: Vessey and her fanbase, the \"Confetti Club\", now wear louder garments from Western brands such as Lazy Oaf, with the previous party references becoming more overt and rainbows used as a common motif. Since Vessey is not Japanese or a fluent speaker of the corresponding language, her use of the Kei suffix has been subject to controversy, as its most used for fashion styles and trends hailing from the specific Harajuku locale, while Party Kei fashion is now almost entirely made up of Western brands. Vessey and her fanbase are frequently targeted and discussed in gossip forums like lolcow.farms, where the style has been negatively criticized for its inconsistent aesthetic. Additionally, some people believe this aesthetic is \"forced\" because Vessey has been trying to promote it for a long time. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

While pastel color palettes are a defining aspect of the aesthetic, it also revolves around having a passion for learning and studying, especially the arts and literature. The aesthetic is somewhat less mature and more child-like than other academic aesthetics, with value placed on optimism, positive outlooks on life, and adventuring. Visually, Pastel Academia draws inspiration from East Asian and European cultures, mixing them with modern and pastel themes to form the aesthetic. The aesthetic was created by the pastelacademia instagram, and gained a large following because of the social medias and wiki page. Pastel Academia is another variation of the 'Academia' aesthetic. What makes Pastel Academia different from other Academia aesthetics is that it is very clear and easily identifiable. Pastel Academia focuses on having a passion for learning, exploring, and studying. Like other academia aesthetics, Pastel Academia is about finding romanticism in education and learning new things. Unlike the more popular variation, Dark Academia, people who identify with Pastel Academia are more life-loving. They find happiness and peace in the little things like hanging out with a small group of friends or going to small cafés early in the morning, similar to people identifying with Light Academia. What makes them stand out the most, though, is their child-like and more immature personality than other variants. They are optimistic, hopelessly romantic, curiosity-driven, young-at-heart individuals. This is not to be associated with them infantilizing themselves (to be discussed later in more detail). Pastel Academia stands out when compared to other academia personalities(the elephant in the room, if you will). Pastel Academia visuals are heavily inspired by European and East Asian cultures and the environment. For example, the architecture of European-style buildings, specifically universities like Oxford and places like Alnwick Castle, along with countryside and outskirt environments of Japanese provinces such as Chichibu, Shirakawa, and many more. However, if you live somewhere where there isn't much to explore, you're still encouraged to go out and explore places. Look for secret gems in the urban city and create your own homely Pastel Academia environment. Cute cafés and secret studying spots are also a huge part of Pastel Academia. Having a cozy space to study in and having cute supplies - like washi tape and personalized notebooks - are also part of Pastel Academia. Cute supplies are just supplies that are supposed to help people study more; this means that they don't have to be expensive. Pastel Academia isn't limited to people who can afford expensive school supplies. When they are procrastinating on their studies, pastel academics enjoy partaking in creative hobbies which help them calm down or play the role as a beacon of productivity and calmness. This can include journaling, painting, drawing, biking, knitting, crochet, playing an instrument, cooking, watching series and movies, editing, photography, and much  more. The following media have some kind of relation to Pastel Academia, mostly in terms of visuals or themes (i.e., school settings), but also in their prevalence in the community. While Pastel Academia does not have it's own specific genre of music, certain genres such as K-pop, Lo-Fi, soft ballads, soft pop, and movie/musical soundtracks are popular among members of the community. Typically, music associated with the aesthetic can be enjoyed while studying, similar to other academic aesthetics. Pastel Academia fashion focuses on comfort and pastel colors. A common form of the style takes inspiration from school uniforms (both real and anime) and recreates the silhouette with a pastel color palette in order to suit the aesthetic, as well as adding cute motifs and accessories. Casual outfits in pastel colors are often seen in the aesthetic as well, however. Makeup is not often seen as the focus of the fashion, so light and natural looks are common. The two main aspects in almost every aesthetic is the ideals, personality and the visuals. There could be controversy in the future about this aesthetic being too \"childish\" to the point where people label it as infantilising. In no way shape or form is the intention of this aesthetic to attract or entertain pedophiles or imitate children. There is a huge difference between enjoying what society labels as 'childish' things and infantilising yourself to entertain adults. Pastel Academia stands for people who never or rarely got to experience being young, even if it's a time in their life they miss. Whether it's part of their personality or something that was developed throughout their life due to their environment, the innocence of this aesthetic is solely to give those people a safe space where they can express their love for studying arts, literature, and much more while standing up to people who tell them to \"act their age\" just because they are passionate about certain things like going on picnics, pastel colours and collecting things that make them happy. There is no place in this community for individuals who infantilize themselves for the pleasure of pedophiles, incels, and others. The Pastel Academia subculture is inclusive of people from all walks of life. Any race, gender, sexuality, and spirituality are welcomed here. People who marginalise and discriminate against other people are not welcomed in this subculture by any means. Respect is the number one ideology of this subculture. We do not associate with people who claim to be of this subculture but chose to harm and inflict any kind of disrespect onto others for any reason. We aren't immature in the sense that we act like children, but in our interests and hobbies. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

It may replace creepier Gore elements like organs or blood with candy and slime, and ocasionally it may use elements of Body Horror. Pastel Gore is influenced by Gurokawa and Pastel Goth fashion and it has various subgenres, including Candy Gore. The aesthetic was at its peak during the late 2010s and it was especially popular among Gen Z tweens and teens, forming online communities in platforms such as Amino, Tumblr and the former Sony Sketch. Examples of the Pastel Gore aesthetic may include graphic imagery like blood, guts and all sorts of gore (playing into the macabre part of the word) but depicted in a light, cartoonish way. A musical artist who particularly popularized the Pastel Gore aesthetic is Jack Stauber, and one of the earliest works that somewhat resembles this aesthetic is the web series Happy Tree Friends. As indicated by the name, the Pastel Gore aesthetic often times involves characters wearing vividly or saturated pastel colored outfits. Candy Gore, despite being an aesthetic very similiar to Pastel Gore, may use any colour palette and a broad range of colours. The main motifs used in Candy Gore include organs or blood replaced with candy (including melting candy), sugar or other sweet foods. Sometimes it also includes references to hearts or stars.

Pastels are also known as tints, and are pale tones of colors made by mixing a significant amount of white into the original shade. The pastel colors can be created by adding white, and the more white adding into the original shade, the paler the pastel will be.[1] They can tie into multiple aesthetics, like pastel fashion.

In particular, the NBC television police series Miami Vice popularized what was already a growing trend even further as its lead character Sonny Crockett (Don Johnson) exclusively wore pastel shirts and suits, setting a fashion that stood popular years after the show ended. The abundance of pastel was, and still is, also visible in the shooting locations with Art Deco buildings around the Miami area. Currently, pastels are often associated with kids and/or girls. They are can be seen on baby clothes, as well.",

The aesthetic is similar to Softie, but, unlike it, doesn't have a wide variety of possible colour palettes and focuses on peaches instead of gentleness. It falls into two categories: Modern Peach, which refers to the present by using more minimalist and simplified forms, often with a combination of pink and white, and Vintage Peach, which is associated with the past, pays great attention to nostalgia and appreciation of various art forms of the time, especially to the music and the fancy looks. Modern Peach\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther names\nPeachy, Peachcore\n\n\nKey colours\nWarm toned pink and orange, soft yellow, green, white\n\n\nRelated aesthetics\nKawaiiLo-Fi The Modern Peach aesthetic can be characterized by an emphasis on the beauty of modern life and the use of various peach-related sweets or any other goods to emphasize the cute and soul-warming things that can be noticed in one's daily routine. Modern Peach uses cities, social and artistic activities as a way of showing gratitude for the pleasant things that current events can offer. Going to the mall with friends, painting peaches, learning more fruit-based recipes, and doing one's best to help others are some of the possible activities that can be performed. Outfits this style consists of are usually quite simple and convenient, without too much lace or embroidery. Finding what to wear is surprisingly easy. Modern Peach aesthetics are all about the color and fruit, so you can wear a lot of peachy, warm-toned pink. The contemporary clothing options have a huge variety, so get creative!  Some examples of wearable items are: The make-up brand Too-Faced created a peach-themed product line, which might come in handy. Mostly related to current trends and popular artists, the music is characterized by positive lyrics and light motifs. Lo-Fi and K-pop are popular genres.

Unlike the other, more modern counterpart, Vintage Peach is characterized by a certain elegance in the composition and choice of clothing. Vintage Peach uses nature, social, and countryside activities as a way of reliving the best, happiest parts of the past. Picnics, book evenings in the orchards, long bike rides on a hot summer day, fruit picking with friends, going to a local market, and having a long bath with peach candles are all related. Tranquility in this instance can be shown through non-modernized activities. The outfits can be considered modest by today's standards, and are often inspired by the trends of the 1920-50s. Popular items include: The music has a very calming feel and is quite slow. The point is to make you feel relaxed and nostalgic.",

Sometimes farm animals may be included. This aesthetic can be focused on nostalgia, but not inherently. Imagery in petcore is usually more playful, and often similar to Kidcore. Darker styles may also be seen, often similar to the 2020 E-Kid aesthetic. More than actual animals, kemonomimi characters from anime(such as cat-girls and puppy-boys, for example) are associated with this aesthetic. The aesthetic(especially the more kawaii side of it) is often associated with both the sexual and non-sexual pet play communities, especially as a sister to the Babygirl aesthetic. Because of the nature of Petcore, it tends to overlap with various communities, such as the Furry community (especially when it comes to art) and Otherkin, therianthropy, animal-hearted, and other alterhuman subcultures, although most people in the Petcore community are not furries nor do they identify as animals. Although it is called petcore, exotic animals can fall under this aesthetic too, such as wolves, foxes, and big cats(which are not included in the neko aesthetic), for example. It is important to note that Petcore has nothing to do with bestiality(sexual acts on animals) and/or attraction towards animals. Animal abuse of any kind is not acceptable within this community. Petcore can sometimes include pictures of pets, but also anything related to pets. Petcore can be any color and it can depend on the represented pet, for example things with dogs are usually bright with the most common color being blue or other primary colors, but cats are usually associated with white or pink. Things which can be harmful to certain pets is sometimes included in petcore. This includes small fish bowls which don't include enough space for any fish or hamster wheels/balls which can be dangerous for hamsters. While petcore can be focused on nostalgia and the idealistic appeal of these things, it's still worth noting that these can be dangerous for the pets they apply to. The most notable aspect of petcore fashion are collars. Usually collars meant for big or medium dogs can be worn safely by human forms, and sometimes these include tags or keychains. They’re are also plenty of chokers(or even bondage collars) made for humans which resemble pet collars, and that are often more comfortable then dog collars. Aside from collars, other types of fashion might include: Because of the association with pet play, some aspects of petcore may be more activity focused. Examples of activity included in petcore includes: Ratcore is a creepy-cute subtype of Petcore that features images of rats. It can be similar to Cutegore. Puppycore is the Kawaii, Babycore like version of Petcore which is often associated with age regression. Although it is mainly associated with puppies, all baby animals/pets can be seen with this subtype. As well is babycore it is also heavily inspired by Jojifuku(particularly for girls). The Neko aesthetic, which overlaps with the Babygirl and Egirl/Kawaii Gamer aesthetics, is based off of Neko-girls(/people) from anime, aka characters that have the ears and sometimes tail of a cat and are often(but not always)sexualized, making this the most sexual of all the subtypes.",

There is also some overlap with work from online creators such as Alan Wagner (although not all of his work should be considered Phony Bureaucracy). The effectiveness of this technique may come from the familiar authority and coldness of authoritative media being juxtaposed with a sinister or threatening scenario.

As Telegram has become a source of rapid news on the topic of bombings, it has turned into a space of constant debate on the topic of truth of certain information. Over time, Ukrainian users developed slang and began trends connected to pork as a reclamation of slurs and stereotypes applied to their culture. Currently, pork-themed slang and imagery is used in a sarcastic manner on the Ukrainian side of Telegram. For example, the word нахрюк (roughly translating to oink) means \"fake news\" or \"fake information\". The Pig In Bubble Bath GIF is often sent as a response in conversations as a sign of negligence towards the opinions of one's opponents. Occasionally, imagery of the pig in a bubble bath is followed by these emojis: 🐷🐽🐖🫧💦💧🛁🧼.

The style is mainly expressed by women, although men are rarely involved. Female models are also called Cheesecake models, while men are called Beefcake models. Pin-up models would be photographed in anything from scantily clad clothing to being in the nude. In 1952 actress Marilyn Monroe was asked about her infamous 1949 pin-up photo (included in gallery) and said \"It’s not quite true I had nothing on: I had the radio on.\" Monroe, in more modern times, has become known as a sexual and feminist icon, and the pin-up modeling style was taken as a modern aesthetic which displays themes of sexuality, woman's empowerment, lust, and beauty. Adverts for burlesque shows in the 1800s were the beginning of pin-ups, even though the term wasn't developed until the 1940s. The Gibson Girl style of the late 1800s is also a part of the pin-up aesthetic's history but in a different aspect. Gibson Girls was a style based on Charles Dana Gibson’s art. It’s characterized by Edwardian corsets and Bouffant hair on women who were always keeping up with fashion trends. Unlike burlesque performers, Gibson Girls wouldn't show skin or perform for crowds. They wouldn't cover up in layers of shapeless gowns, preferring to wear close-fitting thin layered dresses to accentuate their curves. They were seen as the epitome of the modern woman: not afraid to go into the workforce, owning their sexuality, and displaying themselves confidently. This was controversial at the time and the public branded the behavior “slutty,\" a word which has no real meaning in and of itself but was historically disparaging. An often overlooked part of pin-up history is the Black history facet. Many famous cheesecake models were white, but bombshells like Dorothy Dandridge and Josephine Baker remastered their corners of the pin-up industry in the 1920s and 30s. Another artist that greatly contributed to pin-up’s devolvement was Alberto Vargas in the last 1930s. Similar to Gibson, his drawings were called Vargas Girls. They were much more provocative, often appearing completely nude. Although they were more sexual, they were more admired for their natural beauty than their sex appeal. When the United States entered World War Two in late 1941, pin-ups became popular to boost drafted troop morale. Models were seen as more sexual and kinky, often dressing up in military-inspired costumes, and were supposed to incite lust in young men. From here, pin-up modeling went down two routes; innocent, playful, yet suggestive; and naughty and bondagelike. The majority of pin-up modeling in the 1940s were the innocent/playful type (this is often called Gamine). Pin-up wasn't just photography, as many artists also painted pin-up models, like Earl Moran. Zoë Mozert was also a huge part of the early pin-up community. She was a painter who often used herself as a model, equipping cameras and mirrors. She signed an exclusive calendar contract with Brown and Bigelow the same year that the U.S. joined WWII, 1941. Most famous war-time pin-up models were women like Marilyn Monroe, Rita Hayworth, Betty Grable, Cleo Moore, Jayne Mansfield, etc. The magazine Playboy was a quintessential part of pin-up culture. It was founded by Hugh Hefner in 1953, and its first issue included the 1949 photo of Marilyn Monroe by Tom Kelley. The magazine caused the main uprise in kinky Bondage-style pin-ups rather than the pin-ups simply being shown to young soldiers. This era coincided with the rise of Bettie Page's fame. Page was one of Playboy's first playmates, which gave way to her fame. Hefner described Page as \"a combination of wholesome innocence and fetish-oriented poses that is at once retro and very modern.\". As her fame grew, so did her independence and public sexuality. In the 50s she started modeling and acting in fetish films and photos. She appeared in short \"specialty\" films where she acted out fetishes with only other women (important to note; this wasn't considered pornography necessarily, as no one in these films were ever naked). Because of her work in these films, she became known as the \"Queen of Bondage\" and \"The Girl with the Perfect Figure\". She often collaborated with model and photographer Bunny Yeager. Yeager was also a model, but never did pin-up or nudity, unlike Page. Page became the first famous bondage model. Her short films had themes of abduction, domination, spanking, leather costumes, slave-training, etc. Her acting range was anywhere from Dominatrix to helpless victim. Her work in the BDSM industry introduced conservative 1950s America to sexual exploration, which later inspired singers like Madonna, Britney Spears, and Lady Gaga. Pin-up modeling in the modern sense is a fashion style that involves clothes that are very skimpy and showing, and remains a modeling style to this day, with many celebrities posing nude at some point. The current aesthetic of pin-up is still lustful and is nostalgic to those who have seen retro trends, but has also inspired many other aesthetics that can be innocent and sweet but with a sexually aggressive edge. Pulp Magazines were cheap magazines from the late 1800s to the mid 1900 hundreds. They were also called \"pulp fiction\" \"the pulps\", \"slicks\", and \"glossies\". They were about 130 pages, and contained typical, mediocre fiction. Even though many renowned and respected authors worked on them, they were looked down on. Pulp magazines often featured pin-up art, called \"pulp art\". These stories had a variety of genres but almost always had some sort of sexual and exploitative aspect. Some of these genres were: The first pulp magazine was Argosy, from 1896, although it featured no art. In the beginning, they cost a nickel, which gave them the name \"dime novels\", although this price would later change. Street and Smith was the next big magazine in the pulp industry at the time, and did include art. Its fame skyrocketed when their book Ayesha was made into a series in 1905. It also made the Lost World sub-genre more popular, influencing other pulp writers like Robert E. Howard, Talbot Mundy, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and many others. It's popularity raised the price to ￠15. This encouraged Street and Smith to begin adding other genres to their magazine like detective, romance, spicy, mix of multiple types (like spicy detective), etc. By the 1930s, the most popular pulp magazines were Adventure, Argosy, Short Stories, and Blue Book. These inexpensive magazines became one the major sources of entertainment during the great depression. However, during WWII, paper became more expensive, since most resources were used for the war effort, and pulps became more costly. This made the original appeal of glossies disappear, which began its decline. To combat the paper shortages, many company's switched to digest sizes, which made them more compact and small. The popularity of comics, televisions, and paperbacks also negatively impacted their deterioration. By the 1950s, the \"Men's Adventure\" magazine's took pulps place. These magazines also featured pin-up art. Men's adventure magazines took pulp magazines place in the late 1940s up until the 1970s. They were also called \"armpit slicks\", \"the sweats\", or \"men's sweat magazines\". As the name suggest, these magazines were directed towards a male audience with stories of wartime adventures and enticing travels featuring pin-up girls. Pulp magazines like Argosy and Adventure eventually switched to sweat magazines. Other magazines popped up in the Men's Adventure genre like \"Swank\", \"World of Men\", \"Cavalier\", \"Man's Epic\", and \"Stag\". Because of World War Two, Nazi's and Communist's often took the villain role. They almost always featured the trope of damsels in distress. The introduction of sexually-deviant behavior was likely influenced by Bettie Page's S&M films and photography. Books featuring women in peril almost always shows women exploited and in bondage. Occasionally though, it showed women in power and dominance. These dominatrix characters would dominate men as well as women, or even both.",

The Pink Parisian aesthetic is focused especially on the architecture of the Belle Époque (a period usually dated to be between 1871–1880 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914), mainly Beaux Arts, Louis XVI Revival/Neo-Louis XVI and Rococo Revival/Neo-Rococo apartment buildings. Besides late 19th century and very early 20th century architecture, this aesthetic is also influenced by 17th and 18th century hôtel particuliers, built in the Baroque, Rococo and Louis XVI styles. Examples include Hôtel de La Guiche, Hôtel Biron, Hôtel de Soubise and Hôtel Matignon (all of these examples are in Paris). It's important to keep in mind that, despite how they are called, they were not hotels, but permanent residences for aristocrats. Similar residences were also built during the 19th century, like Hôtel d'Hautpoul or Hôtel du Rond-Point (both in Paris). Home decor is inspired by Parisian apartments, fashion designers ateliers, and hotel rooms in luxury hotels. As 1930s-1960s is the most popular time period associated with the style, music from these decades, especially in French, is popular. However, contemporary musicians that have a hyper-feminine persona and sing about unrequited love and luxury are also featured in some playlists.

It is a traditionally feminine aesthetic, heavily influenced by the Rococo era, the late Victorian era, and the Regency era, as well as modern or 20th century royalty. It emphasizes girlish innocence and has a nostalgic and often romanticized view of the past. Those who follow the Pink Princess aesthetic are inspired by real life princesses like Marie Antoinette as well as fictional princesses from fairytales and movies. Visually, pink princess is very similar to Romantic Academia, although it is not an academic aesthetic. Pink Parisian also has a significant influence on Pink Princess. Pink Princess highly influences the Dollette aesthetic as well. The color palette is heavy on pink tones combined with gold, white, or cream, with other pastel colors being slightly less common. Silver is sometimes used, but is much less common than gold. Pink Princess aesthetic embodies the philosophy of \"Take your pleasure seriously\" a phrase widely spread on tumblr after laduree-et-cigarettes answered an ask about it. Self love and treating oneself, especially in the form of luxuriating in the bathtub and sleeping, are a large part of this philosophy. Additionally, the Pink Princess aesthetic encourages kindness, generosity, and compassion, despite being a wealth related aesthetic. Many bloggers emphasize that their content is not meant for homophobes, transphobes, or racists. Clothing is ultra-feminine and made in soft fabrics like silk, satin, cotton, cashmere, and high quality wool. It is often embellished with ruffles, bows, and lace. The color black is usually limited to shoes, if worn at all. Although Rocco influence is part of the Pink Princess Aesthetic, in fashion, Marie-Antoinette style outfits are usually only used for costumes. Men take a backseat in the lives of the Pink Princess. Often the man behind the camera for bloggers, when a boyfriend does appear his clothing compliments hers but doesn’t overshadow it.

It \nusually involves boats, the sea, and treasure rather than actual crime.\nIt draws its inspiration from aesthetics such as Adventurecore and Crowcore, and may include things such as: collecting shells/rocks/trinkets/bones/etc, studying maps and constellations, sea travel, and sketching. Some may even take pride in their weaponry, mainly consisting of swords and daggers. People valuing Pirate aesthetics either have strong aspirations to travel the oceans, or ties to beachside mountains and/or homes. The aesthetic does get slight criticism due to the bad reputation of pirates in history. Though, the aesthetic itself does not value stealing and thieving, nor does it mean to present colonialism. The community around this aesthetic instead value freedom, fairness, curiosity and balance. Loyalty is a large factor in Pirate, and a moral code is usually presented. They are interested in the unknown and the mysteries of the ocean, and believe in hard work and a strength of heart and mind. Pirate design uses a lot of rustic, beachy, industrial and vintage elements. Examples include: Similar to Cottagecore, Dark Academia, and Adventurecore with some aspects of styles considered 'hippie' or 'boho'. Accessories can vary but are usually scarves, beads, chains and handmade jewellery, and unlike the neutral colors of the clothing, will range from bright colours to metallics.

The common graphical elements of these interfaces arose from the limitations of computer display capacities at the time, both in software and hardware. Many of the UI elements developed at the time such as the top menu, the task bar, and moveable palettes, have persisted to this day in many applications. Unlike Aero, the design language of the time never had a formal designation as it was literally developing with each implementations and technological innovations—no formal design took place in Windows until Windows 95. The name is thus taken from the fact that pixels were often the basic unit of these designs because individual pixels were still easily distinguished on display technologies of the time. MS-DOS and early first- and second-generation video games gave rise to the early 8-Bit aesthetic. In parallel, with the arrival of LisaOs in 1983, immediately followed by Classic Mac OS and Windows 1.0, a new UI language began to appear. That language became solidified with the consumer release of systems like Windows 3.0 in 1990, then Windows 95 in 1995. Pixel UI carried over certain elements of MS-Dos interfaces such as highlighting of selected menu options (whereas 8-Bit and Pixel Medieval Fantasy usually featured a blinking marker), but also introduced a variety of new conventions. The earlier versions of these systems were monochrome or extremely colour-restricted, with more developed colour spaces arriving later. Nonetheless their improved graphical capacities allowed a much broader use of outlines, where 8-Bit graphics often could not afford or had not figured out how to do so. With Windows 95 came a more subtle look that took advantage of this flexibility to introduce a bevelled or embossed look to some of the graphical elements. Due to comparable limitations, the aesthetics was also encountered in some video games of the era, although HUD-type interfaces tended to be more common. Low bandwidth and lack of subpixel rendering capabilities in many legacy systems also limited graphical options considerably in the contemporary Old Web. In the home computing sphere, Pixel UI design all but disappeared in 2001 with the arrival of Windows XP on PC and Mac OS X 10.0 on Mac, paving the way for the Frutiger Aero era. It maintained a presence in various elements of web design throughout the early and mid-2000s. (These games are mostly 8-Bit, but their UI borrows from Pixel UI)",

These projects often take the form of large, shared canvases where users contribute individual pixels to build a collective image. Some of the most popular examples of this aesthetic include r/place; a game that's hosted on Reddit for April Fools or PixelCanvas.io, although there's much more games like them out there. First and foremost, Pixelboard games are diverse. They often have large userbases who collaborate together to make pixel-based pieces of art, and what appears on a website largely depends on what the userbase likes or dislikes. While pixel art is the dominant topic, some common different tropes found inside this game genre includes internet culture (such as memes and most things that are popular in the internet) while other popular ones include topics related to countries, flags and national cultures or even world maps. Although it's meant to be a pretty wholesome aesthetic, with collaboration being its first priority, there's also certain Pixelboard games that could be offensive or include inappropiate content, since users can craft whatever they want, and consequently, destroy. However, this also largely depends on the moderation of the website/game and this aesthetic only focuses on the positive aspects. Although the exact origins of this aesthetic are hard to trace back, some specific websites like Reddit played an important role in its popularization. The subreddit \"r/place\" was first created as an experiment on Reddit in 2017 to celebrate April Fools Day[1] and gained popularity among the communities inside the website, with them coming together to make art that represents their subreddits. On the internet, there are many websites that look exactly like this (with some related keywords often used in the website names being \"pixel art\", \"pixel\", \"pxl\", \"canvas\", \"place\" or \"world map\"). Some of them may have been created as original ideas, while others could've been reactions to the huge success of r/place.

Pixiecore is similar to both, but unlike Fairycore, fashion usually involves more tunics and t-shirts and not as many pastels. Unlike Goblincore, it does not involve \"dirty\" things such as insects and dirt. Pixiecore is very loving of nature, but focuses more on indoor gardening such as succulents, cacti and terrariums. In British mythology, pixies (or piskeys) are small, mischievous, childlike, sometimes winged fae who are associated with willow the wisps, or swamp lights. In folklore, pixies love to play in water, and as such, pixiecore also focuses on things such as bathing in baths filled with things such as bubbles, soap petals and bath bombs. Similar to Crowcore and Goblincore, Pixiecore involves the culture of collecting things from the floor and keeping them. Pixiecore also focuses on rainbow tones, anything holographic, iridescent, or rainbow coloured can be involved in the aesthetic. The Pixiecore aesthetic can include: Pixiecore fashion is all about comfort. Typically, legs aren't exposed fully and are covered with either leggings, harem trousers, jeans or knee-length shorts. Tops include tunics and t-shirts, and sometimes knee-length or above dresses (though they always have leggings underneath). Shoes are generally flat and comfortable, such as Crocs, trainers, slip-on-shoes and Ugg-style boots. A lot of pixiecore fashion is thrifted as this is more sustainable. Patterns are a big part of Pixiecore, and most outfits consist with clashing patterns and lots of colour. This can include mixing and matching florals, pairing colourful shoes with tie-dye shirts or even wearing floral trousers with a floral shirt. Sometimes, this can create the appearance of pajama fashion. Pixiecore generally involves more magical and fantasy visuals than Fairycore. Similarities: Similarities:",

It could be viewed as a Brocore colored variant on the Boujee aesthetic with it's own unique tone and spin on things. Living life to the fullest in the most flashy ways possible, fast cars, tailored suits, traveling the world, the list goes on. At it's core the Playboy aesthetic is very hedonistic, though this too may vary. Visually, the Playboy aesthetic features luxury goods such as yachts, sports cars, mansions, private jets, beautiful women, and - in very rare instances where the Playboy aesthetic can get a little dark - copious amounts of drugs (see Drugcore), shared between himself, his friends, and his company for the evening.[1]  For a Playboy aesthetic with a slight retro flair, you might see the common Playboy tropes paired with Synthwave aesthetics and motifs (Miami Vice's Sonny Crockett being a prime example of this aesthetic in action). As far as locales go that can be associated with the Playboy aesthetic, while these can differ from one another, the Tropical aesthetic is a particularly popular setting for Playboy visuals, though that won't stop it from delving onto Swiss ski slopes for a more Wintery flavor of Playboy with a roaring fire in a private cabin with a beautiful woman by your side.  There is also a celebration of the night life, where a Playboy could be seen at a high-end club partying and having a good time with friends in the VIP Lounge (see Club). Fashion-wise, a lot of the Playboy aesthetic can be considered a masculine-coded variation of what would be popular in the Boujee or Corporate aesthetics, with nice suits, smoking jackets, and designer-brand clothing to show off their truly opulent and glorious lifestyles.  However, while suits in the Corporate setting are meant to show an air of professionalism, suits in the Playboy setting serve as more of a status symbol than anything, to show the world their perceived value as a top performer in their given industry and as something for young boys to aspire for when they grow up. Common elements of Playboy fashion include: Playboy refers to men. The closest female equivalents are socialites, or the Boujee aesthetic, but can be Femme Fatale if pushed to extremes. The Homme Fatale is the male variant of the Femme Fatale, it takes the old spy movie aesthetic to the extreme: guns, cocktails, women, hitmen, and criminality (similar to Spy Fiction and Cartelcore). This variation of the Playboy aesthetic includes more of an element of danger to it, as the Playboy lifestyle could be a means to an end (as seen in prime examples of the Homme Fatale aesthetic in action: the James Bond movies and Kingsmen) or as the ultimate perilous and eternal balance between business and pleasure. Femme Fatale often includes the theme of manipulating people for a woman to get her way - Homme Fatale more often has the male character be a \"player\" or popular with women. However, the Homme Fatale sub-aesthetic emphasizes action and danger with the same visuals as the Playboy aesthetic. The Wall Street subgenre take the hedonistic lifestyle and ramps it up to max, while also keeping a strong hustle-culture. As a subgenre it takes a much greedier and amoral approach to life and is heavily inspired by movies like 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street (starring Leonardo DiCaprio) and 1987's Wall Street (starring Michael Douglas).  The motto of a Wall Street Playboy is best summed up by the character Gordon Gekko from the aforementioned Wall Street: \"Greed is good.\" This subgenre is less active than the other subgenres. The Gentleman Playboy attends lavish Black Tie parties and sporting events. He is often surrounded by beautiful women. Boredom can lead to the Gentleman Playboy becoming a  Gentleman Thief (see Heistcore) or a detective. The Gentleman Playboy aesthetic is a more respectful variant of the Playboy aesthetic and movies relating to it treating women as equals/acquaintances (while this is also in other Playboy subgenres, it is more noticeable and emphasized in the Gentleman Playboy aesthetic). Men in this aesthetic subgenre are chivalrous and often kind - as the name of \"gentleman\" implies. The Dark Playboy aesthetic leans into the more sinister and narcissistic side of the aesthetic. Violence and wealth are key motifs. The character in a story that fits this subgenre may only care about wealth/power and does not care about how they get said wealth and power.  A popular example of this aesthetic in action is Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman from the 2000 film American Psycho, where they will often use the façade of the Playboy aesthetic to hide their psychopathic impulses. Characters that are in the Dark Playboy subgenre may start off as charming and fairytale-like, but reveal themselves to be dark, violent, and abusive later in the storyline. The Foreigner Playboy subgenre depicts a non-white wealthy man from a non-western country (typically India, Africa, or the Middle East). In fiction, the country may be entirely fictional (Black Panther is an example). If he’s not royalty, he might fall into the Arab Oil Sheikh trope.[2] This subgenre may be controversial due to its name, but is an important distinction in film, as non-western playboys are often portrayed very differently than western playboys.

Unlike the other subgenres of the latter, they mainly focus on the visuals rather than developing a distinctive musical style. As an umbrella term, Politicalwave emcompasses multiple aesthetics based around a broad set of political ideologies, and may sometimes clash with each other. Some infamous genres part of the umbrella include Laborwave, Fashwave, Militarywave, among many others. A criticism of Politicalwave aesthetics is that they can be considered a form of propaganda for controversial radical ideologies and authoritarian regimes, attempting to appeal to a younger audience familiar with Retro-themed aesthetics and electronic music genres. Similar phenomena includes Nazi Chic and Communist Chic. Both terms are used pejoratively to describe the incorporation of political symbology associated with radical movements (Nazism and Communism, respectively) into contemporary aesthetics, without fully understanding their meaning and historical significance. The term \"Politicalwave\" was first used by a small subreddit of the same name[1], and in fact, many of these styles were mainly popularized on Reddit, TikTok and YouTube. Although most of them were created during the late 2010s, The rise of these aesthetics is inherently related to the phenomenom of political polarization during the 2020s, and this includes online propaganda directed at teenagers on social media. The first political aesthetic trying to replicate Synthwave is thought to be Fashwave, which was first widely reported in 2016[2] as an alt-right attempt to infiltrate the Synthwave and Vaporwave communities, although it was met with strong disapproval. Then, after it became infamous, more people started to form communities based around the same concept but using their own personal agendas and ideas. Some of these genres have been covered as sources of indoctrination because they try to appeal to young, vulnerable audiences. Vaporwave itself has always had political elements, although the aesthetic itself isn't always a political statement. The visuals of Vaporwave can easily be interpreted as a way to satirize late-stage Capitalism, as well as consumerism in society. This political element of the aesthetic has therefore inspired subgenres like Laborwave, which exploit that aspect to promote a Communist agenda. Apart from that, other aesthetics like Fashwave were simply attacks on the Synthwave community; people of alt-right ideologies attempted to make the aesthetic become associated with Fascism or Nazism and hate speech, although they failed to do so because they confused Synthwave with Vaporwave and they were quickly pushed back by the true community. Other aesthetics simply surged on Reddit as a way to promote an agenda with the estabilished motifs of the former. Neo-Nazis trying to co-opt aesthetics with hate speech is nothing new: they also tried to do the same thing with Cottagecore and Punk, and even Nazi Chic, which was meant to be apart of the Punk movement and used in a satirical way but it was later reclaimed by Neo-Nazis. Anarchowave, as a portmanteau of \"anarcho-\" and \"-wave\", is an aesthetic used to promote Anarchism and pretty much all of its sub-ideologies. It combines some of the traditional elements of Synthwave with glitchy and distorted visuals and imagery relating to the Anarchist ideology, including historical figures, riots, uprisings, etc. It often criticizes modern society and Capitalism. Anarchowave edits usually feature imagery related to Anarchist organizations and pictures relating to insurrections and rebellions against authority, including but not limited to the CNT-FAI, the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, the Commune of Paris, etc. These images, unlike traditional Synthwave, are edited with heavy glitch effects and other elements to create a sense of chaos, as well as famous phrases that Anarchist politicians have said. Although rarely ever classified as a musical subgenre of Vaporwave, there's a few songs and tracks that could classify Anarchowave as a niche microgenre, such as M A K H N O W A V E  ブラックアーミー by Korach. Faragewave (sometimes also called Brexitwave) is an aesthetic that originated as a meme glorifying Nigel Farage, a British politician and leader of Reform UK, the right-wing populist political party of the United Kingdom responsible for \"Brexit\". The earliest examples of this meme date back to videos uploaded to YouTube in October 2016, although the aesthetic resurged in June 2024, especially in the context of political elections during the same year. This aesthetic often showcases conservativism, British or English nationalism, and \"optimism\" for the future. Born from being rejected by the larger mainstream Synthwave community, Fashwave was an attempt to take established Synthwave motifs and sounds and combine them with imagery often associated with the larger Neo-Nazism and White Supremacy movements. While it saw an uptick in activity in the late 2010s, it has seemingly seen its traction ground to a screeching halt after several musicians in the movement got banned from streaming platforms for everything ranging from the overt references to fascism and white supremacy to accusations of outright plagiarism of smaller artists within the Synthwave fanbase as a whole. A similar issue happened with the Cottagecore community, as alt-righters attempted to co-opt the aesthetic. Common Fashwave motifs will include hate symbols, such as the Schwarze Sonne, 14/88 (a reference to the Fourteen Words, a white supremacist slogan) and the 88 standing for HH (or Heil Hitler) and various fascist figures (with Hitler being the most popular one, followed by Donald Trump as he's adjacent). This also influenced the Hyperborean aesthetic, which uses similiar symbology. Fashwave can also confusingly implement Vaporwave motifs, which makes it come off as if the people in the community can't tell the difference between Synthwave and Vaporwave outside of both drawing heavy inspiration from the 80s and early 90s. Hyperborean (also known as \"Schizowave\" or \"Schizoposting\") is an aesthetic really similar to Fashwave, although with an identity distinct enough of its own. Named after the Ancient Greek legend of \"Hyperborea\", it uses visual elements relating to Esoteric Nazism (essentially the same thing as Neo-Nazism, but with mythological elements), beliefs in \"superior races\" or higher deities and Nordic aliens, internet memes like Trollge, conspiracy theories (especially from the pre-Soviet period), rampant anti-Semitism, and an anti-immigration bias. The symbology is overall identical to that of Fashwave, with the \"black sun\" being the most used symbol in Hyperborean edits, but it incorporates a sense of derealization and mythological motifs that sets it apart from the typical Vaporwave and Synthwave motifs. The use of dog whistles is also extremely common in this aesthetic, which internet accounts use to recognize each other. There have also been instances where they have appropiated Eurodance, Nightcore, Scenecore, or Hands Up songs by calling them \"Aryan Classics\", a practice that has been criticized by the fans of these music genres because they don't want to be associated with radical political movements. This specific subgenre has also been criticized for stigmatizing schizophrenia, since most people participating in it are not actually diagnosed with that condition and only use it as a disguise for their hateful beliefs. Militarywave is an aesthetic that consists of glorifying and promoting the Military, and sometimes also the Paramilitary, primarily seen in YouTube and TikTok. The edits mainly make use of military footage (including those from movies and first-person shooter video games) edited with VHS filters, glitch effects, and the addition of badass music, such as Drift Phonk, House Phonk and Russian Phonk (see Driftcore). Apart from its positive stance on the military, it doesn't have any particular political affiliation, although it usually aligns with authoritarianism and the right wing. As previously mentioned, it gained a wide following in TikTok, often influenced by aesthetics such as Driftcore, Sigma and Larpercore. The Militarywave community was criticized for defending the military so much to the point of acting homophobic. For example, they made many \"Military vs the LGBT+ community\"-themed videos, and they came accross as offensive or incorrect to many because the two are not mutually exclusive. The general idea is problematic because it overlooks the existence of gay or transgender soldiers. Most of the teenagers involved with this aesthetic can't fathom the fact that the LGBT+ community also has a history of fighting for greater human rights, with some arguing that the military fought for their flags but not the LGBT+ community. The Militarywave community also tends to exclude female and non-white soldiers from their edits. Similar to the PSY-OP Girl aesthetic, it was also criticized for pushing a pro-military agenda into a young and vulnerable teenage audience. Mainly overlapping with the followers of Andrew Tate and the Polandball or Countryballs fandom, as well as the Anti-Furry and TikTok Mapping communities, the aesthetic also faces criticism because they portray historical events in a propagandistic and unauthentic way. Those who partake in Militarywave aesthetic often don't actually learn history and they just glorify it because they think it's \"cool\" or \"edgy\". A crucial part of learning history is not repeating the mistakes that our ancestors commited in the past, but instead, they ignore that aspect and glorify events such as World War II or simply have distorted views of what happened during these times. They also tend to overlook the trauma that many soldiers who participated in war went through, and this is reflected in how they stereotype veterans as \"strong\" or \"real\" men. On June 29, 2024, Rishi Sunak, the former prime minister of the United Kingdom from 2022 to 2024, posted an edit glorifying the British military on Twitter/X[3], some days before his position as the prime minister was succeded by Keir Starmer. The video featured the song \"Little Dark Age\" by MGMT, which was largely appropiated by content creators focusing on the Militarywave aesthetic. This demonstrates how politicians and public figures might try to take advantage of these aesthetics to promote their ideals to the youth, although his tweet was largely made fun of because internet users recognized his intentions. Monarchowave, as a portmanteau of \"Monarcho-\" and \"-wave\", is an aesthetic that originated in early 2020 on the subreddit r/monarchism, and like the name implies, it uses the visuals of Synthwave and Vaporwave to promote Monarchism and the royalty. It is quite similiar to Tradwave because it also implements traditional elements and anti-modernism, although it's not as heavy about religion as Tradwave. It started out as a niche edit genre, although it later gained some traction on Reddit. Sometimes overlapping with Royalcore, Monarchowave edits often portray images of European kings and queens, as well as Russian tsars or German kaisers. VHS filters, censored eyes, bright colour filters and flags historically related to Monarchism are quite common in the visuals. NATOwave is an aesthetic focusing on the interventionist political ideology and the promotion of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). Various interventionist tendencies depict conflicting ideologies within the movement with some praising NATO only as a collective defence force, while others embrace a more Neo-Conservative or Hawkish agenda, focusing on anti-communism, cold war conflicts and political figures such as George Walker Bush, the 43rd president of the United States of America. Despite being inspired by Fashwave and Laborwave, which correspond to the extremes of the political spectrum, NATOwave rather aligns with the political center and incorporates ideas that these movements tend to oppose such as modernity, liberal thought and globalism, while rejecting radical and populist political ideology almost entirely. NATOwave is often thought of specifically as a contrarian response to these movements, or reclaiming the Synthwave and Vaporwave aesthetics from online extremists. The first known mention of NATOwave was on a video uploaded by the YouTube user Schizo Pilled on February 19th, 2021. Titled N A T O W A V E, the video features war footage, particularly footage of fighter jets and tanks, edited with a VHS-like Synthwave filter along with the song Little Dark Age by MGMT playing on the background (in fact, that song came to be associated with politically motivated edits and aesthetics at some point[4]). Two months later on April 19th, the r/NATOwave subreddit was created, for the purpose of sharing pro-NATO edits, memes and Vaporwave mixes. NATOwave started to see an uptick in popularity in 2022 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the creation of Pro-Ukrainian and Pro-Taiwanese content soon followed. Laborwave is an aesthetic that emerged within certain far-left circles that is less subtle about its critiques of Capitalism and takes advantage of this aspect of Vaporwave to promote a Communist or Socialist agenda, being supportive of extremist ideologies such as Marxism-Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism, Juche and in rare cases, National Bolshevism or Anarcho-Communism. The Laborwave scene is characterized by its focus on themes such as class struggle, anti-capitalism, Marxism and far-left revolutions, being common among its edits political symbols like the Red Star or the Hammer and Sickle. While other Politicalwave aesthetics often incorporate Synthwave, Laborwave is almost always based on Vaporwave. Laborwave music mostly consists of slowed-down versions of popular songs from communist states/organizations such as the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, North Korea, the Naxalites, the Shining Path, and the Khmer Rouge, somehow managing to make the instruments sound like popular Vaporwave staples, although without being otherwise transformative with it. Much as Fashwave, its visual component of consists of Retro-Futuristic imagery, including neon colors or palm trees, with references to communist symbology such the Hammer and Sickle, or imagery associated with communist or far-left political figures like Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro or Kim Il-Sung. Socialist figures such as Hugo Chávez, Bashar al-Assad or Muammar Gaddafi have been also depicted among its edits. Laborwave is sometimes confused with Sovietwave due to their focus on aesthetics related to Communism and anti-capitalism, although they're pretty different visually and musically. Laborwave often uses quite ironic and absurdist visuals in its portrayal of Soviet Nostalgia, while Sovietwave is almost entirely limited to the former USSR and is a more sincere form of nostalgia for the long gone Red Regime. Sovietwave tends to replicate Soviet utopian art earnestly, longing for the future that was promised, and is more fond of expressing awe at the might of the Soviet Union, while Laborwave tends to make fun of such propaganda and grandiose expressions even if Laborwave adherents are serious about being pro-communist. Additionally, Sovietwave music counts as a niche subgenre of Synthwave, while Laborwave simply takes clues from Vaporwave. As a portmanteau of \"liberty\" and \"-wave\", Libertywave is an almost entirely visual-based subgenre that has a heavy focus on right-leaning and liberty-promoting ideologies, which much like Fashwave, often confuses the Synthwave and Vaporwave aesthetics. It is closely related to Anarchowave, another political subgenre that also focuses on anti-authority but with an obvious approach/perception and tactics typically associated with left-wing groups. Although predominantly associated with the political situation of the United States, it is also shared by other nations worldwide who are in the same circumstances about their own countries or governments, etc. It is a niche subgenre, and some motifs associated with the aesthetic include depictions of Libertarianism, the American Revolution and anti-authoritarian and anti-socialist imagery, which might sometimes cross the line into hate speech towards other people with different political affiliations. Serbwave (sometimes also called Yugowave) is a political aesthetic that surged as a meme in online communities such as YouTube and Discord, and as its name implies, it's based around Serbian nationalism, the paramilitary of Republika Srpska and Yugoslavian nostalgia. Users who partake in this aesthetic usually take videos related to the Yugoslav Wars and Turbofolk war songs from Republika Srpska (an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina) and remix them to resemble Vaporwave or Synthwave. This subaesthetic is often akin to Fashwave and Laborwave, but it's important to note that most people who participate on Serbwave are not actually Serbian, many of them just find the war-related topics \"edgy\" or \"cool\". Similar to Balkan Violence Tumblr, it takes imagery from the Yugoslav Wars, one of the bloodiest conflicts in modern European history, hence why this aesthetic has been deemed insensitive by some citizens of the countries involved. A YouTube user notable for uploading multiple music videos and edits related to Serbwave is TheAthelasProject, who is actually from Montenegro and not Serbia or Republika Srpska. Tradwave is an aesthetic used to promote traditionalism and Catholicism. Tradwave usually uses traditional Catholic paintings, sculptures, or photographs of saints, given with Vaporwave effects, often with a bible verse or quote about Catholicism. The art usually tries to convey a resurrection of Catholic spirituality in the modern atheist-leaning world. Figures often depicted in Tradwave edits or art include Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, Ven. Fulton Sheen, Cardinal Robert Sarah, and Mother Angelica. Tradwave music often takes the form of two main styles. One of them is catholic hymns with Vaporwave effects and traditional Vaporwave or Lo-Fi music. It can also have quotes from modern prolific Catholic figures, such as Ven. The other theme is Fulton Sheen and Cardinal Robert Sarah.

The Pont-Aven School was formed by a group of artists including Émile Bernard, Charles Laval, Paul Sérusier and multiple other artists from both western Europe and north America, but the most highlighted artist of this movement is Paul Gauguin[1], considered leader of the movement. It was active in the town from the late 19th century to the early 20th century. The Pont-Aven School's style was characterized by its bold colour palette, simplified forms, and flat decorative surfaces, as well as traditional elements from the town of Pont-Aven, like beautiful landscapes and elements of Breton culture. It played an important role on the development of the larger Synthetism art movement. The region of Brittany, today located in northwestern France, has inspirated many artists for centuries, principally due to its picturesque towns and cities, as well as its natural beauty. The Pont-Aven School began to emerge in the mid-1880s, when Paul Gauguin first visited the commune of Pont-Aven. Pont-Aven is a relatively small village in the south of Brittany, in the Finistere department. Paul Gauguin particularly chose this village as his main source of inspiration because tourism had increased in the rest of the Brittany region. He was looking for a special place that was not polluted with tourists and commercial activity. That's why he felt drawn to the town's scenery and its traditional culture. Gauguin soon became a leader among the artist colony that was founded in Pont-Aven, and he encouraged them to experiment with new styles and techniques. The city of Pont-Aven then became an important hotspot of international artists. In modern times, Pont-Aven is still a small town, with less than 3k residents, so this movement left a truly important legacy there. The town still attracts artists and art lovers, and the Musée des Beaux Arts de Pont-Aven houses a permanent collection dedicated to the Pont-Aven School. This is also reflected in popular culture: Pont-Aven is often nicknamed the \"la cité des peintres\"[2], which translates to \"the city of the painters\". The artists of the Pont-Aven School united under various art disciplines and values. One of the main ones was its rejection towards Naturalism in art. They believed that their artworks must not try to replicate the beauty of the natural world and instead they preferred to simplify natural elements like fields, grass, trees, forests, plants, etc. The Pont-Aven School is best known for its development of Synthetism, which shares the same principle of anti-naturalism. The first international artists to arrive in Pont-Aven were a group of American art students from Philadelphia, including Henry Bacon, Robert Wylie, C. J. Way, Earl Shinn, and Howard Roberts[3]. They were followed by other French and American artists, including Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Charles Laval, and Émile Schuffenecker. Paul Gauguin in particular had an important influence on the movement and many of those other artists were inspired by his works. He became the leader of the art movement in the late 1880s, and he encouraged the other artists to find uniqueness and experiment with new styles and tecniques, which eventually led to the creation of Synthetism. Synthetism was based on the idea that art should be influenced by multiple subjects. In this case, Synthetism was inspired by Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and traditional Japanese art. In 1889, Paul Gauguin organized an important exhibition of Impressionist and Synthetist art in Paris. The exhibition was unsuccessful and was deemed an economical disaster, but it helped to introduce the Pont-Aven School to a wider audience. In fact, some people argue Paul Gauguin's artworks were not well appreciated by mainstream society until various years after he passed away[4]. Eventually, the The Pont-Aven School began to decline in the early 1890s. Paul Gauguin, who was the leader of the movement, decided to leave Brittany to visit Tahiti, where he hoped to become richer, and he ultimately moved there on the 1st of April of 1891. That marked the downfall of the Pont-Aven School, and many of its members abandoned their hopes to continue with the art movement.

Often, these images are simply photographs of real pools, or pool water, but they are also frequently 3d renders or art. Poolcore was born from the internet and similar aesthetics, such as liminal spaces, so the images are often familiar, or seem as if you've seen them before. Poolcore can have several different vibes, with some pools giving off more of a Cleancore vibe, whilst others will be more nostalgic or liminal in appearance. Despite having the ability to be inspired by other aesthetics or appear similar, Poolcore has many defining features including tiles, water, a blue color pallet and the patterns the water in the pool lets off. Poolcore can suggest feelings of eeriness and serenity or peacefulness. The way that Poolcore makes you feel is a slight mix of two very separate things, seeing as the feelings of liminality insinuate creepy or eerie feelings of being to place before, or seeing the pools in a dream. Dreams are often a thing which incorporate water, so as such, a lot of people will find that they've seen similar (or exact) places like the pools in their own dreams. The peaceful feeling is driven by the clean tiles or the blue and white colors which are a part of the images along with the clear water which can strike one as being serene, hence the feelings of serenity. The nostalgic feeling often associated with Poolcore is one based in logic, as many people went to pools as children, or have been to many in their life. Pools often look fairly similar, so the liminality and nostalgia make sense as the pools one has been to all feel like they cross over as a whole in Poolcore images. Poolcore visuals are generally very blue in appearance, although not always the case, and often have tiles which are commonly white and square-shaped. Other times the tiles in Poolcore are darker shade, such as navy or lighter blue colors. In 3d renders, the tiles are most often up the sides of the walls as well as under the water, but since actual pools don't generally look like that, real pool photographs will almost never have their tiles all the way around, and just have them inside of the pool. The pool water or light going through the water is a big part of Poolcore, and the way that the light hits the water is often a prominent visual feature. Along with this, the pattern of the water is sometimes the main feature of an image, and some Poolcore photos will just show the water's light reflections on the bottom of the pool, or the top of the water. Since these types of Poolcore images will mostly be close-ups, the tiles are often a large part of the whole image. Some Poolcore images tie in very closely with Nostalgiacore or Kidcore, and as such will have more colorful aspects along with the other basic elements of Poolcore. These pools originally aimed more at children will often have water slides, or water playgrounds in the pool, and will often give off a different type of nostalgia than the less colorful pools. Poolcore images can have other main colors, although blue is always the most prominent amongst all images based in Poolcore. Some Poolcore images will have a vaporwave-like color pallet with peachy-pinks or purples amongst the regular blue, although often such images would fall entirely under the vaporwave aesthetic, seeing as pools can be a big aspect of some vaporwave. Jared Pike is an artist who creates 3d renders of aesthetic pools which include white tiles, and water in pool rooms.",

The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane cultural objects. Pop art is known for portraying simple household items and cultural idols in bright and eye catching colors. Common aspects of pop art include: saturated colors, bold outlines, boldness and dotted painting. Pop art is meant to be fun, lighthearted and even childlike. It is a reactionary movement to the more serious Abstract Expressionist art of the time period. Pop art is meant to challenge the idea of what art should be. Young artists felt like the things they were being taught and the tings they saw in art museums had nothing to do with their everyday lives -  so pop art reflects the lives of these artist by featuring basic items, such as Campbell's Soup Cans. Pop art had the ability to connect fine art to the masses. Today, Pop-art gives commentary on current world events and consumerist culture. Hence, he name \"Pop\" art - Popular art. Pop Art seemed to fizzle out around the early 1970s, and some believe Pop Art \"died\" when Andy Warhol was shot. Some key figures in pop art were Richard Hamilton, Andy Warhol and Roy Liechtenstein. Women are often excluded from the narrative of pop art, however they did play a big part in it's development. Notable female pop artists include: Rosalyn Drexler, Marisol and Evelyne Axell. Pop art visuals are bright and colorful, putting emphasis upon the theme of pop art being fun in order to oppose Abstract Expressionist Art. Pop art utilized images and icons from popular media and products. This included commercial items like soup cans, road signs, photos of celebrities, newspapers, and other items popular in the commercial world. Even brand names and logos were incorporated. Pop art is characterized by vibrant, bright colors. Primary colors red, yellow, and blue were prominent pigments that appeared in many famous works, particularly in Roy Lichtenstein’s body of work. Humor was one of the main components of Pop art. Artists use the subject matter to make a statement about current events, poke fun at fads, and challenge the status quo. Pop art did not start as a fashion movement, however that does not mean that pop art themed fashion does not exist. A notable piece of pop art fashion is The Souper Dress, by Campbell Soup, inspired by Andy Warhol's art. A pop art themed outfit would aim o include key motifs of pop art: saturated colors, imagery of every day objects or celebrities, bold lines and even polka dot patterns. Pop art themed clothes are still produced today, and can often be found on sites such as Etsy and Redbubble.",

The apocalytic event may be climatic, such as runaway climate change; natural, such as an impact event; man-made, such as nuclear holocausts; medical, such as a plague or virus, whether natural or man-made; or imaginary, such as a zombie apocalypse or an alien invasion. The story may involve attempts to prevent an apocalypse event, deal with the impact and consequences of the event itself, or may be Post-Apocalyptic, and be set after the event. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, the way to maintain the human race alive and together as one, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in a non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of society and technology remain[1]. Other themes may be cybernetic revolt, divine judgment, dysgenics, ecological collapse, pandemic, resource depletion, supernatural phenomena, technological singularity, or some other general disaster. Visuals in Post-Apocalyptic worlds can vary based on the timeline and cause of the disaster. Typically, most visuals may include: Fashion in Post-Apocalyptic scenarios are based on what is needed for survival and what one can carry without too much effort. On the other hand, the aesthetic community focuses on how proper clothing can be styled. Fabrics can be light and breathable or heavy and warm depending on the season and the ability to have free movement is key. The most important element of Post-Apocalyptic fashion is protection from elements, especially if battle or inclimate weather is abundant. Key items include: Fashion items include: Although Post-Apocalyptic is a fiction based aesthetic, it is seen in the real world through some festivals that are similar to Renaissance Faires.

Some examples of Post-Ironic memes include: Amogus, Gigachad or Trollge. At its core, they're memes in which you can't tell whether the poster really agrees with what they're saying or not. The aesthetic's main motifs include scribbled black and white drawings, bait-and-switch formats, excessive references to certain pieces of media, offensive memes or nostalgic memes attempting to recreate the Rage Meme Era. The Post-Irony Meme Era may be slowly coming to an end, especially due to the rise of short video content, which made memes quickly diversify and make the audience's sensibilities change in little to no time. Being one of the shortest meme eras, it was preceded by the \"Surreal Era\" (which includes of Deep Fried Memes and Surreal Memes) and succeded by the ironic Gen Alpha Brainrot memes, although some may debate they are both the most popular meme genres at the moment.

This led to an explosion of memes  on TikTok using the African-American Vernacular[2] term (often labeled as \"Gen Z slang\"), memes involving games like Subway Surfers or Talking Ben, YouTubers such as iShowSpeed, early 2010s default ringtones labelled as \"Goofy Ahh sounds\", and icons such as Quandale Dingle and \"Goofy Ahh Productions\".

It is often described as a more feminine and nerdier version of Olderbrothercore. Its main motifs are anime-inspired art styles and pop culture from that time period. The aesthetic gets its name from an observation made by NekoRikiRawrr, who coined the aesthetic name based on the large Lord of the Rings poster she had observed in a few of the aesthetic’s pioneers’ bedroom photos. The Poster Gal art style can best be described as a heavily stylized and exaggerated Chibi art style with western animation influence. The art style usually with features that show the art’s age and are more difficult to replicate perfectly these days, such as low quality airbrush shading or visible pixels The Poster Gal aesthetic has been around since before the age of deviantART, however really began taking off once the 2000s rolled around. With the advent of the site deviantART in August 2000, posting art on the web was now far easier, so as artistic teenagers with internet access do, they flocked to the website in droves and began to post images. Most were geeks and otaku, drawing in a modified anime art style described best as “What if Tiny Toon Adventures was an anime?” 2002 and 2003 were the years that many artists now associated with Poster Gal joined deviantART, with Brianna Garcia, whom is the most notable Poster Gal artist joining in 2003 and instantly gaining traction. Due to the success of Brianna Garcia’s works,  many copycats soon followed, evolving the Poster Gal art style. “Bri-Chan was the new thing, everyone was hopping in to also make it big like she did.” NekoRikiRawrr says. Bri-Chan’s success is a contributing factor as to why much media associated with Poster Gal is even associated with it at all, along with the general interests of these geeky teenage girls. This is not to say Poster Gal was entirely based on Bri-Chan’s works, as it existed before she did, and some Poster Gal artists did not seem to have any influence from Bri-Chan’s work As the year 2006 hit, Bri-Chan began to drift away from Poster Gal art (although she had been drifting from it since 2004) but some of the artists that were still around from Bri-Chan’s popularity boom continued to use a Poster Gal art style if their art had not already evolved past her style. An offshoot of Poster Gal known as Kawaii Warrior started to appear in 2009, and it attempted to keep the legacy of the aesthetic strong, combining a less refined Poster Gal art style with bright, colorful characters often described as “Sparkle-dogs”, even outlasting the Poster Gal aesthetic itself By the mid-2010s the anime craze of deviantART had begun to recede and most of the artists associated with the aesthetic had left the website or had a more evolved art style. Kawaii Warrior was still going strong, but was more prominent on websites such as YouTube, in which animation memes as we know them were arguably born. In mid 2024, Brianna Garcia deleted her deviantART account, although she had been taking down photos en masse for long before that, many of these photos being her Poster Gal works Poster Gal music is mostly just what was popular around the era in the alternative and rock scenes, along with music many deviantART users of the period listed in the 'Favorite Musician' tab of their profile.

They focused their attention upon creating clear, sharp and realistic depictions of religious and mythological scenes, particularly those highlighting beautiful and famous women. Their style was grandiose, imaginative yet sincere. The Pre-Raphaelites aimed to revive the style of Italian painters in the Quattrocento period (early Renaissance), as opposed to the then influential Mannerist style (which had been popular in the later Renaissance). The Pre-Raphaelites believed that this style (influenced heavily by Raphael (a High Renaissance master)), corrupted the academic teaching of art, and so the name Pre-Raphaelite was conceived. Despite the Brotherhood parting ways in the early 1850s, the style remained popular and influential well into the later 19th century, and is still a point of aesthetic interest today. Some even claim that the Pre-Raphaelites were the founders of Modern Art. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded in 1848. William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner made up the seven man brotherhood. The Brotherhood's main endeavour was painting, but poetry and the critiquing of art was also a pursuit of its members. The Brotherhood started to display their work in 1849, signing their artworks 'PRB'. They also published a literary magazine titled 'The Germ', which was published with the intent of further distributing their ideas. In 1850, the Brotherhood experienced a wave of critical backlash after a painting by John Everett Millais, 'Christ in the House of His Parents' was deemed as ugly and downright blasphemous by numerous reviewers. Famous author Charles Dickens infamously critiqued that the painting made the family of Jesus Christ appear to be alcoholics, and that their poses were absurd. Such criticism sent the Brotherhood on a downwards spiral in which they never quite recovered from, with the Brotherhood essentially dissolving in 1853. However, the term 'Pre-Raphaelite' stuck to the Brotherhood's members and became adopted by their future associates, as well as artists inspired by their style, thus the term 'Pre-Raphaelite' can be applied more liberally than to just art produced by the Brotherhood. The earliest iterations of Pre-Raphaelite style are a far cry from the dreamy and ethereal image that the Pre-Raphaelites are known for today. Early Pre-Raphaelite style was heavily influenced by artists such as Botticelli (in fact, the Brotherhood wholly revived his popularity after he faded into relative obscurity after his death in 1510). There was a particularly strong Gothic influence on the Brotherhood's work. After the Brotherhood split, the individual painters mostly deviated from their past goals of directly imitating Medieval art. Instead they focused their efforts into embodying nature and realism. Dante Gabriel Rossetti can largely be credited with evolving the style to feature its - now iconic - depictions of dreamy femme fatales. The later Pre-Raphaelite style was characterized by striking lighting and it's detailed depictions of nature. Strong, vivid colors were also crucial.",

It flourished from the decade of the 1920s to the early 1930s. Although especially influenced by European art movements such as Purism, Orphic Cubism and Italian Futurism (particularly Aeropittura), it had its own characteristics exclusive to the situation of the United States, such as fascination with industrialism in the landscape of the American countryside. It was meant to be an art movement with an uniquely American cultural identity[1], and some artists working on this aesthetic were discontent to acknowledge its European influence. Those who participated in this art movement are collectively called the Precisionists, and earlier they were more known as Immaculates, although they were never an united or formal distinctive group of artists. Instead, they were classified with each other through common styles and art techniques[2]. Although a few Precisionists were friends with each other, most of them were unrelated and they never published a collective manifesto to declare the ideas or philosophy of the movement. However, the general ideology aligns with Modernism. It's hard to tell who really coined the term \"Precisionism\". The most widely accepted interpretation states that it was coined in 1927 by Alfred H. Barr, the former director of the Museum of Modern Art, in Manhattan, New York City. According to the art historian Amy Dempsey, it was actually first coined by Charles Sheeler, a painter notable for his Precisionist artworks. For the most part, Precisionist art doesn't really have a shared history, because the painters never had an unified formal program[3]. Therefore, it's safe to say that Precisionism was simply coined by art critics for the purpose of classifying artworks in museums and art galleries by style. The earliest examples of what was later labelled Precisionism can be traced back to the late 1910s. Although most Precisionist artists didn't personally know each other, some of them who did exhibited their works together during the 1920s, especially in the Daniel Gallery of New York City. Precisionism had an indirect impact on its successor Pop Art, especially with Demuth's painting titled I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold (1928). The visuals of Precisionism primarily focused on industrialization and the urban landscapes of the United States. The Preciosionists liked to experiment with elements such as skyscrapers, skylines, industrial bridges and factories to convey modernity in their artworks. They also used flat planes and geometric compositions, and started incorporating ideas and art techniques that would be popular later on in aesthetics that emerged after World War II, such as reducing details to a graphic form and simplifying art to show the world in a reduced and minimal form[4], somewhat being a precursor to Minimalism. The art tends to depict the places portrayed as desolated, with no kind of human figures anywhere to be seen. Some works may also resemble Liminal Spaces.",

Preppy came from the way Ivy school upper class kids would dress and carries a lot of the same motifs. However, Pretty Preppy branches out in the 80's with a girly vibe added to the, before serious, way of dressing.

When it comes to this aesthetic the clothes are meant to symbolize wealth, femininity and power. The purpose here is to make everyone think \"Wow, that girl could ruin lives while wearing heels higher than my pay grade!\". It typically consists of plaid skirts, matching blazers, white shirts under sweaters or dresses with the collar sticking out and knee socks. Mary Jane and Oxford shoes are also seen a lot, and while hairstyles are varied, accessories are everywhere and headbands are a must.

It is about the visual: looking like a princess, but also the behavior: being poised, educated and well-mannered, but most importantly, having all the qualities to take reign. The main subtype of Princesscore is Pink Princess. The atmosphere is strongly linked to the position of a princess, because it reflects the cultural traditions and various aspects of her life. Besides, this asks or answers various questions about her status and unknown future.

It is important to note that Progressive Academia should not considered a pure subset of the larger Academia family, but more a deconstructed version of it, influenced by the Commonwealth movements for progressive university education and mid to late-1900s architectures. An example of a new progressive-styled university college is New College (Toronto). Progressive Academia started with the foundation of New College at the University of Toronto in 1962. As such, it is a movement with its roots in Canada and the larger Commonwealth's evolving academic traditions, especially in the values of diversity and anti-conformity. Progressive Academia is a manifestation of the progressive movement in universities and in education-at-large, but it is important to note that Progressive Academia is still based around the tenets of Classic Academia, while actively rejecting all \"restrictive\" views of this particular family of aesthetics, making it a syncretic position between more \"traditional\" and \"progressive\" aesthetics. Popular architectural styles are brutalist, or curvilinear architectures similar to the work of Douglas Cardinal. Spaces that are designed in a progressive academic manner usually conform to certain basic standards: If one wishes to dress in a progressive academic manner, it would be prudent to follow design rules 1, 3, and 4 (seen in the Visual section) when choosing an outfit.",

Psychedelic art and music typically recreate or reflect the experience of altered consciousness. Psychedelic art uses highly distorted, surreal visuals, bright colors and full spectrums and animation (including cartoons) to evoke, convey, or enhance the psychedelic experience. Psychedelic music uses distorted electric guitar, Indian music elements such as the sitar, electronic effects, sound effects and reverberation, and elaborate studio effects, such as playing tapes backwards or panning the music from one side to another. Advances in printing and photographic technology in the 1960s saw the traditional lithography printing techniques rapidly superseded by the offset printing system. This and other technical and industrial innovations gave young artists access to exciting new graphic techniques and media, including photographic and mixed media collage, metallic foils, and vivid new fluorescent \"DayGlo\" inks. This enabled them to explore innovative new illustrative styles including highly distorted visuals, cartoons, and lurid colors and full spectrums to evoke a sense of altered consciousness; many works also featured idiosyncratic and complex new fonts and lettering styles (most notably in the work of San Francisco-based poster artist Rick Griffin). Many artists in the late 1960s and early 1970s attempted to illustrate the psychedelic experience in paintings, drawings, illustrations, and other forms of graphic design. In the modern era, computer graphics may be used to produce psychedelic effects for artwork. For more information, see: Psychedelic music (Wikipedia) Psychedelic Rock is a rock music genre that is inspired, influenced, or representative of psychedelic culture, which is centered on perception-altering hallucinogenic drugs. The music incorporated new electronic sound effects and recording techniques, extended instrumental solos, and improvisation. Many psychedelic groups differ in style, and the label is often used spuriously. Psychedelic rock began to come into the popular consciousness in 1965-1967 with impactive albums such as Pet Sounds (1966) by the Beach Boys or The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators (1966). Psychedelic rock and the hippie movement as a whole reached new heights with the release of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). The album was released at the beginning of the Summer of Love, a social phenomenon that occurred during the summer of 1967, when as many as 100,000 people, mostly young people sporting hippie fashions of dress and behavior, converged in San Francisco's neighborhood of Haight-Ashbury. Psychedelic rock continued to experience popularity until its decline began from 1969-1971. The Woodstock Festival of 1969 was considered the cultural peak of the hippie movement and Psychedelica as a whole, featuring many signature psychedelic acts such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience or Jefferson Airplane. Notable artists include: Emerging from the mid-1960s garage punk movement, Acid rock stands as a genre of rock music with fluid boundaries. This musical form played a pivotal role in propelling the psychedelic subculture into existence. Taking its name from lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), this style is characterized by its utilization of intense, distorted guitars, lyrical themes revolving around drugs, and extended, impromptu musical sessions. It shares considerable common ground with 1960s garage punk, proto-metal, and the early blues-infused hard rock. While occasionally used interchangeably with \"psychedelic rock,\" acid rock specifically denotes a subgenre closely related to, yet distinct from, the broader psychedelic rock style. In contrast to its psychedelic rock counterpart, acid rock adopts a harsher, more resonant, and weightier auditory profile. Its origins are primarily rooted in the American West Coast, where bands diverged from the whimsical and novelty-focused elements of British psychedelia. Instead, this subgenre accentuated the more potent aspects associated with both the positive and adverse dimensions of the psychedelic encounter. Neo-psychedelia is a diverse genre of psychedelic music that draws inspiration from the sounds of 1960s psychedelia, either updating or copying the approaches from that era. Originating in the 1970s, it has occasionally seen mainstream pop success but is typically explored within alternative rock scenes. It initially developed as an outgrowth of the British post-punk scene, where it was also known as acid punk. After post-punk, neo-psychedelia flourished into a more widespread and international movement of artists who applied the spirit of psychedelic rock to new sounds and techniques.",

Psychonautics is defined as the methodology for discovering altered or non-ordinary states of consciousness, typically produced by meditation, hallucinogenic and/or psychedelic substances, as well as phenomenological-based research which attempts to navigate these altered states of consciousness to gain a deeper insight into the nature, structure, and mystery of the human psyche and the unconscious mind. The terms \"Psychonaut\" and \"Psychonautics\" have been diversely applied to cover all activities in which altered states of consciousness are utilized to investigate, augment, or enhance the human condition. These activities include ancient ceremonial practices of traditional shamanism, various forms of meditation, trance, yoga, lucid dreaming, sensory deprivation, and the controlled use of hallucinogenic or entheogenic substances. A person who endeavors to explore altered states of consciousness for the purposes mentioned above or any other, may be called a psychonaut. Psychonautics is an inherently unique methodology which depends on the individual. Psychonauts may discover their own methods of exploring their own conscious states. Experiences may be intentionally sought after, but can also be stumbled upon serendipitously. Some methods used by psychonauts are: Art in general can be seen as individuals expressing their conscious states through various mediums such as: books, drawings, sculptures, music, etc. Psychonauts exploring their own conscious states may make ineffable discoveries which are thought of as very difficult to express and understand with the standard human psyche, this has paved a way for artists to attempt to do just that with their creations. Psychedelic substances may have different but somewhat cohesive visual effects, this includes but is not limited to: All of those visual effects may be prevalent in art inspired by the psychedelic experience, especially when the psychonaut attempts to re-create the visual experience through drawings or other artistic mediums. Use of psychonautic methods may result in cognitive effects such as, but not limited to: Psychonauts may attempt to express these cognitive effects through their artwork which can result in very distinct and unique creations in all artistic mediums. Psychedelic music genres such as Ambient, Psytrance, or Psydub are generally seen as genres which are inspired by the psychedelic experience or made to enhance the psychedelic experience. Psychonauts may create listen to these genres (or other) in order to enhance their experiences or lead their experiences a certain way. Artists may also create psychedelic music which express the experiences they've had in altered states of consciousness. An example of various artists producing psychedelic music are: Psychonauts may write experience reports which attempt to convey experiences they've had exploring their consciousness. These trip-reports may differ widely from each-other which is a good statement to how unique experiences can be. Famous books and writings are:",

It is largely characterized by anti-establishment views, the promotion of individual freedom, and the DIY ethics. The culture and its emergence are largely attributed to the music, punk rock, however they likely were molded together rather than separately. The music in question was mainly inspired by rock music in general but with a more loud, abrasive, and acerbic sound. Most punk bands actually rejected the corporate nature of mainstream 1970s rock music. They typically produced short, fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles with stripped-down instrumentation. Then there's one of the most important parts of punk, it's ethos. The punk ethos is primarily made up of beliefs such as non-conformity, anti-authoritarianism, anti-corporatism, do-it-yourself ethics, anti-consumerism, anti-corporate greed, direct action, and not \"selling out\" (i.e. not giving up your beliefs or changing yourself in the name of money and fame). It's unclear exactly when punk started to form but it's largely attributed to the 1970s, following the footsteps of the Hippie movement.  But while the Hippies were more from the white upper middle class, Punk was born from those who were a part of the working class and angry. Which is why most Punks realized that the system was the problem itself, not just creating issues. This led many to preach anarchism, far-left politics, and spitting in the face of the establishment by rejecting the prevailing capitalist philosophy of the time. It's these things that enable Punk as a symbol of rebellion. Punk and what it represents is why some aesthetics with the \"-punk\" suffix generally share an attitude of defiance and/or rejection of mainstream society, but there are some which are completely unrelated. Meanwhile, some people enjoy the visual aspect that came from the 1970s Punk of the USA and UK and reject the philosophy. However most actual Punks would refer to these people as posers since they dress solely for the \"look\" and not what Punk is about. A popular example of this is the 1998 film SLC Punk!, which specifically made fun of people who wore the fashion, but didn't adhere to the ethos, with main character Stevo (played by Matthew Lillard), famously saying towards the beginning of the film: Later on, during the 1980s, the movement of Goth was born from the subgenre of Post-Punk. It's the reason why that subculture has many similar values to Punk, because of that shared history. The fashion commonly associated with the Punk subculture is typically different from other subcultures. Unconventional clothing, hairstyles, cosmetics, jewelry, and even body modifications are popular within many punk scenes because of how society often finds them inappropriate due to not adhering to the beauty standard. Although clothing features tartan plaid pants, band shirts, leather jackets, mohawks, and multi-colored hair, the key element of Punk was the anti-consumerist ideology of wearing clothes either bought at thrift stores or handed down from older family members and modifying it. This is actually where a lot of the plaid and leather came from, it was what was available to them through thrifting and dumpster diving. Something to note is how combat boots are often worn by many Punks. This is because at the time, they were cheaper, durable, and easy to get. Boots such as Doc Martens were considered a standard due to this reason. Battle jackets are a jacket adorned with patches related to the wearer's subculture or general interests. These are generally made using denim jackets or leather jackets, sometimes with the sleeves cut off. They are a prominent part of various subcultures but originated from the United States Army Air Corps during World War II, where airmen would sew patches onto their regulation flight jackets. Upon returning from war, the practice was continued by former airmen who became a part of motorcycle clubs. From there, it eventually made its way to the punk subculture. Typically punk battle jackets will feature bands, political phrases or symbols, as well as other interests. It is also common to see pins added on as well as studs and/or spikes. Lace Code, although largely defunct now, was a way to indicate certain messages depending on the color of your shoe laces on your combat boots. This, of course, only counted if ladder-laced. It started in the skinhead subgroup within the punk movement but soon expanded outside of it. Lace Code also varies from local punk scene to local punk scene. Although it's generally accepted that black laces are no affiliation for example, some lace colors are not as universal. It's always best to ask your local scene to get an idea if there's an active lace code and what that lace code is for this reason. The punk music genre is a massive one and includes over twenty subgenres. Punk is raw and typically played at a fast tempo with aggressive vocals. Lyrical content for punk music ranges from humorous, nonsensical topics to overt statements on political and social issues. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through independent record labels. The term \"punk rock\" was first used by American rock critics in the early 1970s to describe 1960s garage bands and subsequent acts understood to be their stylistic inheritors. When the movement now bearing the name developed between 1974-1976, acts such as Television, Patti Smith, and the Ramones in New York City, the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and the Damned in London, and the Saints in Brisbane formed its vanguard. As 1977 approached, punk became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK. It spawned a punk subculture expressing youthful rebellion through distinctive styles of clothing and adornment (such as deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands and jewelry, safety pins, and bondage and S&M clothes) and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies. Hardcore Punk is a derivation of punk that is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California. Primal screaming, faster tempos and heavily distorted sounding guitar are the major characteristics found in this genre. Lyrics were generally politically charged, and therefore too controversial to air on mainstream media. Hardcore would aim to be very anti-commercial and anti-mainstream. As a result, hardcore is highly influential on a lot of genres, with the most notable being post-hardcore (and everything related to it). Hardcore punk also developed moshing, a style of dance in which audiences participates in “slam dancing” to express anger and a rejection of conformity. The term originated from Bad Brains's lead singer, who commanded his audience to “mash” – but misinterpreted to be “mosh” due to his Jamaican accent. Moshing is now engaged by fans from many genres, such as metal, grunge, and rap. Notable hardcore punk bands include: Bad Brains, Black Flag, Circle Jerks, D.R.I., Minor Threat, Dead Kennedys, S.O.B., SS, The Stalin, and Gauze. Some genres born from hardcore include: Horror Punk is a genre that takes punk, and adds a dash of proto-gothic morbidity to it. Some themes include monster-based stories and sci-fi metaphors. Because of its themes, it often overlaps with (and may even be mistaken for) deathrock. Another genre similar to horror punk is psychobilly, which is horror punk mixed with rockabilly (the most famous example being The Cramps). Horror Punk bands include The Cramps, The Misfits, Blitzkid, and Wednesday 13. Pop Punk is a fusion genre that takes the fast tempo and guitars of punk, with the melodies and chord progression of pop. Due to its mainstream and commercial nature, pop punk is a controversial genre within the punk scene, and entire bands are discredited if they are associated with the genre. However, its often ignored how pop-punk was with punk from the start - Buzzcocks and the Descendents are the most notable examples and have paved the way for the 90s pop-punk bands and their MTV popularity - like Green Day and NOFX. Since 90s, most pop-punk bands are being criticized for signing to major labels and \"selling out\" by making mainstream version of punk rock and MTV music videos. Post-Punk is a genre that formed that averts the standard punk sound. Instead of being fast and aggressive, post-punk has a more muted guitar, prominent bass and a steady drumbeat. Post-Punk singers are also more melancholic rather than energetic. Post-punk bands include Joy Division, Wire and Public Image Ltd. Nu-Punk emerged in the late 1990's and came to prominence in the early 2000's, primarily in the Chicagoland area and New Jersey, but later spread to other regions.  It's generally much less overtly political than other punk genres and tends to focus more on general themes of personal struggle, feeling downtrodden, and having a good time, not a long time. Crustpunk (also known as crust) is a form of music influenced by English punk rock and extreme metal. The style, which evolved in the early-1980s in England, often has songs with dark and pessimistic lyrics that linger on political and social ills. Crustpunk differs slightly from punk in general, as the “crust” comes from being dirty or making things yourself, sometimes out of trash. This makes it similar to grunge. Riot Grrrl is punk, but through a more feminist lens. What originally started with zines calling for women to be allowed into punk spaces, Riot grrrl turned into a revolutionary music movement of its own in the 90s. Despite proclaiming to be progressive, many females still felt the punk scene was predominantly male. Therefore, the goal of Riot grrrl was to allow female punks to be heard, and have a space of their own. Riot grrrl bands include Bikini Kill and Bratmobile, all the way to Sleater-Kinney. Riot Grrrl bands often address feminist issues in songs, such as sexual-assault, rape, beauty expectations, image issues, and more. Ska Punk is another fusion genre between punk, with the Jamaican-born genre ska. In late 70s, a new wave of ska was born - nowadays called 2 Tone. It reached it highest point of mainstream in the 90s as being more influenced by hardcore - the originating bands are Fishbone and Mighty Might BossTones - and more famous are - No Doubt, Rancid, Reel Big Fish and Less Than Jake. Taqwacore is a subgenre of punk music dealing with Islam beliefs, its culture, and its interpretation. The scene is composed mainly of young Muslim artists living in the US and other Western countries, many of whom openly reject traditionalist interpretations of Islam, and thus live their lifestyle within the religion or without. While the name Taqwacore was coined by Michael Muhammad Knight in his 2003 novel The Taqwacores, Taqwacore has roots in Muslim punk music from the 1990s. Bands in Taqwacore include The Kominas, Secret Trial Five, and Al Thawra. Despite being somewhat varied in political and social beliefs, punk political identity consists primarily of individual freedom and anti-establishment beliefs. Punk also largely follows Do It Yourself / DIY ideals, in rejection of corporate ownership of the music scene. Many use second-hand equipment, and/or clothing, as a statement against consumerist ideologies. Some participate in direct action in both peaceful, and more violent means of achieving goals; protest, rioting, eco-sabotage, squatting, legal and illegal graffiti, boycotting, vandalism,  and other methods are used to express their ideologies. Punk also promotes concepts like gender equality, racial equality, health rights, civil rights, animal rights, disability rights, and LGBT+ rights. Overall, punk ideologies are mainly leftist, and anti-capitalist, with focuses on equality. Frequently it can be found that punk subculture is opposed to \"Selling Out\", meaning abandoning social values, musical style, or political ideology in order to gain status, wealth or power. Punk has grown over time and its ideologies have expanded in variety, and now it is more common than before to find punks that follow and/or fight for concepts such as Animal Rights / Veganism, Straight Edge and Leftism. There are certain groups and individuals identify as part of punk subculture while holding fascist, racist or Neo-Nazi views (See Hatecore). This, alongside some other groups such as conservative punks, is seen by almost all of punk subculture as opposed to punk's history and ethos, and there is an active, heavy push to reject it from punk subculture altogether. This can be seen time and time again, for example Green Day's anti-racist and anti-fascist messages during the 2016 American Music Awards, and the Dead Kennedys song \"Nazi Punks Fuck Off\".",

Queencore may consist of more adult-like themes, like politics and war, so it is assumed to be more heavy-handed than Princesscore. Inspiration can be drawn from matriarchal figures in hierarchy-centered shows and movies, especially those centered around kingdoms. Queencore aesthetics show through strength and guidance, skill and patience. Those who adopt a Queencore aesthetic may be seen as the leader of a group. They hold themselves to higher standards, as a way to show worthiness of their title and position. The Queencore aesthetic wouldn't be complete without confidence and displays of good leadership. For a darker approach, colors can be toned deeper, and inspiration can be drawn from evil queen characters. This aesthetic can be great inspiration for modern styles. Most visuals can be taken from castle exteriors, interiors, and grounds. This can include throne rooms, royal chambers, and gardens. Examples include: Fashion may be taken directly from historical accounts or may be modernized. Real life examples can include historical figures like Queen Victoria for a more historical approach, or figures like Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle for more modern fashion. Fictional examples can include Queen Calanthe from The Witcher, Cersei Lannister from Game of Thrones, Mary, Queen of Scots from Reign, and The Countess from American Horror Story (for a more creative twist). Staples include intricate embroidery, beading, jewel and metal embellishments, darker or richer colors, and long sleeves.

The genre features a distinctive record production style, drum machine-backed rhythms, pitch corrected vocals, and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. This aesthetic is a more chill, relaxed, and laid-back sub-aesthetic/sub-genre of Baddie. R&B visuals can vary, however neon lights and red, purple, blue and pink LED lighting are not uncommon. R&B visuals usually have a slight sensual feel due to the fact that a lot of the music is about love,as well as heartbreak and other strong emotional topics. Contemporary R&B is a form of music that emerged in the US in the early 1980s. The style mixes the vocal techniques associated with earlier R&B genres and Disco, with a form of synthesized and smooth production characterized by lush arrangements, and electronically programmed rhythms sometimes influenced by Hip Hop. Contemporary R&B has been intrinsically connected to the rise of certain forms of Pop music, and to pop music in general. Contemporary R&B sticks to typical pop songwriting and is almost universally based in verse-chorus structures. Lyrically, the genre is nearly always about love, romance, and relationships, though many artists have written songs discussing other subjects. The roots of the genre go back to the late disco era, when producer Quincy Jones created a more eclectic and smoother sound that was still derived from disco, but already presented a departure from it. The resulting album, Off the Wall, served as an important early point for the genre. Hip hop became an increasingly prominent influence in the genre throughout the 1980s, both in production and the later incorporation of rapping. This influence was manifested in New Jack Swing in particular. The sound of contemporary R&B underwent changes in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the earlier reliance on synth-heavy production was replaced with dominant influence from newer hip hop styles like Boom Bap. Neo-Soul emerged in the mid-to-late 1990s in the US and the UK, characterized by the incorporation of 1970s Soul influences and other older Afro American genres onto a palette of hip hop and contemporary R&B production. Contemporary R&B enjoyed a period of massive commercial success and popularity in the 2000s. The genre became frequently mixed with Pop Rap, Dance-Pop, and Electropop, in addition to other forms of popular music. The deliberate use of auto-tune, which would become much more widespread in the 2010s, was also introduced then. The 2010s introduced a number of new prominent influences in R&B production, from the rhythms of Trap and certain post-Dubstep trends to the growing popularity of 2010s Electronic Dance Music genres in mainstream music. The former partially resulted in the emergence of Alternative R&B. The growing popularity of trap music was further manifested in the music of many popular artists, who utilized the genre's rhythms for their singing, with many other trap artists creating seamless blends of both genres. While many artists from the decade attempted to create more futuristic, colorful R&B music with heavier electronic elements, the 2010s also saw a prominent nostalgia wave that revived 1980s production styles. Contemporary R&B's global influence has resulted in its sustained influence over many other popular music genres, including Afrobeats, Dancehall, Reggaetón, amongst others. Despite that, the main center where most popular R&B musicians originate from remains firmly rooted in the Anglophone world. Alternative R&B is a movement of R&B music that began around the late 2000s that deviates from the traditional styles, timbres and sometimes subject matter of Contemporary R&B. A typical alternative R&B song features subtle, smooth, and reverberated production, heavy bass and often reverberated vocals. The sounds are often linked to Dream Pop, Future Garage, and UK Bass for their reverberated, airy, and bass-heavy sound. Many releases by alternative R&B artists have tracks that were produced by UK bass and future garage producers, such as Jessie Ware's single \"Running\", which was produced by Julio Bashmore, and Jamie Woon's single \"Night Air\", which was co-produced by Burial. In some cases, such as Jai Paul and The Weeknd, producer/singers also sing over their own produced music in an R&B style. The subject matter and lyricism of alternative R&B is sometimes more vague and more varied than that of the often strictly love and sex themed contemporary R&B parent genre. Some themes may include but are not limited to drugs, spirituality and personal philosophies; however, themes of sex and love are still often the focal point of most lyrical content in the genre.

The many styles which encompass \"pluggnb\" are different departures from the initial xangang sound, with each scene incorporating \"r&b\" in different ways. the departure which focuses on cheap-sounding vst leads, and extended chords has now led to this sound, which pretty much drops plugg entirely. it's also not certain whether \"r&b beats\" will stick as a name, its whats used by some producers though.

It has much overlap with Scene, Glowwave, Old Web, Holosexual, Kidcore, and Decora. Rainbowcore visuals can either focus on the rainbow as a whole or one specific color of the rainbow: For more information on how to properly utilize these colors, see Color Theory. On top of the standard 7-color rainbow, Rainbowcore visuals can also include iridescent, photochromatic, or thermochromatic color shifting. However, this doesn't include Holographic or UV-Reactive/Glow in the Dark effects. This particular flavor of Rainbowcore visuals work best when shown off in a format that shows off motion, such as GIFs or movies, to get the full effect. There are examples of crystals, cars, and even food that can utilize the effect, but to simply look at a still image, while it can get the idea of color-shifting across, it's not ideal for the full effect. The best example of this in nature is the Chameleon, which will change colors to show its internal body temperature or mood (contrary to popular belief, chameleons don't change their appearance to blend into their surrounds; all one has to do is look at the many brightly-colored chameleons out there to know that this belief is absolute nonsense), though other animals that can achieve this effect include the octopus. Rainbowcore fashion is very colorful and vibrant, almost like you're wearing a rainbow. It is popularly used in a lot of fashion items, especially with clothing tied to Seapunk, Slimepunk, Icepunk, Vaporwave, Milleniwave, and Y2K Futurism aesthetics due to their favoring of bright and vivid colors. One such example of this in action is a Thermochromatic pigment that leads to a \"Mood Ring\" effect; while it's typically reserved for the titular fashion accessory, some people can utilize the crystals used to make the \"mood ring\" effect and apply it to shoes and other clothing items to create a truly unique look (and one YouTube channel, DipYourCar, has even taken this a step further and applied this to a car). If one doesn't want to buy pre-made items, it is possible to find the pigments online and use them on DIY fashion projects as a form of dye. This particular aesthetic has been popular across internet culture for some time; many of the most popular content include car wraps, culinary art pieces, abstract videos that are designed to look like a digital kaleidoscope of sorts.

Ravencore is similar to, but not the same as, Crowcore. Ravencore is a nature-centered aesthetic, taking inspiration from ravens themselves. In nature, ravens generally prefer undisturbed mountainous or forested areas over urban areas (unlike crows); feed on scavenged carrion, small invertebrates, and insects; gather in groups (though they are usually seen alone or in pairs); and are known to hoard shiny objects. Ravencore is built around these basic principles. The aesthetic is characterized by collecting items of interest, as well as building friendship with corvids and having a broad respect for nature. The style embraces the elegance of misty, mossy, shaded forests. If you are looking for a grittier, muddier, and brighter aesthetic you may want to consider Goblincore. Ravens, followers of the ravencore aesthetic, are often very prideful of their collection and enjoy displaying and sharing it with others. Ravens often collect: Followers of the ravencore aesthetic are often at peace when surrounded by nature. Mossy forests, mountains, ferns and mushrooms, slow-trickling creeks, the scent of petrichor, the twinkling of stars at night, and the soft glow of fireflies are all commonly calming themes within the aesthetic. Members are also often comforted by old books, mossy stone houses, and spending time with fellow ravens. Gardening and caring for plants or animals is also a common theme within the aesthetic. The aesthetic is very inclusive, with groups striving to ensure that everyone is welcome. While the aesthetic is not a movement, it often rejects the normal roles of society and its members can be seen working against injustice and towards equality.",

Raves are an organized dance party at a nightclub, outdoor festival, warehouse, private property, or illegally on public property. These parties typically feature performances by DJs, playing a seamless flow of electronic dance music. DJs at rave events play electronic dance music on vinyl, CDs, and digital audio from a wide variety of genres, including but not limited to Techno, Hardcore Techno, House, Bassline, Dubstep, Industrial and New Beat. Ravers commonly wear clothing that is bright and/or neon coloured. In many ways, the Madchester scene laid the groundwork for today's raver aesthetic. Madchester, the predecessor to modern raver culture, is a melon-twisting musical and cultural scene that developed in the English city of Manchester in the late 1980s. It saw artists merging alternative rock with elements of Acid House, rave music, psychedelia, and 1960s pop. Madchester's decline gave way to the Britpop sound that became popular in the mid-1990s thanks to bands like Blur and Oasis. Madchester was known for having a very rich drug scene, with the popular drug of choice being ecstasy (aka MDMA/Molly); in fact, Madchester band The Shamen put out a song called \"Ebeneezer Goode\" which was coded to be all about dropping E (i.e. Ebeneezer's shortened name was Eezer, which in the chorus he was referred to as \"'Eezer Goode, 'Eezer Goode / He's Ebeneezer Goode\", the first part of which is aurally identical to, \"Es are good\", among other lines in the song). Madchester fashion is the main reason for another name for the genre; Baggy. Baggy pants and shorts were quite popular back in Madchester's heyday and were often accompanied by tie-dye shirts of some sort. It can best be described as equal parts raver, hippie/retro (for its time), and football hooligan. Over time, however, as Madchester/raver culture became more mainstream, raver fashion moved away from the warehouse parties into more extensive venues and outdoor spaces. Some of the new raver fashion that's come about includes: The musical genre most commonly associated with Ravers is Electronic Dance Music, which has a really wide variety of subgenres (there are at least, over 130 subgenres counted). Electronic Dance Music was pioneered in the second half of the 1970s by producers such as Giorgio Moroder or Cerrone, who developed Electro-Disco, replacing influences of early Disco, like R&B or Soul, by electronic sounds, using synthesizers, drum machines, faster bpm and metronomic, monotonous rhythms. Electro-Disco quickly spawned other subgenres such as Italo-Disco or Hi-NRG. House music was pioneered in the early 1980s and Techno in the mid-1980s. During the 1980s Electronic Dance Music became the dominant force of dance music and it evolved quickly into different genres, with the introduction and increased affordability of new instruments such as the Roland TR-808 drum machine, the Roland TB-303 synthesizer, the Akai Samplers, and technological standards like MIDI. In 1987-88 House went mainstream and DJs became stars, spawning a whole Electronic Dance Music culture that lasts to these days. In the 1990s EDM was massively popular, particularly in Europe, and genres such as Hardcore [EDM], Eurodance and Trance were developed. Electronic Dance Music genres are commonly categorized based on beats per minute (bpm), the slowest tempos range from 60-90 bpm, whereas genres such as Speedcore surpass an average of 240 bpm. Genres are also defined by the usage of melody, for instance Happy Hardcore is upbeat and catchy in contrast to Terrorcore. Eurodance is melodic, Pop oriented and popular amongst non-clubbers, in contrast to genres like Schranz or Hard Trance, which are more underground and aimed only for clubbers. In the 2010s, Electronic Dance Music was more successful than ever, and was one of the most popular styles of music even in the US Top 40 Charts. Below are the list of EDM subgenres: Drum and bass (also written as Drum&Bass or drum'n'bass and commonly abbreviated as D&B, DnB, or D'n'B) is a genre of electronic music characterised by fast breakbeats (typically 165-185 beats per minute) with heavy bass and sub-bass lines, samples, and synthesizers. The genre grew out of the UK's jungle scene in the early 1990s. There have also been many subgenres and fusions of DnB. Artists include: Artcore is a subgenre part of EDM, and it was mainly popularized by the BEMANI hythm games. It mixes Classical music, Drum and Bass and western European traditional music, and sometimes Trance, Hardcore, Brostep and Electro House music. The songs are generally meant to be emotional and use very characteristic emotional atmospheres. They also mix acoustic music with electronic music. The most commonly used instruments are pianos and electric guitars. Breakcore is a form of Hardcore [EDM] characterized by the use of complex chopped breakbeats. Breakcore songs are typically noisy and chaotic, and often feature samples from a variety of media including music, movies, and video games. Breakcore was pioneered in the mid-1990s by Alec Empire, who took the chopped breakbeats of Jungle and Drum and Bass and mixed them with the noise and aggression of Digital Hardcore and Gabber. The influence of digital hardcore on many early breakcore producers yielded a significant amount of Hardcore Punk influence that would largely disappear as the genre spread throughout Europe and the United States via the rave community. The genre continued to build popularity throughout the 2000s and 2010s, splintering into many different styles. Canadian producer Venetian Snares is largely responsible for bringing breakcore to a wider audience in the mid-2000s through albums such as Rossz csillag alatt született and The Chocolate Wheelchair Album, combining Breakcore with elements of Drill, Bass and Modern Classical. At the same time, the common fusion of Breakcore with Digital Hardcore would be elaborated into a more modern fusion of Breakcore and Metal by artists such as Drumcorps and Igorrr. In the 2010s, breakcore would begin to see a return to the noisiness and rampant sampling of the 1990s and 2000s through artists such as Renard and goreshit, who became very popular on YouTube and other internet platforms with breakcore that was lighter in tone (owing in part to influence from genres such as Happy Hardcore and Breakbeat Hardcore) and which sampled extensively from popular music as well as video games, anime, and internet memes. These artists would influence the development of subgenres such as Mashcore and Lolicore specifically built around extensive sampling. Denpa, also known as Akiba-Pop, is a Japanese underground musical genre part of Electronic Dance Music. Denpa songs are fast, strange and catchy and contain awkward and/or dissonant lyrics and other characteristics such as cute high-pitched vocals and Kawaii aesthetics. The lyrics are Otaku-related and nonsensical, so in Japan the genre also got a negative connotation because it was thought to be controlling people's minds, and Otakus were seen as delusional people at the time. Although the music sounds happy and cute, the most common themes in Denpa music are delusion, telepathy and insanity, and it could also come off as creepy because of the repetitive lyrics and chaotic tone. Other common characteristics of Denpa music are off-key vocals, repetitive chants and onomatopoeia. The Denpa musical genre is also directly related to the Denpa videogame/anime genre as it took a heavy inspiration from it. Denpa music is also popular in Japanese rhythm games such as Beatmania or SDVX and Japanese Doujin circles. Releases of Denpa music often happen in Doujin events such as Comiket. A common misconception is that Denpa music is just a Otaku, Kawaii and Creepy spin-off of J-Pop, but they both share very distinct musical scenes as J-Pop is mainstream while Denpa stays underground. [plagiarized] Lolicore is a genre of Breakcore characterized by heavily distorted or high-pitched anime vocal samples and complex cut-up breakbeats with extreme tempos. Songs are short, usually running anywhere from a few seconds to around three minutes. Lolicore vocals are normally accomplished in a number of ways, either by speeding up a normal-sounding voice or song to sound more high-pitched, using already \"childlike\" samples, generally from anime, or chopping/slicing vocal samples and making them more acute. Themes range from otaku culture, primarily lolicon media and anime in general, to Japanese culture as a whole. The usual breakcore intensity along with the use of manipulated samples provides a unique tonal contrast and a nonstop barrage of noises. Kusoikore, a more specific form of the genre developed by CDR, increases even more the harsh and chaotic sound of lolicore. While lolicore is frequently influenced by Mashcore and breakcore at large, it also takes elements from Nerdcore Techno, Noise, and other Hardcore [EDM] genres, usually Speedcore. Future Bass is an umbrella term for a genre or technique in electronic dance music emphasizing modulated synthesizer bass sounds.  The sound waves are often modulated using automation or low-frequency oscillation controlling the cutoff of an audio filter (typically a low- or high-pass filter), or the wave's amplitude, to adjust the waveform (to create a ‘wobbly’ effect on its parameters). In addition, it is common to utilize a somewhat \"twinkly\"-sounding gradual rise in pitch during \"risers\" (gradual pre-drop buildups of white noise), and arpeggio chords, vocal chops, or vocoders. Artists include: [plagiarized] Kawaii future bass is an aesthetically \"cute\" style of Future Bass rooted in anime and video game culture that developed in the mid-2010s, popularised on SoundCloud and YouTube. Perhaps the most essential and distinctive part of its sound is its Chiptune-inspired synths, often sounding similar to Bitpop, which appear across its more mellow and more uptempo variations. Stylistically, the genre is highly melodic and is often faster than other future bass, sometimes changing to full step or busier rhythms for brief periods to create a chaotic and complex sound. It also frequently incorporates chopped vocal samples and syncopated patterns like those found in Jersey Club, as well as sections influenced by contemporary Electronic Dance Music like Electro House and Dancefloor Drum and Bass. Due to its popularity with Japanese producers, a number of Japanese Pop and Electronic styles have also been an inspiration to kawaii bass, shown by the prominence of J-Pop's sugary pop melodies and parallels to the high energy genre-hopping of Denpa and J-core. Kawaii future bass also often includes sound effects like bed squeaks or animal sounds, uncommon instruments (such as mallets, xylophones, and Japanese instruments), and samples from anime or video games. The genre has its roots in 2013 with Australian producers like Wave Racer and Cosmo's Midnight who built on the most melodic and Video Game Music-inspired elements of Rustie's Glass Swords to create a more overtly melodic and sometimes manic style that would quickly be dubbed \"dofflin\", named with a creative misspelling of \"dolphin\" from the title of an early Cosmo's Midnight track. Though the dofflin scene was short-lived, with its artists later moving onto other forms of future bass, it would lay the groundwork for what would become the cutesy and uptempo style of kawaii future bass through its influence on late 2013 releases by British producer Bo En and Japanese producer Tomggg on influential Japanese netlabel Maltine Records. This would lead to a thriving Japanese scene that would end up fully developing the breadth of the genre, most prominently Snail's House, but also vocalist and producer YUC'e and J-pop group CY8ER (and their producer Yunomi), and the label MEGAREX with many compilations combining the genre with various other EDM styles. The genre would also gain some traction in the United States, with artists like EDM duo Hyper Potions, and Shawn Wasabi, whose sample-heavy \"Marble Soda\" became popular online in 2015 with a live Mashup video. Kawaii future bass would also influence and take influence from Bubblegum Bass through the 2010s, especially with their similar cute aesthetics and the use of feminine, often pitched-up vocals. Hardcore (also known as hardcore techno) is a subgenre of electronic dance music based on the Belgian New Beat industrial style of Techno, which originated in the Netherlands in the 1990s. It is distinguished by faster tempos (160 to 200 BPM or more), the intensity of the kicks and the synthesized bass (in some subgenres), the rhythm and the atmosphere of the themes (sometimes violent), the usage of saturation and experimentation close to that of industrial dance music. It would spawn subgenres such as Mainstream, Gabber, Uptempo, Frenchcore, and Hardstyle. Some examples of artists in this genre are: [plagiarized] Happy Hardcore is a highly energetic form of electronic dance music, developed during the late 1990s, characterised by an extremely fast-paced 4/4 beat, saccharine vocals, piano riffs and spacey effects. Its popularity was generally contained within Europe initially - particularly Britain, Germany and the Netherlands - although in recent years it has spawned record labels worldwide specialising in the genre. In contrast with many other styles of Hardcore [EDM], the genre tends to be very bouncy and upbeat in nature, hence the \"happy\" portion of its name. Some examples of DJs in this genre are: [plagiarized] J-core is a form of Japanese Hardcore [EDM] notable for its energetic fusion of various hardcore styles. It was originally coined by overseas listeners to refer to the otaku-themed sound of DJ Sharpnel, but has since expanded to refer to almost any form of hardcore music perceived as having Japanese sensibilities. Sharpnel’s fusion of Gabber, UK Hardcore, Happy Hardcore, and Speedcore sounds with anime samples gained a cult following among online communities for its liveliness and otaku aesthetic. Their music, known domestically as Nerdcore Techno, provided the foundational elements of J-core, alongside that of other early Japanese hardcore producers such as m1dy and M-Project. Sample-heavy J-core eventually fell out of trend due to copyright law, but in its place grew a new branch of J-core that retained the overly cute and euphoric feel of otaku media while continuing to borrow from a myriad of hardcore and Electronic Dance Music genres with a more contemporary and polished sound. As their audiences generally did not attend real clubs, artists focused less on danceability and instead adopted an excessively energetic style with unpredictable switch-ups in patterns, tempos and even genres altogether; despite this the music is often melodic, catchy and sometimes even Pop-oriented. Some releases even cross over with Denpa, an otaku musical genre similiar to J-Pop, also popular within doujin communities. J-core maintains a strong relationship with anime and video game culture, with most releases being sold independently at doujin fairs. The Touhou Project's doujin scene has been especially fruitful for the genre, spawning some of its biggest names such as REDALiCE and t+pazolite. Rhythm games like Konami's Bemani franchise and SEGA's Performai franchise often use J-core music to soundtrack more difficult and exciting gameplay, and have been widely responsible for both the growing eccentricity of the music itself and the genre's spread. REDALiCE's Hardcore Tano*C label, whose artists regularly feature in Bemani, Performai games and other projects, has also been hugely influential in the community's popularity and sound. Despite its origins, J-core is produced and distributed worldwide. Some producers have toured abroad, and the Shibuya record shop GUHROOVY served as one of the most important promoters of J-core music for many years both domestically and overseas. Meanwhile, international artists have also not only featured on releases but formed overseas labels of their own dedicated to the style. [plagiarized] Frenchcore is a subgenre of Hardcore [EDM] that emerged around the late 1990s primarily in France, that branched off the Industrial Hardcore scene of the era as a contrast to the rougher sound exemplified by the latter genre at the time. Frenchcore began to develop through major hardcore labels Epitéth Records and Psychik Genocide, with producers such as Radium and Micropoint stripping away elements of industrial hardcore music and approaching the sounds of Gabber and Freetekno, which influenced it. It is primarily characterized by TR-909 inspired percussion, bouncy kicks and off-beat basslines, and a tempo around 200 BPM (with some tracks reaching up to 240 BPM). Kick patterns are often less distorted, having 'reverse'-like, pitched bassline sounds, these eventually becoming more prominent in later eras. Frenchcore was initially an underground phenomenon centered in France and Italy. Its popularity resurged in the 2010s, led by veteran and contemporary EDM and hardcore DJs. Speedcore is a subgenre of Hardcore [EDM] known notably for its exceedingly high rate of beats per minute, rarely dropping below 240 bpm. It is distinguished from other forms of Hardcore [EDM] by an aggressive electronic percussion track that is punctuated by rapid snare or tom-tom fills. Extratone is a sub-genre of Speedcore that starts at 1000BPM and has no set BPM boundary. Oftentimes, extratone will have large amounts of static or distortion mixed in with extremely fast blast beats. It's also not uncommon to mix Harsh Noise into the tracks too. When up to speed, extratone will sound more like a buzz, or a hum, rather than actual blast beats. Hypertone is the fastest music genre starts at 2.5 million bpm, Hypertone sound like silence, due to the extremely fast bpm. Splittercore is a faster version of Speedcore with BPM ranging from around 600 through 1000. The stereotypical speedcore blast beats are often intensified to the point of becoming indistinguishable. Splittercore is often mixed with sections of Noise to add to the chaotic nature represented. First appearing independently in Italy and in the Netherlands, hardstyle is a form of Hard Dance that emerged from Hard Trance in the early 2000s, with strong Hardcore [EDM] influences, particularly in the Dutch scene. By the early-to-mid 2000s early hardstyle had become a distinct sound, characterized by its persistent, compressed, repetitive, and hard kick drums, its fast tempo (typically around 150 BPM), and its unique use of the so-called reverse bass (a particular bassline that is reversed in a way that its tail is longer than its front), which is always inserted on the offbeat. Another early development of hardstyle was the introduction of the screech, a distorted, high-pitched synthesizer sound that would become widespread and prominent in later forms of hardstyle. Hardstyle also consisted of further influences from the previously popular Dutch Gabber genre, with Nu Style Gabber in particular influencing and crossing over with the genre during its early years. Developing alongside hardstyle, Jumpstyle was an associated sound that appeared in Belgium around 2002. Characterized by its more accessible, danceable sound influenced by UK Hard House, Euro-Trance (Hands Up in particular), and Happy Hardcore, Jumpstyle became more closely associated with hardstyle in later years and would remain an influence even after it commercially died out in the mid-to-late 2000s. The end of the 2000s saw major hardstyle producers shifting their sound in a more melodic and accessible direction, incorporating influences of Uplifting Trance, Vocal Trance, hands up and Euro-trance into a hardstyle subgenre that came to be known as Euphoric Hardstyle. Euphoric hardstyle further became distinct from earlier hardstyle offshoots by commonly featuring vocals, typically by female singers who deliver highly emotional, passionate performances. While euphoric hardstyle kept the genre's high BPM ranges and harsh, prominent kick drums, it became a lot closer in sound to many of EDM's Pop-related derivatives in the 2010s. Euphoric hardstyle dominated the hardstyle scene throughout the 2010s, with many music festivals, labels, and DJs centered around the genre. Partially as a reaction to euphoric hardstyle's success, a particular sound known as Rawstyle soon emerged in the late 2000s and early 2010s, featuring producers reviving earlier elements of the genre with more pronounced influences of gabber and Industrial Hardcore. The resulting sound was a minimalistic, repetitive, noisy, and harsh genre (usually screech-rich as well), which would be criticized for its uniformity and repetitiveness by some hardstyle listeners. Despite that, the sound would remain a prominent, if underground, hardstyle subgenre throughout the 2010s, with some producers even pioneering a specific sound known as \"Rawphoric\" that notoriously blends euphoric hardstyle's melodic, highly emotional drops with rawstyle's harsh productions. Hardstyle's global popularity throughout the 2000s and 2010s allowed producers from many different backgrounds to blend its sound with other forms of EDM. This phenomenon became particularly common in the 2010s, with certain producers making multi-genre tracks with multiple drops that often included hardstyle drops or hardstyle influences as well. Similarly, Dubstyle was a micro-genre that attempted to mix hardstyle with late 2000s Dubstep trends (mostly Brostep); Lento violento, an Italo Dance-derived mid-2000s genre, became mixed with hardstyle in the works of Italian DJs in the late 2000s and 2010s; and Hard Trap, a Trap [EDM] variant, was heavily influenced by rawstyle's distorted percussion and leads, often incorporating full-time hardstyle drops. Emerging in the early 2010s, rawstyle is a form of Hardstyle characterized by its incorporation of earlier hardstyle and Hardcore [EDM] influences (particularly Gabber and Industrial Hardcore) into the sound of 2010s hardstyle, creating a distinctly harsh, simplistic, raw, and dark sound, with bpm's usually faster than previous hardstyle trends (around 150-155 bpm). Rawstyle was in part born as a counter-reaction to the growth of Euphoric Hardstyle, a prominent 2010s hardstyle strain that ditched the genre's former harsh, simple drops and replaced them with highly emotional and melodic drops, and often included vocals as well. Many of rawstyle's early artists actively sought to create music in direct contrast to euphoric hardstyle, which was achieved through the re-incorporation of older, more \"traditional\" hardstyle and hardcore styles. Despite that, the initial resulting sound wasn't a revival or replication of earlier trends, with track structures often remaining loyal to the shorter, simpler track lengths of 2010s EDM and with production quality remaining firmly rooted in modern EDM production, in contrast with the 1990s simpler equipment and production gear. Rawstyle's distorted, compressed, hard-hitting, and heavily side-chained kicks and rhythms typically have a main role in the track, with melodies and complex atmospheres only acting as a secondary layer. Manipulated, high-pitched synthesizer stabs known as \"screeches\" are a common feature as well, and their usual role is to accompany the rhythms rather than to play a melody. Reverse basses, chaotic and powerful drops, tense vocal samples (sometimes directly taken from sci-fi/horror cinema), and gloomy, ominous atmospheres and melodies are commonly incorporated as well. Though rawstyle is often relatively simplistic, with producers of the genre receiving criticism for their repetitive, similar music and \"predictable\" compositions, certain producers have become known for more experimental, unconventional styles of rawstyle. The genre's aesthetic and typical art style commonly features apocalyptic, anti-authoritarian, or horror-related imagery and titles, which is often used as an extension of the music's inherent atonal and scary nature. Rawstyle's initial wave of artists was led by music labels such as Dutch Minus Is More and A2 Records, Fusion Records, Australian Spoontech Records, and Italian Hardstyle, who embraced the sound. The sound has continued to mutate since its earliest beginning and it continued to be popular among hardstyle fans throughout the 2010s. Despite attracting audiences in various countries, the style has become especially prominent in the Dutch hardstyle scene, thereby acting as a continuation of the \"classic\" style of 2000s Dutch hardstyle. Prominent Dutch artists of the genre include newcomers from like Radical Redemption, Act of Rage, E-Force, D-Sturb, and Warface, though the style has attracted some older established artists. An even more intense, \"rawer\", and sometimes faster derivative of rawstyle, variously named \"Xtra Raw\" or \"Uptempo Raw\", developed as well towards the late 2010s, further pushing rawstyle towards EDM hardcore regions (sometimes by directly implementing influences of other hardcore genres), and the style has commonly crossed over with Uptempo Hardcore, and more rarely even Frenchcore and Terrorcore. This form of rawstyle is sometimes contrasted with another development of the sound, usually called \"Rawphoric\", \"Melodic Rawstyle\" or \"Euphoric Rawstyle\", which blends rawstyle's distorted and harsh kicks with the melodies and synth leads of euphoric hardstyle, sometimes even incorporating vocals as well. Hardbass is a subgenre of Scouse House that originated from Russia in the early 2000s. It's characterized by bouncy hard bass beats (also known as donk bass), fast tempo, usually 150-175 BPM and occasional lyrics or rapping. DJ Snat, Sonic Mine and XS Project are known for being the pioneers. The most notable success of the genre is \"Tri Poloski\", reaching the mainstream with millions of plays. The genre has become a central stereotype of the gopnik subculture, which refers to young men of lower-class suburban areas coming from families of poor education and limited income. It is commonly associated with the use of Adidas tracksuits, squatting and drinking vodka, being part of the genre aesthetic. Due to the genre's growing popularity, hardbass scenes have begun springing up in several European countries in the 2010s. Emerging in the SoundCloud underground rap scene in the late 2010s, hexd is a musical approach and a form of Electronic music characterized by heavily bit-crushed, sometimes sped-up and pitched-up vocals (particularly in the case of remixed material), and highly compressed and distorted production, typically made from existing material of genres such as Trap, Cloud Rap, Emo Rap on one hand and Trance, Breakbeat and other Electronic Dance Music styles on the other. With additional sound effects like delay and heavy reverberation, the genre aims to encapsulate a dreamy, murky, surreal atmosphere, sometimes used to create a sense of nostalgia, though many artists may instead focus on futuristic, near-mechanic ambiance. The genre is occasionally influenced by the hyper-real, mystical, and self-satirizing sound and aesthetic associated with Vaporwave and other genres in the bigger Vapor movement, with certain producers borrowing elements of the sample manipulation and processing typical of these genres. Originally developed by the Hexcastcrew group, hexd began attracting attention with the group's member cargoboym's Rare RCB hexD.mp3 mix, made from existing Reptilian Club Boyz tracks, whose sample-rich music and unique aesthetic would remain influential for hexd in the following years. The genre would grow exponentially during the next two years, spawning many similar DJ mixes generally based on Hip Hop material, but also on a variety of EDM genres. The distinct DJing style that emerged further incorporated Nightcore, Florida fast music, and Chopped and Screwed, with producers incorporating the aforementioned editing techniques by speeding up, cutting, and compressing existing tracks into a \"hexd\" wall of sound. The main derivative that developed from hexd came to be known as \"crushed trap\", a term popularized by 999 Heartake Sabileye who used it for their many mixes of the genre, remixing and heavily bit-crushing existing trap songs into a hazy pool of \"hexd\" ambiance. A competing term (or, in some interpretations - an affiliated style) for the derivative form of psychedelic, sped-up, and glitchy trap music is \"surge\", coined by Kittenpuke and popularized by Dismiss Yourself - whose label Dismiss Yourself and YouTube channel would become a central hub for the genre. Many of hexd's prominent artists were also featured in Dismiss Yourself's Surge Compilation Vol. 1. With many of its listeners and producers affiliated with the Rate Your Music community, the genre became an influence on other styles of internet rap and electronic music, like the SpaceGhostPurrp and BMB Deathrow-affiliated dark trap genre, certain styles of SoundCloud-based cloud rap and Pop Rap like the late 2010s-born Digicore trend, and even Wave and Bubblegum Bass. Another prominent derivative of the sound includes a form of hexd/crushed trance mixes, led by producers such as Sienna Sleep, Visavril, and iANO. A prominent visual style of artists of the genre is commonly characterized by a distinct low-quality, DIY, \"deep-internet\" aesthetic that seeks to provoke video game/2000s nostalgia, and pictures/visual elements are commonly taken (and edited) directly from Anime series. Dariacore, also known as Hyperflip, is a micro-musical subgenre of Electronic Dance Music invented by Jane Remover (AKA Leroy) which merges popular 2000s-2010s songs with YouTube Poop/SoundClown samples, Digicore, Hyperpop, Future Bass, Mashcore and Nightcore and twists the musical samples to the point where they become their own unique thing. Common characteristics of Dariacore songs include mood changes, mood flips, genre flips and random samples. The genre appeared in the early 2020s with the album Dariacore by Leroy, named after the show Daria. This album developed a cult following in social media due to its internet culture-related samples. A lot of Dariacore songs are also inspired by pre-existing media such as TV shows and videogames. Jungle is a rave-oriented Electronic Dance Music style that is now known as the forerunner of most Drum and Bass genres. It originated in the early 1990s when Breakbeat Hardcore producers from labels like Suburban Base Records and Reinforced Records began experimenting with faster tempos, deeper basslines, and more complex songwriting. The main characteristics of jungle are tempos of 160 BPM and up, largely sample-based production, energetic or chaotic-sounding drum breaks, a strong bassline, and sometimes piano/synth chord riffs based on Hardcore [EDM] and House music from the era. The earliest jungle records, such as those produced by Rufige Kru and Bay B Kane, used the sounds of breakbeat hardcore and emphasized the dark atmosphere and basslines, in parallel with Darkside. This style, sometimes known as \"jungle techno\", helped establish other dark-sounding drum and bass genres like Hardstep and Darkstep. In contrast, other artists, such as Foul Play and Nookie, kept the more melodic, upbeat rave sound. In the mid-1990s, this kind of jungle became more relaxed and chilled-out, using less frantic breakbeats and focusing more strongly on atmosphere and melodies. This would be a blueprint for Atmospheric Drum and Bass. Later developments include the proliferation of Reggae and Hip Hop-focused elements and samples, often fused with the aforementioned darkside and uplifting styles, and headlined by Remarc and Tom and Jerry. This became the most popular style of the jungle sound that received the most airplay, and was later influential in the creation of other styles of dance music such as Ragga Jungle, Breakcore, and Drumfunk. Jungle began to decline in the late 1990s as newer drum and bass styles became more popular, but it still has a huge underground following to this period. A particularly strong resurgence began in the late 2010s as producers explored the possibilities modern music production techniques and software have for the style, as well as fusions with other styles of uptempo electronic dance music like Footwork. As described above, Madchester (also known as Baggy) music combined alternative rock with acid house, techno, psychedelica and the 1960's pop sound, with some of the big bands in the scene primarily coming from Manchester (hence the name). The music first started gaining headway from a club called the Haçienda (owned by members of legendary New Wave band New Order) and kicked off what came \nto be known as The Second Summer of Love. Bands within the genre include: It was being predicted at the time that Madchester would become the defining sound of the 90's, but other genres (such as grunge) prevented it to ever happen. The Madchester sound eventually gave way to the rise of shoegaze and britpop; so while Madchester didn't become the decade-defining sound, it did continue to be an influential genre of music in its own right. As time went on, however, the psychedelica and indie rock vibes started falling away from the raver sound in favor of a more purely electronic sound, which gave rise to techno, trance, jungle, drum 'n bass, and so on, arriving into the era of modern EDM, which can be separated into its subgenres. Mákina, also known as Bakalao, is an electronic musical genre that developed in Spain during the 1990s, along with the Raver subculture. Along with the rise of Clubbing culture and the Ruta Destroy in Valencia (Spain), Mákina became extremely successful all over Spain, the northeast of the UK and even Japan, and to a lesser extent, France. The songs are characterized by their bouncy and danceable electronic rhythm and. Mákina songs are fast paced and usually have a tempo of 150 to 180 BPM. Mákina music was also heavily influenced by Acid House, Industrial Dance Music, New Beat, Hardcore Techno and UK Hardcore. Dubstep is a genre of Electronic Dance Music that emerged in South London in the early 2000s, characterized by half-time syncopated and sparse beats set around 140 BPM with heavy sub-basses. Dubstep commonly relies on dark, nocturnal, spacious, and \"urban\" atmospheres, though it has seen significant variation throughout time. The genre has its origins in the 'nu-dark swing' / 'dark garage' scene of the turn of the millenium, which featured a style of dark, echoey mixes derived from instrumental 2-Step. It also traces its roots to Drum and Bass's bass drops and to Dub's rewind effects and spacious sound. Emerging at around the same time as the similarly UK Garage-derived Grime, the two often influenced each other, though dubstep is usually just instrumental or supplemented with vocal samples, only occasionally featuring MCs. Dubstep's early scene was made up of producers, such as Zed Bias, El-B, Benny Ill, and Oris Jay, who aimed to incorporate some of the bassy-er experimentation of DnB into 2-step, also associated with the Breakstep offshoot. 'Dark garage' developed into early dubstep by a group of artists associated with the label Big Apple Records, with Benga, Artwork, and Skream eschewing 2-step's drum patterns in favor of early versions of 'half-time' rhythms, which became quintessential in dubstep. As dubstep became established in UK clubs around from the mid-2000s, it began to diversify, spawning various developments. Burial's Future Garage represented a shift back to older garage rhythms that still carried dubstep's atmosphere; Joker's Purple Sound style incorporated Synth Funk-influenced synth leads into dubstep and grime-inspired rhythms; some producers around that time began to produce a style known as \"tearout dubstep\", featuring more complex, atonal, and gritty sound design; another style known as Riddim, featuring triplet-based rhythms and LFO-based leads spawned around then. Despite many stylistic splits, dubstep's overall sound remained consistent, with its popularity helping its spread beyond the UK into other scenes worldwide. Around the late 2000s dubstep would split into two different, broad developments. First, a US-centric wave that began to incorporate Electro House influences and buildup-drop structures that gradually replaced dubstep's original dark, minimalistic sound, later developing into the aggressive Brostep, the uplifting Melodic Dubstep, and the more laid-back, Downtempo-inspired Chillstep. The second post-dubstep wave was centered around the UK, featuring experimentation, variations on dubstep's rigid format, and eclectic influences from IDM, Footwork, and Techno styles, all of which would coalesce into UK Bass. Later developments in dubstep resulted in a distinct dark, skeletal and gloomy style known as Dungeon Sound. Despite having generally lost its popularity and status it enjoyed in the 2000s, dubstep remains popular in underground record labels and avenues. Artists within this genre include: Brostep is an offshoot of Dubstep that emerged in the late 2000s, emphasizing aggressive and typically atonal mid-range synth leads and a more polished, less nocturnal, and atmospheric sound. Brostep typically lacks dubstep's repetitive, freeform and hypnotic sound, instead focusing on buildups and drops like other popular 2010s Electronic Dance Music genres. Mostly pioneered and popularized by North American producers and labels, brostep's growth also represented a major stylistic and geographic shift away from the UK's 2000s dubstep sound. Though the genre was met with heavy criticism by both older dubstep fans and mainstream media as it became popular in the 2010s, often ridiculed for its \"robotic\" or \"nasty\" sound, it became the most popular dubstep derivative in the 2010s. Originally coined as a joke by UK producer Kozee, the term was embraced by some producers and fans of the sound (progressively more and more as it got older), though it is still widely rejected by most of its producers and affiliated labels and communities, who simply it call it dubstep. Despite finding popularity in the US and Canada, brostep was originally pioneered by British dubstep veterans Rusko and Caspa - whose mix Fabriclive.37 is often noted as an important early release - and Coki, who began to use higher-pitched synth leads than their contemporaries and an overall \"sillier\", catchier and more party-suited sound. Excision and other producers on his Rottun Recordings label were developing a similar sound, derived from an earlier gritty style known as \"tearout dubstep\". The growing influence of Electro House, the shift towards drop-focused tracks, and the arrival of producers such as Borgore, Flux Pavilion, 16bit, SKisM, Dirtyphonics, and Nero would begin brostep's period of massive popularity and growth between 2010 and 2014 - best exemplified by Skrillex's commercial success. Various labels like Never Say Die would help to bring innovation into the sound, leading to diverse developments: Drumstep, mixing brostep with Drum and Bass drum patterns and BPM, especially Jump-Up; Deathstep, a more intense and distorted variant; and \"briddim\", mixing brostep leads with Riddim's triplets and swampy sound; hybrid trap, blending brostep with Trap [EDM]. Brostep's distinct synth leads would also influence many other 2010s EDM genres that sometimes borrowed its mechanic, complex sound design, including but not limited to the many 2010s Electro House derivates (Midtempo Bass, Complextro, Bass House, etc.), Glitch Hop [EDM], Dancefloor Drum and Bass, and even certain UK Hardcore styles. Brostep is also sometimes mixed with the other 2010s-born Melodic Dubstep genre, resulting in a style coined as Colour Bass by Chime. Despite experiencing a considerable drop in popularity during the late 2010s as popular EDM shifted towards genres like Future Bass, brostep remains popular within its scene and is still a prominent element of the bass music sphere. Colour bass is a development of Brostep that combines its snarling midrange wobble with the euphoric drops of Melodic Dubstep and Future Bass. The resulting style features more lighthearted drops than traditional brostep where bright, aggressive basses and vibrant, energetic lead melodies fight for attention, sometimes accompanied by bloopy synths reminiscent of Chiptune. The repetitive synth work of Riddim is another common influence, crossing over into a related style known as \"melodic riddim\" or \"future riddim\" that would become a large part of the scene. The distinctive sound design of colour bass has also in more recent years been incorporated into other bass music genres like Dancefloor Drum and Bass and Trap [EDM]. Stylistically the genre's roots can be found earlier in the 2010s, with producers like 501 and Gemini who experimented with a similar combination of brostep and melodic dubstep. However, the term colour bass would not be coined until around 2016 when British producer Chime founded his Rushdown label that would eventually become the centre for the genre's burgeoning scene. Colour bass's popularity would grow in the wider EDM bass music scene by the end of the 2010s, with colour bass singles by producers like Trivecta and Xilent released on mainstream Electronic Dance Music label Monstercat. Rushdown would notably release the Colour Bass Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 compilations in 2020 that featured most of the genre's major players, including influential producers in the scene like Skybreak and Ace Aura. Deathstep is a subgenre of Brostep heavily influenced by Metal genres like Death Metal, Deathcore, Metalcore, and even Black Metal. The genre started out as a broad term for various styles of metal-inspired brostep, but has since become more of an established genre. The early deathstep sound contained more obvious metal influences: featuring heavy use of chopped up guitars, vocals such as screams and death growls, and also often included live drums (particularly for drum rolls). These elements were mixed with bass wobbles and half-time beats to create the effect of a \"breakdown\". Around the mid-2010s during brostep's decline in popularity, deathstep became much more of an established genre. The genre started to contain less obvious influences from metal but became darker and heavier than it was in its earlier days. The genre contains influence from various forms of Noise and Industrial music, and has also moved further away from the typical brostep sound, focusing less on accessibility. Many deathstep artists incorporate Riddim into their sound, particularly the genre's atonality, use of repetition to create a hypnotic effect, and off-kilter synths. One of the main elements of deathstep is the use of \"machine gun\" basses. These are heavy, rapid synths with a very short decay, usually in triplets. Another main characteristic is the heavy, atonal, almost white noise-sounding synths. Even though a handful of artists had already experimented with the deathstep sound prior to its release, the genre name was coined by Bratkilla with his album The Deathstep LP in 2011. This album became one of the main inspirations for many artists in the scene and helped shape the sound of the genre. Emerging as a stylistic shift in Dubstep in the early 2010s, chillstep is a derivation of the genre featuring more subdued and relaxed atmospheres largely borrowed from Downtempo. While it often retains dubstep's 140 BPM (though its often slower), halftime rhythms, and less commonly its sub-basses and \"wobbles\", chillstep trades dubstep's dark, melancholic and nocturnal sound for more polished and slick, calmer, and more serene atmospheres, often involving imagery of nature or pastoral sites, contrasting with dubstep's \"urban\" image. Chillstep was additionally influenced by Future Garage, another dubstep derivative that emphasized more subdued and ethereal atmospheres, and the two continued to cross-over and remain affiliated in the same scenes throughout the 2010s, often featuring side-by-side in the same labels, mixes, and producers' works. Some later developments in chillstep would stray away further from dubstep's sound, stripping down its percussion to minimalistic rhythms and even including prominent Ambient sections. Some styles of 2010s' Liquid Drum and Bass were also affiliated with chillstep, sharing the same scenes as it and future garage. A style of laid-back Hip Hop beats known as \"chill trap\" also had considerable cross-over with chillstep in certain scenes. Blackmill's early works were a major influence for early chillstep producers, having helped to establish and define the sound of the genre. Other early artists came from future garage scenes, notably Synkro and Phaeleh. The sound would later be further popularized by producers like Rameses B, CoMa, and EvenS, with YouTube mixes (especially those made for studying and relaxing) playing a particularly important role in its growth. Melodic Dubstep partially grew from chillstep (notably Blackmill's works were of great influence), and some producers would mix it with another 2010s-born dubstep derivative, Brostep. A specific form of Riddim known as \"liquid riddim\" appeared in the late 2010s. Chillstep would also be mixed with other 2010s-born Electronic Dance Music genres like Future Bass, Wave, and even Glitch Hop [EDM]. Melodic Dubstep is a subgenre of Electronic Dance Music that emerged during the early 2010s. As its name suggests, melodic dubstep evolved from scenes of early 2010s Dubstep trends not long after Brostep did, but ultimately became distinct from both dubstep and brostep due to a number of major stylistic differences. Like brostep and unlike 2000s dubstep, melodic dubstep implements buildup-drop structures that are more aimed at being emotional, intense, and bittersweet rather than groovy and atmospheric. Unlike brostep, melodic dubstep is based around melodious, tuneful drops, utilizing rich, lush synth leads, powerful stretched chords, as well as lighter and more harmonious sound design, different from the gritty and sometimes atonal leads typical in brostep. Melodic dubstep producers frequently feature singers (especially female singers) who usually deliver sentimental, passionate verses as to fit the drops. Melodic dubstep appeared around the same time as brostep and Chillstep, causing the genre to take influence from both of them and influence them too. Though it was and still is sometimes referred to as chillstep, melodic dubstep grew to be a separate genre, albeit with similar roots. It shares chillstep's relative accessibility compared to brostep and carries similar features from dubstep, such as a tempo of around 140 BPM, half-time beats and less often prominent sub-basses, but ultimately lacks chillstep's downtempo influence and relaxed, laid-back atmospheres. That being said, certain producers like Aether or Elliot Berger dabbled in both chillstep and melodic dubstep, similar to brostep producers like Au5 or Xilent who made both melodic dubstep and brostep. Fusions of the aforementioned genres remain relatively common today. Some of the genre's pioneers include producers who were initially known for producing brostep, like MitiS, Adventure Club or Nero, as well as chillstep producers like Blackmill and Azedia. Another early influence on melodic dubstep was Trance music (especially Uplifting Trance), as evident in the works of Seven Lions, who began as a trance producer, or MitiS. The genre played a significant role in the development of Future Bass, as producers who started as melodic dubstep producers such as Said the Sky, Illenium or T-Mass would later become popular for producing future bass. Future bass influences, like vocal chops, upbeat synth leads or 7th chords became more widespread in melodic dubstep in the latter half of the 2010s. The genre became popular partially thanks to promotional YouTube channels and labels like MrSuicideSheeep (along with Sheepy's label, Seeking Blue), NCS or Monstercat, who often featured and released melodic dubstep. Riddim, also known as wonky dubstep, is a subgenre of dubstep music that is characterized by its somewhat repetitive basslines and drums. This genre's roots can be traced back to 2010, with dubstep pioneer, Jakez, released Rhythm, widely considered to be the first ever true riddim song. The genre started to gain traction in the early-to-mid-2010s, with artists such as SUBFILTRONIK, INFEKT, Badphaze and many others being considered pioneers of the genre in its rawest form, with some notable highlights of the genre including \"Yasuo\" by Bommer & Crowell, \"Jotaro\" by Phiso and \"Passout\" by SUBFILTRONIK. The genre's popularity has remained fairly consistent through the 2010s and into the 2020s, with labels such as the now-defunct Never Say Die: Black Label, Savage Society Records and DPMO UK primarily focusing on riddim. Techno is a broad term initially applied to the Electronic Dance Music that originated in Detroit during the late 1980s (now referred to as Detroit Techno), a style heavily influenced by Electro, though now encompasses various subgenres from all over the globe. Generally speaking, techno music is beat-driven (typically in 4/4) and repetitive in nature, with minimal chord variation. It is aimed for the club environment, where numerous records can be mixed together throughout the night, though it has inspired more stripped-down styles such as Ambient Techno and Minimal Techno which are often better suited for home listening. Similarly, the rise of a multitude of Hardcore [EDM] scenes has pushed the genre to its limits and towards near-undanceable levels. Trance is an Electronic Dance Music genre defined by evolving, tension-building structures with rapid, minor arpeggios on top of a mechanical four-on-the-floor beat – altogether, evoking a euphoric and hypnotic state of \"trance\". It is also associated with drums from the TR-909 machine and a fast tempo in the range of 130-160 BPM. While the exact origins of trance aren't clear, they include Techno, EBM (particularly New Beat), and Acid House. Other genres were however attributed to inspiring the genre, such as Electro-Disco and Progressive Electronic. Despite properly emerging in the early 1990s in Germany, \" What Time Is Love? (Pure Trance 1)\" is sometimes considered the first trance track, followed by successful \"The Age of Love\". In the following years, trance would intensively develop into a broader umbrella of styles. The main initial form of trance emerged in the early 1990s from the forming techno scene in Berlin (originally centred around imported Detroit Techno). Masterminded For Success released genre-defining records, like Tranceformed From Beyond and releases by Paul van Dyk. The Frankfurt scene also played a big role, led by Sven Väth and Eye Q Records. In the UK, trance was developing alongside Progressive House, leading to the birth of Progressive Trance (one example of this is Underworld's euphoric \"Born Slippy\", used for the soundtrack of the Danny Boyle movie \"Trainspotting\"). Another pivotal country was Belgium with Bonzai Records known for its Hard Trance sound and later artists like Push. Lighter, House-influenced forms Dream Trance and Ibiza Trance contributed to the fast rise of the genre as well. At a similar time, Goa Trance developed in India, which would evolve into a broad, distinct, Psychedelia-inspired strain known as Psytrance, that would spawn various sub-sub genres of trance music, particularly in Israel. From the late 1990s, the Netherlands became key to further development and popularization of the genre, led by the trio of Ferry Corsten, Tiësto, and Armin van Buuren, who would become global stars, with Armada Music and Black Hole Recordings spawning over a hundred sub-labels dedicated to different styles. Uplifting Trance became the most prominent one, pioneering the use of supersaws and pronounced breakdowns and buildups, which would be influential on trance and EDM as a whole. Pop-oriented Euro-Trance and Vocal Trance continued trance's commercial success, while newly-emerging Tech Trance appealed to clubbers with a rawer and more complex sound. Throughout the 2000s, trance also started to pick up Electro House influences, which would later lead to the emergence of Big Room Trance and Festival Progressive House. The 2010s marked a decline in popularity, with so-called \"trouse\" and Big Room House replacing it at the forefront of mainstream EDM, as well as popularization of trance-influenced techno styles embracing its original qualities. Nevertheless, it established a vivid and broad scene with numerous artists, labels, festivals and podcasts (like the everlasting A State of Trance) still dedicated to the genre. Hard trance is a form of Trance music characterized by the incorporation of trance structures and atmospheres into faster rhythms within a more intense, rave-oriented nature, initially emerging from the first wave of trance music of the early 1990s among producers in Western Europe (mainly from the Benelux and German areas). The developments of hard trance became rooted within earlier existing forms of trance music, Acid Trance in particular, with minor influences of popular underground dance music subgenres like Breakbeat Hardcore, Techno and New Beat. Most producers that worked for the Bonzai Records label near Antwerp, Belgium majorly contributed to the hard trance sound. Hard trance of the 1990s commonly incorporates more thumping rhythms in contrast to earlier trance styles, often residing within a tempo range of 130-160 BPM, with melodic synth elements revolving around trance's lush pads and gated / plucked synths, 303 'acid' bass patterns and strong supersaw sections. Since the late 1990s this sound has moved to a more modern evolution, utilizing louder percussion and drawing in parallels to Tech Trance and Uplifting Trance, leading the genre to mimic both genres' structures whilst keeping its intense atmospheric traits. Since the mid-1990s hard trance saw a commercial crossover with broader club audiences from Europe, and has been declining in favor of other already-emerging styles. The influence of hard trance has been common in Hardcore [EDM] and emerging substyles from it, ranging from the heavier, Acid Techno-focused form of Acidcore, the lighter form of Happy Hardcore and other styles that have been fusing trance's melodic sections with hardcore's rhythmic sections, most notably Freeform Hardcore of the UK, and Dutch trancecore, which has been closely related to Netherlands' Gabber scene. Psytrance often takes cues of the original hard trance music scene including its acid bassline sections and focus on rhythm. In the United Kingdom, elements of hard trance became fused with UK Hard House's shuffling rhythms resulting in the wave of NRG. Contemporary forms of hard trance have been influencing other genres since, with Hands Up and Hardstyle being staples of the harder, modern trance-derived side of Electronic Dance Music. House music refers to a large, hugely popular group of related Electronic Dance Music styles, initially developing from Disco in the early 1980s. Each of its numerous subgenres, whilst incorporating a large variety of different sounds and influences, generally follow the template of drum machine-led 4/4 rhythms with a kick drum on each beat. These include the soulful, eclectic sounds of Deep House to the 'hoover' synth of UK Hard House to the relaxed, atmospheric feel of Ambient House to the low frequency buzzing bass of Electro House. Other common musical traits include heavy use of repetition, synthesized basslines, samplers, off-beat hi hats, snares and claps. The birthplace of house is credited to Chicago, the name thought to stem from 'The Warehouse' nightclub where pioneer Frankie Knuckles, often called 'The Godfather of House Music', frequently DJed. Here, the club-friendly Roland TR-808 and Roland TB-303-led sequenced synth and drum sounds of Chicago House and the 'squelchy', modulated bass of Acid House began to emerge. However, the New York Garage House sound was also developing at a similar time (pioneered by DJ Larry Levan at the 'Paradise Garage' nightclub), retaining more of its disco origins, making greater use of piano and adopting a smoother, soulful, more organic set of sounds and influences. 1986 saw house music hit the mainstream, with the success and influence of Chicago singles Move Your Body - House Music Anthem and Love Can't Turn Around. It soon spread to Detroit and the rest of the USA, Europe (Pump Up the Volume / Anitina (The First Time I See She Dance) reaching No. 1 in the UK charts in 1987) and other major cities around the world, creating a wide array of regional scenes, including Italo House, Balearic Beat and Latin House. Acid House exploded in popularity in the UK in 1988, with groups like 808 State and The Shamen dominating dancefloors. This soon morphed into the 'rave' scene and provided the soundtrack for the 'Second Summer of Love' (referring to both 1988 and 1989), which was heavily associated with recreational drugs. During the 1990s, house remained hugely successful internationally and productions constantly evolved with the times, frequently combining house with other giants of EDM, including Techno (Tech House), Trance (Progressive House) and Eurodance (Euro House), as well as the more retro disco and Funk-influenced French House. In the 2000s and 2010s, many more distinct variants developed, often sub-styles of deep house or electro house such as Fidget House, Outsider House, Big Room House and Tropical House. Since its inception, house music has had a big influence on Pop music, both by defining and influencing current popular trends (for example, the electro house-inspired huge wave of Electropop artists in the 2000s and beyond) and by providing the framework for music by hugely successful artists such as Madonna, Kylie Minogue, Pet Shop Boys and Daft Punk. Nightcore is a genre of Electronic music that began in the early 2000s associated with the Animecore aesthetic. The genre's origins can be traced back to the works of Thomas S. Nilse and Steffen Ojala Søderholm in their titular collaborative project Nightcore. These works, as well as all works in the genre, are based around the speeding up of already existing songs, increasing the BPM to be usually near 200. The genre is characterized by high-pitched vocals and a generally cutesy tone. These songs are often produced in free, easy to use programs such as Audacity, and are often uploaded to YouTube, SoundCloud and (earlier in nightcore's history) LimeWire. Generally, these songs are used without the consent of the remixed artists. Releases typically take from Eurodance and Vocal Trance, but more recent releases have taken a broader approach to production, often remixing Alternative Rock, Contemporary R&B, and Indie Folk while using the same blanket term of \"nightcore\". Visuals of anime characters and fantasy landscapes are often associated with the genre. It is not uncommon for nightcore DJs to slightly modify the tracks being remixed, such as adding in additional breaks or producing the track beyond the process of simply speeding it up. Since the start of the 2010s, the style has begun to greatly grow in popularity. This is reflected by the rise of many nightcore labels such as Manicure Records and DJs such as Jack that specialize in creating and showcasing nightcore for a wider audience. Nightcore has been a direct influence of several musicians, including Lido, Ryan Hemsworth and many producers affiliated with the PC Music label. The Madchester scene has inspired numerous movies, chief among them being 24 Hour Party People (2002) and Trainspotting (1996). Also, Human Traffic (1999) is another notable raver movie. The Matrix trilogy, mainly the first three movies, also contains a few rave scenes. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

Realists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding in the contemporaneous naturalist literature of Émile Zola, Honoré de Balzac, and Gustave Flaubert. After the movement's origin in France, realism spread to artists in other locations and time periods. For example, Peredvizhniki refers to the Russian realist artists in the 1860s-1880s. In addition to the art movement, Realism also refers to technique of painting a precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects. Realism in this sense is also called naturalism, mimesis or illusionism.

Technically the term Regency refers to a time period in British history, but it is commonly applied to the same time period in other countries, such as France, Russia, and the United States, because of the wide reach of the aesthetic. In the US, this time period is sometimes referred to as the Federalist Era. This aesthetic gained notoriety largely because of Jane Austen, a female author who wrote romance novels that became incredibly popular during her time and up to the present day. Many television shows, movies, and books adapted and riffed on her work, making this historical period widely known to many audiences. The large part of the appeal of her works is a look into the lives of British nobility of the time period, which, for women, involved elaborate courtship rituals, fashionable gowns, and webs of interpersonal relationships surrounding wealth and power. Because of the influx of famous retellings in around 2020, especially with Emma (2020) and Bridgerton (2020), many young women looked to the fashion as inspiration, with Regency-era fashion details such as puffed sleeves and empire waists being fancifully re-imagined with modern colors and fabrics.[1] The fashion and artistic design of the Regency era was heavily influenced by archeological finds. Ancient Greek clothing influenced women's fashion and design motifs from pottery and furniture were copied. The Regency aesthetic experienced a revival in the early 1900s due to Kate Greenaway's illustrations in children's books, and much later in 2021 with the release of the Bridgerton Netflix series. Regency visuals are often focused on elegance and grace. Traditional regency dresses are characterized by loose, gauzy skirts and an empire silhouette. They normally tend to be in pastels. Accessories include gloves, necklaces, bonnets, shawls/wraps, headpieces, parasols, and fans. Brands Men's fashion included top hats, cravats, shirts with high collars, waistcoats, frock coats, tight fitting breeches, and riding boots. Zack Pinset is a rare example of a man who exclusively wears Regency men's fashion. Brands The Regency era is a popular setting for historical romance novels.",

The creator, Tumblr user clive-gershwin-palmer, invented the trend in January 2015, in a post that has now been deleted.[1] The trend was relatively dormant until March 2015, when Tumblr user korvidian created a post entitled \"south-east queensland gothic\"[2] that created the template for all future Regional Gothic lists here on after. Despite its origin from the Tumblr community, the aesthetic is a continuation of the Gothic literary genre, with multiple authors such as H.P. Lovecraft and William Faulkner combining horror with their local culture and history. The largest influence appears to have come from the podcast Welcome to Night Vale, where a radio host describes eerie events in their paranormal and unusual town with the same diction as the later Tumblr posts. Regional Gothic visuals include photography of towns or townspeople with eerie overlays/weather. Imagery of houses, neighborhoods, streets, apartments, and farms are common motifs of this aesthetic. Photos inside houses, schools, and similar buildings are also common. However, cities and more developed, populated areas are less common to see in this aesthetic, if not included at all. Regional gothic emphasizes architecture and people as a collective. Regional gothic fashion is typically conservative and traditional - consistent with one's hometown, so this can vary. Southern Gothic is a literary genre encompassing fashion inspired by the culture of the American South. It originated in works by 19th-20th century Southern authors criticizing their society's racism, sexism, classism, fixation on the past, and decaying economy. Later the aesthetic deviated from literature with the \"regional gothic\" trend on tumblr in the mid-2010s, which places greater emphasis on Liminal Space, modern American iconography, evangelicalism, and controversially, hillbilly horror. Suburban Gothic is an aesthetic based around feelings of alienation and the uncanny, usually represented in being alone in suburban neighborhoods. Common motifs include coming-of-age, familial/generational trauma, facades, and the shallowness of capitalistic culture. The motifs and photographs are American-centric, with parodies and dark interpretations of the 1950s nuclear family and 1980s economic boom. Those characters and locations tend to have a dark secret, such as drug addiction or infidelity, to emphasize the darker nature of the restrictiveness of social norms. Music is not a major part of this aesthetic, but songs and playlists for Regional Gothic exist.",

Renewable Corporate Utopia promoted environmental positivity during a time when global warming was (and still is) a great issue. It combines the utopic, humanist, naturist themes of Frutiger Eco with Corporate office based imagery and values. The best way to describe this would essentially just be Frutiger Eco if you took out the “Frutiger”. RCU came to prominence in the early-2010s and lost popularity in the late-2010s with the rise of Corporate Memphis. Renewable Corporate Utopia came to prominence around the early-2010s around the downfall of Frutiger Aero and the rise of Post-Morphism. It aimed to combine the Corporate Workplace aesthetic with the simultaneously eco-friendly and utopian Frutiger Eco. This was a product of the environmentalist themes of the era triggered by global warming and climate change fears, similar to Frutiger Eco's background. RCU was used prominently among many companies throughout the 2010s, but slowly started dying down in favor of the rising popularity of Corporate Memphis around the late-2010s/early-2020s. Although not used as commonly in advertising, many RCU images are still prominent today in media such as school textbooks and corporate marketing as it is a simple but effective way of displaying an eco-utopic future with consumer-friendly values that make it optimistic and timeless. Renewable Corporate Utopia combines the utopic, humanist, and naturist themes of Frutiger Eco with Corporate office based imagery and values. People featured in RCU images tend to display neatness, presentability, and looking \"sharp\". Related fonts are typically rounded and with a lot of negative space. Some examples include Avenue, Futura, Century, Gothic, Raleway, Nunito, Quicksand, Cumulus, Caviar-Dreams, etc.. Prominent colors featured in RCU include: dale & deep green, white, baby blue & blue, cyan, turquoise, teal, pale yellow, light orange and grey. Architecturally, RCU emphasizes clean, open office spaces, windows, elevated spaces, bright lighting, and greenery, with greenwall a particularly common trope. Imagery is of the typical faceless, emotionless corporate pablu typem, but with an environmental bent: Renewable Corporate Utopia has a heavy focus on Corporate imagery and themes, largely omitting the glossy, abstract flourishes or themes of Frutiger Aero. Despite this, RCU still retains the naturistic, iconographic, humanistic and 3D render motifs of Frutiger Eco. Much like Bright Tertiaries, RCU also leans toward company architecture, industrial iconography, geometry, vector graphics, holographics, minimalism, and often even the use of empty semi-liminal space, Overall, RCU heavily emphasises the corporate side of Frutiger Eco, while omitting the abstract dreamlike imagery characteristic of Frutiger Aero.",

If futurism is sometimes called a \"science\" bent on anticipating[1] what will come, retrofuturism is the remembering of that anticipation. Characterized by a blend of old-fashioned \"retro styles\" with futuristic technology, retrofuturism explores the themes of tension between past and future, and between the alienating and empowering effects of technology. Retro-Futurism is also a pretty broad term that can refer to any futuristic aesthetic that no longer aligns with the current general  expectatives of the future by society. Therefore, Retro-Futurism is separated into several genres by the era of technology they were based on. The primary ones are Steampunk, Dieselpunk, Atompunk, Raygun Gothic and Cyberpunk, and possibly even Y2K Futurism. Retrofuturism has visual elements similar to vintage - older artwork and photos that tried to predict the future. Themes of space, robots, and minimalism are common themes of this aesthetic. Retrofuturism is the product of artists attempting to visualize the future with the viewpoint of a non-futuristic century. Retrofuturistic fashion includes simplistic clothing that incorporates futuristic technology/inventions. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

This aesthetic is characterized by its depiction of graphic and explicit scenes involving stick figures, often showing blood, dismemberment, or other forms of extreme violence, as well as Grotesque imagery.   The aesthetic became a meme in 2021 when various Instagram and Tumblr users started making memes out of these gory illustrations, starting a meme format called \"Stick Figure Violence\" according to KnowYourMeme[1]. Revcore also gained a fanbase on the 4chan forums, especially when it started being used on some offensive memes.   The aesthetic itself rose up in 2021, but it is inspired by older \"brutalist\" meme templates from the 2010s. The exact origin of the term \"ревcore\" is not known, but it is thought to come from the name of a Roblox shirt named \"рев\"[2] which translates to \"roar\" in Bulgarian (possibly describing the violent nature of the aesthetic). The visuals of Revcore typically involve stickmen fighting each other in macabre ways, and gory imagery including blood, blood splatters, and even organs in some more disturbing examples of the aesthetic. The aesthetic is also known for mimicking older meme formats, like ragecomics. Because of this, Revcore memes often involve pixelated or compressed imagery. The general appeal of Revcore mainly comes from its disturbingly macabre yet \"unoffensive\" nature, because the characters depicted in the memes are just stickmen rather than actual people.",

It was often performed by all-female groups, and was lyrically focused on female empowerment and tackling controversial issues such as domestic violence, discrimination and rape. Musically, riot grrrl typically featured the customary Rock instrumentation of electric guitar, bass guitar and drums, whilst the style was rooted in Punk Rock and took cues from Grunge, Post-Hardcore and Noise Rock. Trademarks include shouted female vocals which are usually chaotic, sneering and confrontational; loose, abrasive distorted guitar; and short, concise track times and song structures. The subsequent sound produced is raw, strident, aggressive, perfunctory, and often ramshackle or disjointed. Many were often not considered part of the wider political movement and were seen as adjacent to the movement, such as Grunge acts Babes in Toyland, 7 Year Bitch, and L7. Likewise there are quite a few groups that are also part of the Queercore scene. The term Riot Grrrl stems from Allison Wolfe and Molly Neuman, members of the feminist punk band Bratmobile, who coined the phrase “girl riot.” Jen Smith then created the term “grrrl” and later “Riot Grrrl” through the expression “angry grrrl zines” devised by Tobi Vail.. Early participants deliberately used “grrrl” instead of “girl” to remove the passive association with the word “girl” as well as to display the anger behind the movement, reminiscent of a growl. On August 20, 1991, in Olympia, Washington, members of Bikini Kill and Bratmobile, along with 15 other all-girl or female-fronted bands, took the stage at an event called \"Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now\" or simply, \"Girl Night.\" Girl Night was the kickoff show of the International Pop Underground Convention (IPU), a five-day gathering of D.I.Y. scenesters organized by K Records' Calvin Johnson and Candice Pederson. The IPU established K Records and the Kill Rock Stars label (launched by an eponymous compilation sold at the convention) as hubs of one camp in a factionalizing indie rock scene. They intended to embrace creativity over commerce — and invite everyone to the party. Riot Grrrl is not a fashion term or usage. Kinderwhore fashion was used by both Hole's Courtney Love and Kat Bjelland from Babes in Toyland. Although Riot Grrrl emerged in Washington, D.C., it became mostly popular in Washington, specifically Olympia through the use of “zines,” which are short for “fanzines.” Zines are homemade publications with limited circulation. Zines became an important part of the punk scene in the early 1970s because it was a way to produce a publication “unhampered by corporate structure”. However, zines served as a place to discuss issues that were considered taboo in mainstream culture such as rape, incest, and eating disorders. Zines allowed women to form connections with other women that shared similar ideas and experiences and ultimately created a community. In Washington D.C., some of the band members from Bikini Kill and Bratmobile, held weekly meetings for women to attend, express their frustrations, and show support for one another. Approximately two years after the introduction of Riot Grrrl zines, a small Riot Grrrl network formed which spread to New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Richmond. These were groups of high school to college aged girl that met often to discuss ideas, plan Riot Grrrl festivals, and support each other’s music. Musically, Riot Grrrl sometimes fit right alongside their male counterparts in the Grunge scene, taking the world by storm in the 1990s. However most were never included in the Grunge scene and were far more punk based. Hole is not considered Riot Grrrl as they never embraced the community feminist aspect of that scene. Some popular bands and artists include: The Punk Singer is a 2013 documentary film about feminist singer Kathleen Hanna who fronted the bands Bikini Kill and Le Tigre, and who was a central figure in the riot grrrl movement. Using a combination of interviews and archival footage including live band performances, the film traces the life and career of Hanna from her troubled upbringing and her start in spoken word performance poetry, through her riot grrrl zines, her prominent punk and dance-punk bands, her coining of the phrase \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" for Kurt Cobain, her solo career as Julie Ruin, her feminist activism, her marriage to Beastie Boys member Adam Horovitz, and ending with Hanna's 2010 diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease and the severe treatments she endures to combat it.

The name is a combination of \"rock\" and \"hillbilly\", the latter being an old term for country music. Thus, the aesthetic is usually used to refer to 1950s fashion and general style, as well as country music aesthetics. Nowadays, the term describes the subculture of people who want to live a lifestyle and/or wear the fashion themed after the original rock fans of the 1950s. Many of the motifs are exaggerated, with the visual clichés applied to aspects of modern life, such as modern fridges designed to look vintage. Many people also gravitate towards this aesthetic not only because of the music; vintage car, pin-up, and pop culture enthusiasts often come into this community during the modern day. Rockabilly fashion is one of the most interesting because it works with bold, rich colors and old-school style. Although it's not that common to see women wearing this style in the streets nowadays, the Rockabilly genre and its style is making a small comeback thanks to the ever-changing music scene and the growing trend of modernized 50's and 60's fashion. There are many options when it comes to choosing tops for the outfit, from tank tops to crop tops to high-tie button-down blouses and more. Stripes and polka dots are the preferred patterns, along with solid colors. Red, white, and black are the base colors to choose. Pencil skirts and cuffed denim pants are very common lower wear. Polka dot dresses are a staple in Rockabilly fashion and they are given a lot of importance. They're always loud and eye-catching, even if they're not brightly colored. Most Rockabilly dresses are form fitting, hitting just below the knee, but there are always variations, many being ruffled and slightly voluminous. There are many styles of shoes with heels, a height of 7.5-10cm being the most common. Alternatively, there's also ballet flats, saddle shoes, converse, and creepers. Black seems to be the hair color of choice when it comes to Rockabilly style and most common. Since most people aren't born with natural jet-black hair, it's usually dyed. One thing to keep in mind is that most hairstyles for women have curled parts, are pinned up, and often include hair accessories like flowers or small bows. Various deep shades of red are used for the lips, along with winged eyeliner and mascara. Blush is applied to the apple of the cheeks to give a rosy hue and sometimes fake beauty marks are added. There are a handful of styles that are similar or derived from Rockabilly. In fact, it's not uncommon for them to be confused or considered the same style, as there is usually little to almost no discernible differences.

Wiktionary generally defines \"rocketpunk\" as \"a subgenre of speculative fiction based on space exploration.\"[1] As quoted by Winchell Chung's Atomic Rockets website, Rick Robinson of the Rocketpunk Manifesto blog specifically defines the term as retro-futuristic visions of space travel from the 1950s: advanced and cheap aerospace technology with primitive electronics.[2] The term \"NASApunk\" has been used by the developers of the video game Starfield to refer to an aesthetic inspired by real-life space programs like NASA (but not necessarily hard sci-fi).[3] The aesthetic of realistic cylindrical and conical space warships has sometimes been jokingly referred to as \"COADEcore\" on the ToughSF Discord server,[4] in reference to the video game Children of a Dead Earth. Rocketpunk is based on the \"Space Age\" which began in the 1950s, especially with the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik in 1957. Prototypical examples include 19th century science fiction like Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon, as well as 1920s-1940s media like Buck Rogers. Shortly after World War II, rockets in science fiction came to resemble the infamous German V-2 missile.[5] Traditionally, Rocketpunk can appear like 1950s-1960s pulp sci-fi illustrations associated with Atompunk and Raygun Gothic, including the social conventions of the time. More modern and realistic (hard) sci-fi tends to be inspired by real-life space programs or proposals, such as NASA's Apollo Moon missions, the unbuilt Project Orion nuclear spacecraft, or the International Space Station. A larger human presence in space may be depicted in the form of interplanetary spacecraft and space colonies. The tone can range from optimistic (but not without challenges) to dystopian.

It began as a reaction against the Baroque grandeur of Louis XIV's court at the Palace of Versailles. In some ways, it was in contradiction with the Baroque (by using pastel colours, light-hearted subjects in painting and sculpture, and asummetry in design), but it was also a continuation (by using motifs and rules taken from Greco-Roman antiquity in exterior architecture, many surfaces covered in gold leaf, and the overall bourgeois or noble vibe). The movement started as an ornamental, elegant interior design style, and was characterized by curvy shapes. Architecture followed and then painting and sculpture. The Rococo style developed in France in the first half of the eighteenth century. The king of France, Louis XV is often thought to be a key patron and supporter of the movement-- a very likely hypothesis considering the monarch's need to differentiate himself from the king who proceeded him: Louis XIV (a key patron of the Baroque style). Rococo styling brought about a new wave of romanticism; the new idea of finding a soulmate, someone whom you love, as opposed to the arranged marriages common in the past. Rococo architecture is fancy and fluid, accentuating asymmetry, with an abundant use of curves, scrolls, gilding and ornaments. The style enjoyed great popularity with the ruling elite of Europe during the first half of the 18th century. It developed in France out of a new fashion in interior decoration, and spread across Europe. While few Rococo exteriors were built in France, a number of Rococo churches are found in southern Germany. Domestic Rococo abandoned Baroque's high moral tone and seriousness: in fact, its abstract forms and carefree, pastoral subjects related more to refuge and joy that created a more forgiving atmosphere for polite conversations. Rococo rooms are typically smaller than the Baroque ones, reflecting a movement towards domestic intimacy. Even the grander salons used for entertaining were more modest in scale, as social events involved smaller numbers of guests. Characteristic of the style were Rocaille motifs derived from the shells, icicles and rock-work or grotto decoration. Foliage was also widely used for decoration, under the form of acanthus leaves, garlands (aka festoons), many flowers, and bouquets of flowers. Rococo foliage was always twisting and sinuous, with the common serrated-edged raffle leaf form often bordering the abstract. Other widely-user motifs in decorative arts and interior architecture include: birds, elements associated with love (putti, quivers with arrows ans arrowed hearts) trophies of arms, cherubs (aka putti), medallions with faces, and sometimes Far Eastern elements (pagodes, dragons, monkeys, bizarre flowers, bamboo, and Chinese people). Asymmetry is present in architecture and applied arts, making buildings and ornaments look more dynamic. Pastel colours were widely used, like light blue, mint green or pink. Designers also loved mirrors (the more the better), an example being the Hall of Mirrors of the Amalienburg (Munich, Germany), by Johann Baptist Zimmermann. Generally, mirrors are also featured above fireplaces. Sometimes, Chinese black and glossy lacquer panels were used for decorating rooms in Rococo palaces, used as wall panels. Due to its aspect, black lacquer was popular for Western men's studies. Similarly with the case of architecture, Rococo paintings and sculptures are characterized by elegantly flowing shapes and pastel colours. They often show romantic subjects, moments of aristocratic life, and scenes of Greco-Roman mythology. With his sensuous paintings, François Boucher was one of the most acclaimed Rococo painters, but the most significant was Jean-Antoine Watteau, with his 'fête galante' outdoor scenes. Paintings of this type were also popular in England and Italy. Besides canvases, impressive frescos were produced in this style as well. In present-day Germany, multiple palaces and churches have painted ceilings, featuring complex scenes. They were influenced by the works of 17th century Baroque painted Andrea Pozzo, who made illusionistic ceiling paintings. These painted ceilings evoke joy and triumph. Rococo sculptures feature elegantly flowing shapes, just like how paintings do. Sculptures of cherubs (aka putti), are often used for decorating buildings, both secular and religious. Some marble sculptures had also porcelain reproductions, like the Seated Cupid by Étienne-Maurice Falconet. Reliefs of human faces (aka mascarons) are sometimes used for decorating keystones at the top of windows or doors, especially in French architecture. Most of the characteristics of architecture, like asymmetry or the wide use of foliage decoration, are also present in Rococo design. S and C-shaped volutes appear everywhere, from furniture to porcelain. The most widely used materials are oak, beech, walnut, gilt bronze and brass, grey, pink, red, green, orange or blue marble; velvets, fabrics, and silks in light colours. Sometimes, Chinese black and glossy lacquer panels were used for making furniture. In some cases, rectangular or medallion-shaped painted Sèvres porcelain plaques were used for decorating. However, in most cases wood was inlayed and designs of flowers, trophies, characters, or just geometric shapes decorated furniture. Different types of wood were used for achieving different colours. Gilded wood is used less than in the Baroque period, being reserved for mirror frames, console tables and some archairs. Bronze fittings were often gilded using mercury (ormolu). Most of the Rococo chairs have their framework painted in light colours, like white. Their upholstery is decorated, either with foliage or pastoral scenes. Desks and commodes were usually decorated with gilt bronze mounts, and had marble tops, usually white or grey. Delicate Rococo porcelain figures and vases were produced during the 18th century. They are often coloured and glossy, but also sometimes completely white and biscuit porcelain. Some marble sculptures had also porcelain reproductions, like the Seated Cupid by Étienne-Maurice Falconet, and some porcelain figures were made after paintings. The most famous manufactories were at Meissen (near Dresden) in Germany, and Sèvres in France. Porcelain was developed in China in the 9th century. Its recipe was kept secret from other nations, and only successfully copied in the 15th century by the Japanese and Vietnamese. During the 18th century, European kilns finally figured out how to make porcelain, beginning with the alchemist Johann Friedrich Böttger and the physicist Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhausen, who made the first European variety in 1709. Later, other kilns stole the recipe or came up with their own porcelain technology. Rococo fashion was based on extravagance, elegance, refinement and decoration. Chinoiserie was a Western decorative style of Orientalism popular during the 18th century that was heavily inspired by Chinese arts. It blended well with Rococo and both aesthetics synergized in a movement known as Rococo Chinoiserie.[1] Nobles and kings built little structures inspired by these styles in the gardens of their palaces. They fully decorated a handful of rooms of palaces, with Chinese lacquer panels used as wall panels. Due to its aspect, black lacquer was popular for Western men's studies. Those panels used in chinoiserie were usually glossy and black, made in the Henan province of China. They were made of multiple layers of lacquer, then incised with motifs in-filled with colour and gold. Chinese, but also Japanese lacquer panels were also used by some 18th century European carpenters for making furniture. Lacquered furniture was admired for its impermeability and for its lustrous beauty. In order to be produced, Asian screens were dismantled and used to veneer European-made furniture. The vogue for East Asian objects was not limited only lacquer. Porcelain brought from the east was very popular, both as vases and figures. Porcelain collections were often displayed on the walls of certain rooms, usually each vase or figurine having a bracket under it. In some cases, Chinese or Japanese ceramics were decorated by Europeans with gilt bronze mounts. Chinoiserie objects and architecture were also produced during the 19th century, but without the Rococo twist like they were in the 18th century. Chinoiserie also sometimes extended to music, an example of this being the 1931 song 'The Yodelling Chinaman' by George van Dusen. Music in Western genres but with an East Asian twist is also produced in recent times, such is the case of 'Song 2' from 2004 by DJ Krush. Due to its association with an increasingly irrelevant aristocracy, the Rococo was replaced during the mid-18th century by Neoclassicism, a movement that heavily takes its inspiration from and tries to revive the art of Ancient Greece and Rome. Most writings place the end of the Rococo in the mid-18th century, however, impressive Rococo art was also produced during the 1760s and 1770s, and artists like Josef Anton Mesmer were painting illusionistic ceilings in rural Switzerland as late as 1815. Some of the most important figures of the movement flourished long after the style's purported death. In more remote areas of Latin America, where non-white artists who were kept out of the metropolitan academies found patrons among Amerindians, Baroque and Rococo churches were still being built in the 1850s. The transition from Rococo to Neoclassicism wasn't very abrupt. Some of the biggest patrons of Rococo art also commissioned early Neoclassical works. Madame de Pompadour, one of the main figures of Rococo, commissioned the Petit Trianon, one of the most important examples of French Neoclassical architecture. Similarly, Louis XV, the king at whose court the Rococo flourished, founded the Panthéon, another iconic Neoclassical monument. Besides this, in France there was the Louis XVI style, which uses shapes and motifs taken from ancient Greek, Etruscan and Roman antiquity, but still has the sweet, delicate and fancy vibe of the Rococo. In the UK, Robert Adam's Greco-Roman inspired interior of the Eating Room in the Osterley Park, near London, despite being Neoclassical, is painted mainly in white and pastel green and pink, reminiscent of Rococo. It must be mentioned that Neoclassicism wasn't about copying. Artists didn't try to become frozen in the past, but to use Antiquity and its ideals in a way that was relevant to contemporary society. Similarly with other styles, like the Gothic or the Baroque, there was a revival of the rococo during the 19th century. This 19th century revival was popular particularly in France, due to the fact that this is the country where the style appeared in the 18th century. Neo-Rococo buildings, furniture, paintings, tableware, mantel clocks and other objects were created during the 19th and the early 20th centuries. Between the 1830s and the 1860s, Jacob Petit produced porcelain inspired by the curvy lines and shapes of rococo, some of which are exhibited in the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris. After WW1, styles of the past were seen as \"dated\" or \"passé\", including the rococo. The complex ornaments of these movements were replaced by geometric shapes and abstracted motifs, or just simple blank surfaces, in Art Deco, Bauhaus and mid-century design. Later, during the late 2000s, the 2010s and the 2020, due to the interest for vintage stuff and the appreciation of young generation for styles of the past, new Rococo objects were and are produced. This present-day revival was particularly popular in frames and porcelain, since most frames and tableware that try to look \"vintage\" or \"old\" are in this style. Some music videos or high-fashion outfits also make references to the style. The best example of this is Katy Perry's 2018 song and music video Hey Hey Hey.",

The name is a reference to the 1975 James Caan film Rollerball, and like the film, the aesthetic often delves into 1970s retrofuturism, however, unlike standard Retro-Futurism or Atompunk, Rollerwave deals only with the 70s, and has a far less Jetson-y feel. Common themes include oil crises, growing tension in the Middle East, everyday 1970s life, LaserDisc, household appliances, early computing, RadioShack, the NBC Peacock logo, and post-countercultural disillusionment. Unlike Psychedelica and Pop Art, Rollerwave is less experimental or even thought-provoking- and is less flashy than Future Funk. However, due to Rollerwave's technological emphasis, it could be seen as the everyday equivalent of Future Funk- the daytime business casual activities to clash with Future Funk's breezy whirlwind nightlife.  Much like Vaporwave and Synthwave, Rollerwave can feature mall, video game, and arcade aesthetics, but with more of a 70s flair (so less NES and more Atari 2600, Pinball, or Pong, and more urban department store/Kmart than standard shopping malls) as opposed to the 80s and 90s often associated with the prior aesthetics. Visually, the Rollerwave aesthetic can draw from the comedies of the era, such as Network, Fun With Dick And Jane, or Car Wash- though mainstream social critique in the 1970s was notoriously scant. Rollerwave is indicative of a future where the Cold War never ended, computers still feature cold dark screens with robotic green text, and mundane tan office buildings are ever-present. Like Vaporwave, Rollerwave can serve as a deconstruction and critique of capitalism and a reflection on nostalgia- however, unlike Grindhouse, Rollerwave takes a purely utopian approach, with a hint of societal issues and ominous tones thrown in. It does not concern itself with the lower classes of society, going instead for a privileged middle-class vibe, usually urban. Like the setting of Rollerball, Rollerwave is a futuristic projection of the 1970s where society does not advance in style or attitude past the 1970s, but makes substantial leaps ahead in technology, and the wanton economic corruption of the decade gives way to systemic injustice. Rollerwave fashion is reflective of the popular fashions of the 1970s, but only the mundane, everyday fashions- the sort of thing one would find in a Montgomery Ward or Woolworth's, or Gary Collins's closet. Sideburns are common, as are sports jackets and knee-high skirts. Above all else, Rollerwave fashion is not at all provocative or challenging to the mainstream. The first modern Rollerwave album, \"To Every Man,\" created by a musician going by the name of Dan Frost in 2017, was unknown until he went public in June 2021 after the album cover's leak. Frost describes the term \"Rollerwave,\" which he coined, as an ironic response to Vaporwave. The full album was released on July 1, 2021 on Dan Frost's YouTube channel. Earlier music that could be termed Rollerwave music can generally be attributed to the Scottish electronic music group Boards Of Canada, whose music is undeniably 70s, making use of analog reel-to-reel machines and keyboards, however some aspects of Daft Punk's music, in particular the music video for Technologik or the theme and tone of Random Access Memories, are reminiscent of the 70s. This makes sense, considering that according to the 20-30-year-cycle nostalgia for the 70s would crop up in the 90s and 2000s. While Rollerwave music is usually electronic in nature, sampling 70s electronic groups such as Kraftwerk or Giorgio Moroder, soft easy-listening pieces and adult contemporary music from the 70s can also apply, or be sampled to create new pieces. (Think Meatloaf, Jim Croce or Billy Joel during his Stranger period.) Also Muzak. The latter pieces are considered \"soft\" while electronica-centric remixes can be deemed \"hard\" rollerwave. While Boards of Canada are undoubtedly the progenitors of the early Rollerwave scene, several bands which preceded them could be considered Rollerwave listening. Modern Rollerwave, unlike the catalog of BoC, relies more heavily on samples than original synth scores, and utilizes all the auditory techniques of vaporwave (i.e. chopping, splicing, looping, and reverb). Rollerwave music typically samples American 70s folk songs, PSAs, cartoons of the era, and Prog Rock, and implements rock organs, Moog synths, and drum machines, all played back on cassette or 8-track. Some notable bands which reflect the gist of Rollerwave music include: Rollerwave activities can include:",

Romantic Academia is visually and philosophically similar to Light Academia. However, Romantic Academia includes more visuals associated with romantic love, which is not the primary focus of light academia. Philosophically, both aesthetics value education, curiosity, compassion, and optimism, but Romantic Academia differs from Light Academia in its focus on individualism, appreciation of nature, and aesthetic expression of intense and sometimes negative emotions. Like both Dark and Light Academia, Romantic Academia relies heavily on visuals, philosophy, and literature with origins in Western Europe. Many romantic academia visuals are taken from 90s and early 2000s Shakespeare and Jane Austen adaptions, which tended towards a romantic, poetic aesthetic. (Kenneth Branagh is a particularly important director in this regard.) The Smiths and the earlier work of Morrissey can be considered the ultimate epitome of Light, Dark, and Romantic Academia aesthetic in their music videos (romance, books, melancholy, flowers, poet sleeves, candles, autumn, forests, romanticizing rural and industrialized areas, etc.) The videos for “This Charming Man” and “The Boy With the Thorn in His Side” are especially important. Other more dream pop-oriented bands like Felt, Dif Juz, The Dream Academy, Virginia Astley, Shelleyan Orphan, The Ocean Blue, and even This Mortal Coil and Cocteau Twins (although they are more Ethereal Goth and Strega) featured videos and imagery in this vein. Romantic Academia combines the love of learning and literature with the values of Romanticism, including individuality, emotion, celebration of beauty and nature, and rejection of social convention. It is also partially influenced by the values of Dark and Light Academia. One of the other most important themes is that of exploration, the urge to discover. These ideas stem from the romantic appreciation of nature and the academic goal of studying, although it dispels the idea of studying as an immobile task. This aesthetic defines studying and learning as something that can be witnessed firsthand, not just from documents but also from the application in the real world. There is no specific genre, but there is certainly a heavy influence from the softer side of post-punk, baroque pop, dream pop, and shoegaze. (Sometimes even Synthpop.)",

Romantic Goth embraces a dark LARP-influenced fashion, and is distinctly different from the other softer types of Goth culture (particularly Woodland Goth). It was and is mostly defined by the fashion and the musical genre, which often hybridizes with smaller sub-styles like Vampire, Fairy Goth, and Victorian Goth. It’s also closely related to Gothic literature and art’s influence on Goth music and imagery. Romantic Goth is seen as a relatively lighter, happier form of Goth, with an emphasis on romance and expressing themselves through art, in contrast to more vampire and Victorian leaning variants of the style. Romantic Goth was born out of the 90s neoclassical darkwave and dark ambient scenes, particularly the medieval/victorian dress and Celtic vocals displayed by bands like Requiem in White and Miranda Sex Garden. During 90s Romantic Goth style sometimes became mainstream fashion.[1] Unlike Mallgoth style, this style was worn by adult women outside of subcultures. Despite it wasn't mainstream anymore, in 00s Romantic Goth peaked in popularity[2] to the point many people started to think this is a Trad Goth style.[3] According to the Goth Types Wiki, here are some visual aspects to Romantic Goth: Fashion under Romantic Goth may include: Popular hairstyles under this aesthetic can contain: Romantic Goths usually tend to listen to neoclassical darkwave, dark cabaret, or operatic influenced ethereal wave with a brooding or passionate mood.

The movement developed in reaction against the rationalism of the Enlightenment, and later on, against the materialism of the Industrial Revolution. Romanticism, at its heart, values: nature, emotionality, subjectivity, and individuality. But above all, the Romantic strives towards the enigmatic ideal of the \"sublime\". Because Romanticism is so idealistic, it often aligns itself with Nationalism which is why the traits and visual tropes of Romanticism vary from country to country. However, this fascination with national ideals often resulted in a Romantic fertilization of non-western/European societies and cultures. Nineteenth century Romantics generally wore their hair longer than the squares of the day, and would have probably worn more typically androgynous clothing. Their wardrobe consisted of silk scarves, looser jackets and pantaloons, straw hats, and a walking stick—seeing as the Romantic loves to hike and walk through nature. However, the Romantic ideal of the young genius resulted in a trend towards looking sickly. Romantics often wanted to look consumptive—that is to say flushed and thin—and worshipped the premature deaths of Romantic poet John Keats (who died at the age of 25) and composer Frederic Chopin (who was 39), both of tuberculosis. The Key Texts of Romanticism: Early Romantic Texts Second Generation Romantic Texts Russian Romantic Texts French Romantic Texts Polish Romantic Texts The cumulative Romantic musical form is the symphony—a form of music dependent on subjective experience and emotions. Romantic Composers Dark Romanticism is a subgenre of Romanticism,\n reflecting popular fascination with the irrational, the demonic and the\n grotesque. It is characterized by the fact that it particularly \nemphasizes irrational, melancholic features and is also fascinated by \nthe design of human madness and by Evil. Often conflated with Gothicism,\n it has shadowed the euphoric Romantic movement ever since its \n18th-century beginnings.

Royalcore revolves around refinement and classic western standards of behavior. Intelligence, morality, skill, and elegance are base qualities that give more meaning to the look. Visually, this aesthetic focuses on castle structure and the surrounding grounds, including knight training arenas and gardens. Sets of laws called sumptuary laws were placed to differentiate the types of fabrics, colors, and types of clothes for social classes. Royal wear consisted of many layers made from high-quality fabrics like silk, velvet, taffeta, wool and fur. Colors were also reserved for royalty, as vibrant colors like purple and gold could only be affordable to those of high status. Royalcore, as of now, mainly focuses on visual characteristics and contexts of historical European monarchies. This context is awaiting further extension to include other culturally significant aspects of royalty. Subgenres for royalcore may have page extensions listed below their descriptions. Visual references for royalcore can be taken from many different forms of media and history. These images can be inspiration for any modernized twist. Visuals can be from architecture to actions to artwork. Examples include: Listed alphabetically by country, then name of structure Imitation and real pieces exist on the market. It is possible to mix and match for a personalized expression of regality. In general, luxury materials prior to the Industrial Revolution are suitable. Seek out natural materials versus synthetics if possible. Patent leather would not be as chic as vegan leathers in a matte or suede finish, for example, because suede was delicate and therefore more costly. Eye-catching monochromatic ensembles are used by royalty to stand out in a crowd; bringing attention to themselves. Neutrals are all well and good, but the rest of the color wheel deserves its day. Most options are neither brown nor black to fit with the season To the basic ensemble of collared shirts and trousers, with a blazer jacket or entire suits, consider the opportunities for waistcoats and ascot ties. Explore print and textures over the safe choice of solid color and consider the rest of the color wheel, again, besides the safe choices of black, navy blue, and browns. * Whilst corsets, stays and other historical garments were neither restrictive nor uncomfortable for the masses, it is important to acknowledge that the fashions of royal European courts were  intended to limit movement, so as to reenforce the elite and toil-less lifestyle of the wearer. Knightcore is an aesthetic that is based on Medieval Knights. Not to be confused with Nightcore, the popular music style. Knightcore in a way could be someone \"simping\" or having a \"code of honor\". Knightcore is devoting yourself to a cause of goodness and righteousness in the views of equality and love for people, having a moral code for good, and being a protector in a friend group. For more information on this aesthetic, please visit the Knightcore page. Princecore is a young male variant of Royalcore, and is heavily based on male loving male (MLM) relationships (not to be confused with Multi-Level Marketing). Most of its popularity is on Tumblr. For more information on this aesthetic, please visit the Princecore page. Princesscore is a young female variant of Royalcore that usually involves long dresses. Some can be pastel, gothic, and/or etc. Many also have lace designs made into them. Crowns and beautiful jewelry are also involved in this aesthetic. This sub-genre is more carefree and juvenile. For more information on this aesthetic, please visit the Princesscore page. Kingcore is a more mature variant of Princecore with a more regal aesthetic compared to Princecore. For more information on this aesthetic, please visit the Kingcore page. Queencore is a more mature variant of Princesscore with a more regal aesthetic compared to Princesscore.

It was named \"rubber hose\" because of the fluid and elastic movement of the characters, resembling the movement of flexible rubber hoses. In this style, characters were drawn with simplified limbs and joints, without many anatomical details, allowing them to move in an exaggerated and elastic manner. This approach was adopted due to the technological limitations of the time, as it was more expensive for animation studios to use advanced techniques of movement and anatomy. The rubber hose style is known for its caricatured, humorous aesthetic and has been used in many classic cartoons. The invention of the rubber hose style is most often credited to American animator William “Bill” Nolan in the early 1920s, the design of characters in the rubber hose style was simplified, featuring round, simple shapes with minimal anatomical details. The limbs were often depicted as thin, elastic tubes, akin to actual rubber hoses. This simplified design allowed for greater flexibility and exaggerated movements, adding a sense of whimsy and humor to the animations. The rubber hose style became particularly popular in the animation industry during the golden age of animation, with iconic characters such as Mickey Mouse, Felix the Cat, and Betty Boop being brought to life in this distinctive style. The exaggerated and elastic movements of the characters added a unique charm and comedic effect to the cartoons. As animation technology advanced and more sophisticated techniques became available, the rubber hose style gradually gave way to more realistic and anatomically accurate animation styles. However, its influence can still be seen in modern works, as it laid the foundation for the development of animation as an art form. Today, the rubber hose style is celebrated for its nostalgic appeal and its contribution to the early history of animation. It holds a special place in the hearts of animation enthusiasts and continues to inspire contemporary animators who appreciate its playful and imaginative qualities. The rubber hose style of animation is characterized by specific visual elements that contribute to its unique and recognizable look. Here are some key features of the rubber hose style: While the rubber hose style was primarily popularized in the field of animation, its unique aesthetic has also influenced other creative sectors, such as product design and fashion. Here are some examples of products and fashion inspired by the rubber hose style: There have been several animated cartoons that embrace the Rubberhose style. Here are some notable examples:",

Generally this aesthetic imitates the style of the American Midwest, although portrayals can vary by region. A non-US version of this aesthetic comes from the Gaucho culture from Argentina and other regions of South America. By definition, Rusticcore has no real origin. The word “rustic” simply means something related to rural living and the countryside. However, the rise of the modern Rustic aesthetic can be traced back to the North American colonies in the 18th and 19th centuries. The style had been previously used in parts of Europe and England, but was popularized in large part due to the writings of Andrew Jackson Downing, a prominent landscape designer and horticulturalist. Unlike Cottagecore (which has, for the most part, a \"cleaner\" look), Rusticcore openly embraces the grit, dirt, and grime that often is associated with farm life and rural living and giving it a sort of Grunge vibe. Additionally, Rusticcore has a more stereotypically “masculine” feel in comparison to Cottagecore’s more stereotypically “feminine” feel. Common visuals in the aesthetic include: Rusticcore fashion is made up of practical, work clothes and/or homemade clothing made of simple materials such as wool and cotton. Fall colors, especially browns and reds are key.  Rusticcore fashion shares some overlap with Grunge, since a lot of original Grunge fashion was clothing that farmers and people like that wore because the clothing was intended to be long-lasting to be able to handle the wear and tear of the rigors of working on the farm. Common aspects of rustic fashion include: Most activities associated with the Rusticcore aesthetic involve things that would be usually be done in rural areas and farms. A lot of Rusticcore music involves folksy, acoustic music and has generally a loose, improvisational feel to it, like a bunch of friends gathered together on the front porch with whatever they could find and just have a jam session. Country and Folk are the genres most strongly associated with Rusticcore.

The main goal of Sacricore is for those negatively affected by Christian religions to find peace in their queer identities or otherwise morally acceptable interests, lifestyle, or choices (people who are divorced, have had abortions, are mentally ill, disabled, or neurodivergent, are Pagan or Wiccan, etc.) that have been labeled as sinful or practices that one is disallowed from pursuing, such as wanting to have a partner of the same gender, due to it being 'sinful'. Sacricore can be used in an atheist sense or a \"pro-Jesus, anti-Christianity\" sense. The Sacricore community and philosophy have two predominant denominations: Atheist and religious. Philosophy varies between the two. The Sacricore community generally supports LGBTQ+ rights, gender and racial equality, religious freedom, and freedom of speech. What \"sins\" are considered morally acceptable to celebrate in Sacricore are largely based around leftist beliefs. If said sin isn't harming others, ignoring the consent of others, or based on bigotry towards minorities (disrespecting Muslims or Jewish people is strictly off limits, they hold no power over you and disrespecting them would be punching down rather than up) then it is safe to assume Sacricore supports it. Although Sacricore is mainly based off of catholic aesthetics, DIY punk fashion, and has slight inspiration from Nu-Goth, what Sacricore can be absorbent of any kind if alt fashion. The different elements you place in your goth-punk-religious fusion outfit depends on what part of your identity you are using Sacricore to celebrate. Some elements of a Sacricore outfit could include a crucifix necklace, dirtied or tattered church clothes (modern or retro), pieces from a priest's cassock or nun's habit, crust pants / vests, bondage fashion such as harnesses and leather, 1800s gothic jewelry, fake thorn crowns, and accessories referencing demons and angels (clothing covered in eyes, fake horns, makeup that mimics wings, etc.).

As it is most known as Sad Beige Mom, the aesthetic is also majorly known for members DIY-ing and/or purchasing children's toys, clothing and decorations to beige and/or mute colors. One of the more popular examples of this is Nattie Jo Powell's TikTok and Instagram video of her spraypainting her daughter's play Christmas tree to mute colors, such as making the tree a dark xanadu color and the ornaments beige and tan.[1] The aesthetic was popularized from Kim Kardashian's household; displaying little to any color and mainly showing white as the only visible color in the house. Many commentary YouTubers such as FunkyFrogBait state this could be because of the more \"classy & clean\" look to the household compared to colorful children's toys, making the homeowner's house look more expensive.[2] External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic. At the rise of sad beige, netizens have been concerned for the development of the children of those who identify as sad beige moms. Newborns' vision takes time to fully develop, having difficulties identifying colors during their earliest years.[3] According to neuropsychologist Sanam Hafeez, MD, newborns are only able to see shades of black, gray and white at birth, making high-constrast colors important for better understanding their visual surroundings.[3] Although more bright & vibrant colors are suggested for language, visual, cognitive and emotional development, infants can have a moderate amount of black & white colors mixed with vibrants in their first learning environment.[3]",

Within the Sadpeople group, there are Sadbois/Sadboys, Sadenbies and Sadgirls-- these are simply gender terms and do not change the aesthetic's visuals for the person. Sadpeople often feel lost either mentally or physically, which is the reason why they revel in the aesthetic's tones. It has some relation to Traumacore, but Traumacore deals with physical abuse and abandonment, while Sadpeople is more about mental trauma. The Sadpeople aesthetic involves mental space, loneliness, and abandonment. Unlike Traumacore, the Sadpeople aesthetic tends to focus more on feelings of isolation, loneliness, and anxiety that don't necessarily come from CSA or some form of PTSD and distinctly lacks the child-like nature Traumacore tends to have. However, it can be a popular partner with a Liminal Space aesthetic to show off that loneliness the Sadpeople aesthetic is associated with as well as a sense of dread. Sadbois don't usually come with a specific style of clothes but they usually dress anywhere from Normcore to Grunge. Sadgirls don't usually come with a specific style of clothes but they usually dress anywhere from Grunge. There is also an element of the E-Girl aesthetic that can apply to Sadgirls, but the mentality that Sadgirls have makes the fashions hit different compared to their E-Girl counterparts. Sadenbies, similar to the Sadbois and Sadgirls, usually do not wear a specific kind of fashion and wear something similar to Grunge or Normcore trends usually. Sadcore is a subgenre of music that is an example of alternative rock characterized by bleak lyrics, downbeat melodies and slower tempos, or alternatively, songs with deceivingly upbeat melodies that are simultaneously characterized by depressive lyrical undertones or imagery.

It's considered one of the most important celebrations of Irish culture because it marked the arrival of Catholicism into the island, and it is usually held on 17th of March. This is an official public holiday in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Newfoundland and Labrador (Canada) and Montserrat, but it is also widely celebrated in the rest of the United Kingdom, Brittany (France), Galicia (Spain), the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, especially among the Irish diaspora. Out of every national holiday, Saint Patrick's Day is the most globally celebrated one around the world, even among those who are not Irish or of Celtic descent. This has led to the holiday being associated with traditional clichés, such as wearing green and shamrocks, dressing up as a leprechaun, drinking beer and whiskey, hanging up stereotypical decoration, among others. The global version of Saint Patrick's Day is sometimes criticized for being too commercialized and promoting negative stereotypes about Irish culture. In this article, both the traditional and global versions of the holiday will be documented and explained. Saint Patrick was born in the late 4th century in Britain, which was part of the Roman Empire at the time. At the age of 16, he was kidnapped by raiders and he was taken to Ireland, where he became a slave and was forced to work as a shepherd for six years. He managed to escape, although the location is debatable. Some legends suggest he fled to Wales or Cornwall, both in western Britain, while other legends claim he fled to Saint-Malo, in Brittany (northwestern France, at the time known as Armorica)[1]. Sometime around 432 AD, Saint Patrick returned to Ireland due to his spiritual experiences in the island. He spent decades travelling through Ireland, and he preached Christianity and estabilished churches and monasteries. He also helped spread literacy and education to the Irish people. Some legends claim that he got rid of the \"snakes\" and \"all the evil\" from Ireland, although that's in fact a despective metaphor for the Celtic Pagans[2], those who practiced the older beliefs of the island. Saint Patrick passed away on the 17th of March, 461 AD, becoming one of the most important patron saints of Ireland. The earliest Saint Patrick's Day religious celebrations can be traced back to the 9th and 10th centuries, when Irish Catholic communities tributed Saint Patrick on the day he passed away. During the 17th century, the holiday started to be officially observed by the Catholic Church, and the holiday became official in 1631 when the Church established a Feast Day honoring St. Patrick[3]. Centuries later, it became an official public holiday of the Republic of Ireland in 1903, with the Bank Holiday Act. The cultural evolution of the tradition started on the 18th century onwards, when the Great Famine happened and many Irish people had to immigrate to other countries in search for a better life. Many Irish diaspora communities were formed around the world, and they brought over their traditions (such as Saint Patrick's Day or Samhain, more known as Halloween) and used them as a way to connect with their heritage and maintain their distinct ethnic identity in their new home countries. Over time, the holiday became less religious, and the day transformed into a more secular celebration of Irish culture. Some stereotypical aspects of modern Saint Patrick's day include parades, traditional Irish music and dance, wearing green and leprechaun hats. Today it's a holiday celebrated all over the world, especially among countries with large Irish communities. In Ireland, Saint Patrick's Day may be notably more calm than in other countries, in fact, pubs used to be closed throughout the entire country on March 17th until 1970[4]. It has been celebrated for over 1000 years and it remains as a primarily religious celebration, tributing the arrival of Christianity to the island, as Catholicism became an important part of Irish culture and differenciated it from its neighbor cultures, such as the primarily Protestant Britain. Until the 17th century, it was a minor celebration, but since then, it became the national holiday of Ireland. In Ireland, it's often celebrated with parades, music, dance, and lots of green. The biggest parade takes place in the capital, Dublin, and attracts visitors from all over the world. Apart from partying, the holiday also has a more respectful and religious stance, with many people attend church services[5] to honor the patron saint, and other traditional activities include family gatherings, attending music sessions (céilí) or cooking Irish cuisine, and the currently minoritized Irish language might be spoken more often as a source of cultural pride. It is also a flag flying day in the country[6], and some of the flags flown in this day include the Irish tricolor, the Irish green harp flag or the flags of the traditional counties of the island (Munster, Leinster, Connacht and Ulster). The globalized version of Saint Patrick's Day became popular around the world through the Irish diaspora and their descendants, especially those who settled in the United States and Canada. The holiday still celebrates Irish culture, but with an obvious Americanized twist. Large-scale parades are the highlight, featuring floats, marching bands with bagpipes and other traditional Irish instruments, people dressed in green costumes with dyed red hair and flags of the Republic of Ireland defaced with a shamrock. Wearing green at sporting events, especially basketball and hockey, is a popular tradition. Pub celebrations are also common and many people use the holiday as their chance to drink excessively, particularly drinks like whiskey and beer, although this also leads to complications in the streets such as people puking on the floor, and some have also criticized the practice for promoting negative stereotypes such as \"Irish people are always drunk\". Foods and drinks consumed during the day include corned beef and cabbage, any food dyed green and Irish-themed dishes, like soda bread or shepherd's pie. Generally, some say Saint Patrick's Day is a bigger deal in the United States than in Ireland itself. Some iconic visuals in the globalized version of Saint Patrick's Day include: Some stereotypical costumes many people wear during Saint Patrick's Day include: The commercialized version of Saint Patrick's Day has been criticized for focusing on consumerism rather than the original religious value of the celebration. The inaccurate portrayal of Irish culture and symbolism in mass-produced merchandise is sometimes criticized for cultural appropiation, because for example shamrocks are turned into a marketable symbol rather than portrayed in its original religious context, and other symbols that perpetuate harmful stereotypes against Irish people, such as alcoholic drinks or the stereotype that all Irish people are red-haired, may be considered offensive by some.

Weapons, tools, clothing, and sometimes entire cities will be built out of repurposed/recycled materials. A key factor here is that said materials, often pieces of trash, are being used for something other than their original purpose (as opposed to simply being repaired and reused). In speculative fiction, this often takes place in the remnant of society after an apocalypse[1]. However, it can also be used to describe the reperpopusing rubbish in the contemporary era. This could include the DIY culture of Cuba discussed by Ernesto Oroza where people repurposed household electronic goods into new products due to the trade embargos on the country[2]. The commonplace refurbishing of western e-waste in developing countries where they are resold and used again[3]. In music critique, the term has been used to describe the repurposing and reforming of cultural detritus. Mark Fisher described Oneohtrix Point Never’s “Nobodies here” as salvagepunk due to it’s sampling of Chris de Burgh’s “Lady in Red”. Summarising Evan Calder Williams' Fisher says: Salvagepunk could be thought of as differentiated from less optimistic post-apocalyptic aesthetics as it draws heavily on rebuilding as a motif, these are the terms used by xenogothic to discuss it in “The Philosophy of Salvagepunk”[5]. Colors in salvagepunk consist mostly of neutral colors like bronze, brown, tan, and black, but also stretch to yellows, greens, and reds. Post apocalyptic imagery is the staple of salvagepunk. Rusted, old objects, broken machines, and vandalized decrepit buildings are some of the most present. Multi-purpose items, scrap metal, and other pieces of trash also create the reused nature of the aesthetic. Barricades are another salvagepunk motif, as are collage and photomontage similar to the kinds found in the Dada and Surrealist artistic movements. Combines many different genres, but takes elements steampunk, goth, and grunge most. These elements may include: Just like it's fashion, salvagepunk music elapses many genres, such as rock, heavy metal, alternative rock. Hip-hop, with its culture of sampling (as well as early DJ culture for the same reason), and derivatives of anarcho-punk, such as post-punk and post-rock, are especially salvagepunk.",

Kind words are encouraged and celebrated, as they contribute to a supportive and inclusive atmosphere. Furthermore, rainbows, symbolizing diversity and acceptance, are incorporated to emphasize the importance of embracing differences and fostering a sense of belonging for all students. In the early 2000s, as concerns regarding bullying in schools began to gain traction, educators and administrators sought innovative approaches to address this issue. It was during this time that the concept of SABPR was conceived.

It differs from most other academic aesthetics, which center on the arts and humanities. Science Academia's visuals vary among disciplines, but they share some common traits. Like many other academic aesthetics, science academia visuals are predominantly inspired by photographs from and paraphernalia prevalent in academic settings during the late 19th and early 20th century. The most popular branches of science presented in visuals and communities are mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, microbiology, human anatomy, and physiology. Science academia is often described as Dark Academia applied to the sciences. The appreciation of scientific knowledge and a desire to discover are the main motifs of science academia. Science academics strive to gain knowledge for its own sake and for personal enjoyment, rather than to accomplish obligatory means. The life of the mind is the best life, and everything is worth discovering. Whether it be biology, physics or anything in between, science acts as an incredible insight into not only the nature of the universe, but ourselves. Science academia’s fashion is very similar to Chaotic Academia and Classic Academia, with influence from the uniforms and formal wear of the 20th century. Silhouettes are generally fitted or tailored, and baggy clothes are often avoided. Color choices usually consist of neutral or earthy tones with the occasional pops of red, green, blue, and purple. All fabrics from wool and tweed to linen and cotton may be worn. Patterns are simplistic, with plaid and argyle being frequent. As is the case with all academia aesthetics, activities usually involve the pursuit of knowledge in some way or another. Science academia simply applies the sciences to said academic activities.

Scrapbook themes are usually colorful and childlike. Scrapbooking has existed in some form since the 15th century.  Around the years 2001-2006 scrapbooking was at its peak with the scrapbooking industry doubling in size. Traditional scrapbooking and collage making has been a popular hobby for many, and to this day people post pictures of their scrapbooks and artworks. This aesthetic or style has inspired many in various media. With the eased access to the internet and photo taking with digital cameras in the early 2000s, digital scrapbooking saw its beginning. Some internet user posted a picture of their friend's selfie, edited like a scrapbook, and since then the scrapbook way of editing pictures has stayed as a staple for the editing community. Traditional scrapbook making but also editing is especially common in K-pop spheres due to the abundance of material found in a typical K-pop album. Even so, this type of photo editing is found in all corners of the internet. Scrapbooking is often defined by using mixed media and a lot of material, be it digital or traditional. There are no rules for scrapbooking, which is why it can be hard to point out what is or isn't scrapbook. Typical materials include photographs, garbage, printed media, artwork, paper, stickers, cut-outs and more. Scrapbooks and scrapbook-inspired images are often very decorated and frequently contain extensive journal entries or written descriptions. A lot of media that is inspired by scrapbook also feature elements from other aesthetics or visual directions. This is especially noticeable in media made around the scrapbook boom, e.g. the game series LittleBigPlanet (2008-2014) which has often been referred to as having a Frutiger Metro look. There are also several variants of scrapbook, which could be considered its own sub-aesthetics: This variant of the aesthetic features bright soft, vibrant colors, child-like drawings, stickers, clippings and photos; however the art may feature photos and newspaper clippings of adults. Small 2D crafts (e.g. plasticine pressed flat to make a picture) are seen here as well. This type of scrapbook is quite common, especially amongst teens in high school and tweens. These scrapbooks are usually quite personal and can contain photos of the person with their friends. The art usually has vintage and VSCO themes as well as child-like themes, but colors and imagery can vary. This aesthetic is also a very popular type of Scrapbook. This aesthetic has Lovecore motifs and values, but often fewer pinks and more warm colors. The scrapbooks usually feature teen girls, love quotes, vintage magazine clippings and heart doodles.

The music often incorporates ocean sounds and electronic beats. Seapunk was extremely popular in the late 2000s and early 2010s until it started to get mainstream too quickly (being utilized by the likes of Lady Gaga and Katy Perry), culminating in the infamous (to the scene) Rihanna performance on Saturday Night Live of her hit song \"Diamonds\", which co-opted a lot of Seapunk imagery and aesthetics during it. After this incident, Seapunk fell in popularity and was eventually replaced by the very similar Vaporwave (which, admittedly, has had an easier time enduring popularity due to how all-encompassing it is compared to the very specific Seapunk).  Despite this, however, there have been rumblings in the Vaporwave community of possibly a Seapunk renaissance, to serve as happy fun-time music to pair with the normally moody and atmospheric Vaporwave music (when they aren't listening to Future Funk, anyways). The term \"seapunk\" was coined by Brooklyn-based DJ Julian Foxworth, better known as Lil Internet. He claims the term came to him in a surreal dream, which he tweeted to his followers on June 1st, 2011. The next month, the first seapunk record label, Coral Records Internazionale, established by Chicago-based producer Ultrademon, launched a Bandcamp page and Facebook fan page where they shared links of other unaffiliated artists that exemplify the music they wanted to release. One of the earliest releases that were specifically classified as seapunk was Zombelle and Myrrh Ka Ba’s five-song EP \"Tropicult\", made available to download for free on July 26th, 2011. That October, Coral Records held the first Seapunk showcase in Brooklyn, coinciding with that year’s College Music Journal Festival, featuring Lil Internet and five other DJs and performers. Azealia Banks is noted for her visuals heavily inspired by mermaids and Seapunk, most notably her Fantasea mixtape and the music video for her song Atlantis. Visually, a lot of Seapunk visuals will remind people of early CGI graphics one would see from the 90s either on shows or movies that were experimenting with this new technology or from Trapper Keepers (which were popular with kids in the 90s) with a lot of early CGI water effects, oceanic scenery, and old school video games often brought into the mix to really highlight the nineties-ness of the aesthetic. Seapunk's rise in popularity not only gave way for Vaporwave (which also co-opted similar aesthetic cues, but was broader with the net it cast compared to the laser-focused aesthetics of Seapunk), but also inspired other aesthetics such as Slimepunk (which had more of a grungy and slimy vibe) and Icepunk (which had more of an icy vibe to it, like ice levels in a video game).  It also had an indirect inspiration on Ocean Grunge (no doubt due to the fact regular Grunge was a follow-up to Punk like Ocean Grunge was to Seapunk). The style originated in 2011 as a trend on the micro-blogging platform Tumblr. The music is an edgy mix of modern-day electronic music, with heavy influences from the 2000s. This crossover continues into the fashion, which is generally uses nautical/aquatic imagery, such as marine life and palm trees composed of pastel and/or neon colors, primarily variations on cyan/teal, lavender, and pinks, and contains many symbols prominent during the 2000's such as yin and yang symbols and smiley faces. Other seapunk staples include: Like Witch House and Vaporwave, Seapunk is a microgenre steeped in nostalgia for that not-so-distant time known as the nineties. Rave, R&B, and dance music constitute major elements of the seapunk sound. There’s also an undercurrent of spookiness that comes from 2000's mall goth music and the parts of the ocean that sunlight can’t reach, although that aspect of Seapunk is downplayed compared to Witch House. Lyrical topics include dancing, partying, hooking up, and the ocean. Always the ocean. Musicians in the genre include:",

The movement was mainly expressed through visual arts and consisted of preserving Breton culture by incorporating it into modern art and aesthetics and revitalizing traditional art techniques from the region. It also had its manifestations on architecture and furniture design. Today, it is recognized as a precessor modern Celtic art in the region of Brittany, although it is sometimes discredited due to its historical controversies.  \nThe group behind this art movement was a collective of many artists, with some of the most notable ones being Paul Ladmirault, Jef Le Penven, Paul Le Flem, Xavier de Langleiz, Jean Freour, Yann Goulet, Francis Renaud, Jules-Charles Le Bozec, Raffig Tullou, James Bouillé and many more. Despite the fact that many people were involved in the art project,  at its peak it only had only 15 members. The term \"Seiz Breur\" itself is derivated from a Breton folk story, and it's a common misconception to assume \"Seiz Breur\" refers to the number of artists in the movement.  \nThe movement surged as an Avant-garde approach to pop culture and prevalent trends in the fine arts of Brittany, with ideas similiar to the Arts and Crafts Movement. It  rejected French centralization and French artistic trends and promoted the idea that Breton art had become 'stagnant' due to the spread of non-Breton art movements and the influence of mass media. The Seiz Breur movement started in Brittany, a region located in northwestern France, which is known for its Celtic heritage and culture. To understand this movement, it's important to know that the region of Brittany used to be a country separate from France, until it was absorbed by the Kingdom of France in the year 1532 and was granted special privileges. The Bretons resisted French centralization for several years, until the French Revolution in 1789. During the French Revolution, the Jacobin faction believed that \"France was one and undivisible\", and therefore they sought to get rid of all of the \"patois\" (regional languages) spoken in France, including the Breton and Gallo languages, both historically spoken in the region. Parisian culture was imposed in France as a whole, and it became more centralized than it already was in the past, leading to the endangerment of its indigenous cultures. During the late 18th century, the Romanticism movement became an international tendency in Europe, encouraging Romantic Nationalism in multiple countries and regions, including Brittany. This constitutes the cultural background and cause of the Seiz Breur movement. The early origins of Seiz Breur can be traced to the works of the artist Jeanne Malivel, who played an important role on the creation of the art movement and was initially the leader of Seiz Breur. Jeanne Malivel is known for her usage of the traditional wood engraving technique in her artworks, as well as illustrating the book L'Histoire de notre Bretagne by writer Jeanne Coroller-Danio. She was an important figure of the movement and although she was a young and aspiring artist, she unfortunately passed away 3 years later after the foundation of Seiz Breur in 1923, and her style and influence was picked up by other artists of the movement, like René-Yves Creston, Suzanne Creston and James Bouillé.  \nThe Seiz Breur movement was founded in 1923 by a group of various Breton artists and intellectuals who sought to promote and revitalize Breton culture. The name \"Seiz Breur\" translates to \"Seven Brothers\" in the Breton language and refers to a Breton folklorical story. Its name symbolizes the fact that the movement was born out of a desire to counteract the cultural assimilation imposed by France's centralist policies and to celebrate the unique cultural heritage of Brittany.  \nIn 1925, the group behind the Seiz Breur movement participated on L’Exposition des Arts Décoratifs of Paris.  \nIn 1928, they launch the review Kornog in which the Seiz Breur artists write their theories and ideas. The group stars calling itself Unvaniez Seiz Breur (Union of Seven Brothers), in contrast with the art movement's name.  \nIn 1929, the group participated in an art exhibition in Douarnenez.  \nIn 1931, they replace the Kornog journal with another journal called Keltia.  \nIn 1937, the group participates in the Pavillon de la Bretagne exposition in Paris.  \nIn 1939, World War II stars, causing the mobilization of various members of the art movement. 1 year later, they publish the Programme de Seiz Breur dans un manifeste en 13 points, a book which recopilates their ideas. From 1940 to 1944, various art exhibitions named Eost Breiziz (Breton Harvest), mainly in the cities of Rennes and Paris.  \nIn 1944, things started to go down. Xavier de Langlais replaced René-Yves Creston as the president of the group, and the members started to identify with different political values. Various years later, in 1948, after the Second World War, the group behind this movement broke up due to ideological differences (See Controversy).  Despite the fact the original group was disbanded, it still had an important influence in the region of Brittany and many Breton artists continue to be inspired by their original artworks. Seiz Breur surged as a reaction against popular art movements that appeared in Brittany due to the influence of French mass media. The movement aimed to promote Breton traditions and identity through various art forms, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, and graphic design. The movement would combine modern artistic techniques with traditional Breton motifs and craftsmanship, like the ermine, the triskelion or the Celtic knot. Artists of this movement, such as Jeanne Malivel and René-Yves Creston, drew inspiration from the region's folklore, legends, and rural traditions to make their artworks. They incorporated elements of Celtic art, geometric patterns, and monochrome colour palettes into their works. The Seiz Breur movement created its own aesthetic with the goal to combine old Breton art with modern styles, featuring elements such as traditional wood carvings, faience, stoneware, stained glass windows, sculpture, ironwork, cabinetmaking, embroidery, weaving, fresco, illustration, typography, etc., and the usage of new materials, like concrete, and new techniques like photocollage or cinematography. Another important part of the Seiz Breur movement was the fact that it would difuse its artworks in various forms rather than just traditional painting, like book illustrations, postcards, stamps, calendars, jewellery, toys, furniture, cushions, mugs and posters.  \nBeing a really traditional aesthetic, it also drew inspiration from Breton history, Druidism, Religion (Both Christian and Celtic Pagan), maritime life, folklorical legends and Celtic mythology, including Breton, Welsh, Irish and Galician mythology. In 1942, the Institut Celtique de Bretagne was founded, which brought together several persons from all over Brittany together to discuss the Celtic heritage of Brittany, as well as promote the Neo-Celtic movement in the region. The artists of the Seiz Breur movement joined the Celtic Institute, and unfortunately the ideologies of the members started to shift. Some members of the movement like Olier Mordrel and Yann Goulet became excessively nationalistic, embracing ideologies like Nazism, hoping that the Nazi Germans could support the Breton independence movement, however that wasn't the original goal of the movement at all. Meanwhile, other members of the group resisted those sentiments and continued to only politically agree with Breton nationalism/patriotism/regionalism or French federalism. These ideological differences between the members eventually led to the breakup of the group in 1948, also discrediting their work due to their bad reputation. However, it's important to note only a few members of the movement were linked to the far-right.",

The nature aspect features rocky beaches, jagged shorelines, and the cold ocean itself, set against a mysterious background of fog and mist.  The setting is usually Ireland and Scotland, as well as Scandinavian countries like Norway, Sweden, and Finland. Harbors, coastal towns and lighthouses are part of this aesthetic as well, provided they feature gray cloudy skies, or cold dark waters. The aesthetic is similar to Mermaidcore, but less colorful and flashy, favoring cooler, darker and neutral colors. While Dark Nautical centers on the sailors, the fishermen, and the mysteries of the sea itself, Selkiecore is more about mythological sea creatures as well as other marine life, their nature, and their habitat, with a heavy Northern European influence. Selkies are mythological beings capable of therianthropy, changing from seal to beautiful human form by shedding their skin, sometimes into a coat. They are found in folktales and mythology originating from the Northern Isles of Scotland. The folk-tales frequently revolve around female selkies having their seal skin or coat being stolen and hidden. The thief will then coerce them into relationships or straight up marriage thus exhibiting the tale motif of the swan maiden type. The selkie wife trapped on land will spend her time longing for the sea, her true home, and will often be seen gazing longingly at the ocean. She may bear several children by her human husband, but once she discovers her skin, she will immediately return to the sea. Sometimes she will abandon the children she loved, or she will take the children with her. Sometimes, one of her children discovers or knows the whereabouts of the skin. Sometimes it is revealed she already had a first husband of her own kind. Although in some children's story versions, the selkie revisits her family on land once a year, in the typical folktale she is never seen again by them. Male selkies are described as being very beautiful in their human form, and having great seductive powers over humans. They typically seek those who are dissatisfied with their lives, such as married women waiting for their fishermen/sailormen husbands. Male selkies can be summoned by shedding seven tears into the sea. There are counterparts in Faroese and Icelandic folklore that speak of seal-women and seal-skin. Though the aesthetic is named after and mostly centers on selkies, the aesthetic also centers on the marine life of the sea of Ireland, Scotland, Norway, Sweden or Finland. As you may have noticed, many aesthetics divide the fashion category into \"men's\" and \"women's\" but don't feel restricted to one category or the other. You're welcome to pick and choose pieces from each for your personal look.",

One of the key ideas of the Sentimentalist movement is the \"liberation of a person through the use of art and knowledge\". The movement was characterized by its focus on the emotional and the personal, rather than on the rational and the objective. Sentimentalism was born as an Avant-garde movement and it was started in Lugo during the 1970s by Xesús Manuel Valcárcel. The movement was promoted by Spanish jornals such as El Progreso and radio programs such as Cadena SER. The theorical base of Sentimentalism is   presented as a trilogy formed by the plays Animal sentimental, Dialéctica sentimental e Práctica sentimental, published by Ir Indo Edicións. According to the texts, \"Sentimentalism is all based around the boredom and end of Western traditional rationalism, and the need to find new alternatives and the importance of feelings, and reclaiming ancestral knowledge and embracing the rich variety of cultures and peoples\". The visuals of Galician Sentimentalism focused on the rejection of the prevalent art techniques in Western Europe. Another important aspect of Sentimentalism was its use of symbolism. The artists of this movement often used symbols and metaphors to convey their emotions and ideas. Their artworks used motifs such as vivid colors, distorted art, and a focus on the emotional and the personal. Sentimentalism started out as the rejection of the prevalent Western Rationalist philosophy and art, and the need to find new and different artistic movements. Sentimentalism defends the liberty of a person, the right to education, personal independence, democracy, respect,  the freedom to have an opinion (and in particular, opinions regarding politics, society and religion) and the globalization of knowledge and culture. The movement also promotes the awareness of consumerism and how society associates property and wealth with happiness. As an spiritual movement, Sentimentalists believe in the liberation of the soul through art and culture, and sees art as something magical. Sentimentalism describes life as a \"game\" - you can progress, go back, lose or win. Note: Most if not all of the information on this movement is only avaiable in Galician or Spanish. \nExternal links can help you get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

Sextrance songs are characterized by their fast tempo (with the songs particularly being played at over 180bpm), strong synths, bitcrushed sounds, pulsating tones, and compressed and distorted sounds. The tracks are usually either really short or extremely long, often building up an energetic and emotional atmosphere preceding a bass drop. Samples and references to 2000s-2010s anime and videogames are another important aspect of Sextrance, with many musical artists incorporating audio samples or snippets from popular media from this time period to their songs. The genre is also notable for its distinctive Y2K Futurism-inspired aesthetic, featuring nostalgic elements such as old internet graphics, trading cards, 2000s videogames, cars, 3D anime characters, etc. It can be associated with many similiar nostalgic genres originating from Soundcloud and other underground communities, such as Xpiritualism or Sigilkore. Generally it is mostly associated with Xpiritualism, as both are influenced by HexD music.  \nIt has particularly developed a significant fanbase on RateYourMusic, Bandcamp and SoundCloud, as well as other online underground music communities. The term \"Sextrance\" was originally coined as a joke by the musical artist purity://filter to describe the album \"Imago\" (released in December 24, 2020) as well as a mix the artist made in Halloween 2022[3]. However, the term started being adopted by other similiar musical artists, and it quickly attracted a dedicated fanbase thanks to record label Dismiss Yourself. However, Purity Filter does not take credit for the creation of Sextrance, and prefers it to be attributed to other artists who picked up the idea like Sienna Sleep or Exodia. Sextrance often utilizes imagery that is reminiscent of the 2000s and the Y2K Futurism era, especially content like video games, anime shows and other media (with samples of songs with similar content). Video games play a significant role in the visual representation of Sextrance, with many artists incorporating old game graphics,  fictional characters and Low Poly, pixelated imagery from popular games of the time. Content originating from racing videogames, rhythm games and first-person shooter games are often used in music videos and cover art design. Anime is also a prominent visual aspect of Sextrance. Many artists incorporate visual elements that feature anime characters--like collectible cards, anime figure boxes and 3D models--as well as anime characters and aesthetics into their works. This often includes classic anime shows from the 2000s that combine elements of Japanese pop culture with rave culture. In addition to pop culture, Sextrance sometimes also includes old memes from the 2000s.  \nOther aspects of the aesthetic include its use of bright, holographic colors and color-changing hues. Distortion and compression effects are also commonly used to create a sense of chaos or disorientation. Another important feature of Sextrance is the use of content relating to Webcore, which is expressed through visuals, song/album titles and stage names.

The look focuses on a rustic and feminine appearance, with white and pastel colors, delicate motifs such as lace and filigree, and floral linen bedding. There is also a range of the levels of \"shabbiness\" and maximalism that a person can choose to express, with some decorators only using the color palette and nods to the look, while others choose to have a more cluttered and kitschy home. People who appreciate the aesthetic tend to only express it through home decor and, because of the time period when it became popular, are typically adult women who follow more traditional values of Christian society. That being said, the style has also regained popularity on social media among young women who subscribe to aesthetics like Dollette, Cottagecore, and Pink Princess. The aesthetic was created around the 1960s, and gained popularity in the 1980s through home decor magazines. Today, there are multiple companies that capitalize on this aesthetic, such as Rachel Ashwell, nonspecific furniture manufacturers, and independent shops on Etsy. Despite the availability of such furniture, many bloggers and magazines emphasize the importance of thrifting and DIY-ing furniture to adapt it to the readers' tastes. Other than home decor, fans of the look typically have hobbies adjacent to the vintage and feminine aesthetic, such as gardening, baking, sewing, and reading. Despite the resemblance to Cottagecore and Grandmacore, a typical fan of Shabby Chic would be unaware of these related aesthetics as they follow Western print magazines and blogs within the community instead of being on Gen-Z and Millennial-driven social media.",

Very similar to Emo and Scene subcultures or Japan's Visual Kei, Shamate involves spiking one's hair and dying it unnatural colors, dark makeup focusing on the eyes and lips, and shocking/statement-making accessories such as religious symbols, dog collars, or anything representing death and darkness. Shamate comes from the English translation of \"smart\" and initially took off with migrant factory workers in Southern China in the late 2000s-early 2010s.  Its creator, Luo Fuxing, stated in an segment with Vice Asia that it was done largely for entertainment because of how boring and lifeless factory life could be, where the only outlets for entertainment were the internet, video games, hanging out in the park, and styling one's hair.  Being one of the first internet users in his village of Dongguan, he was heavily inspired by the Visual Kei aesthetic (but admits he knew nothing about the music associated with it) and started by initially mimicking what he saw with the Visual Kei style. [1]  It really started to take off from 2009 to 2013 and at its peak, there were about 20,000 shamate, but the community has shrunk since then, but the ones who are still involved in the shamate community have become incredibly strict adherents to it.  In recent years, however, the shamate community has seen something of a resurgence, especially on platforms like TikTok. Shamate followers tend to wear dark makeup, such as eyeliner. Their hair is spiked and tends to be dyed, typically red, yellow, or blue, although other colors are incredibly popular within shamate. [2]  It was also incredibly popular to use temporary spray dye for their hairstyles initially due to the fact that if your hair was too outrageous in terms of color and style, many Chinese factories simply would not hire you. Much like the iconic shamate hair, shamate fashion is designed to be eye-catching and help them stand out, which had made them generally hated by Chinese society as a whole (not helped by the fact that many shamate tended to be lower-class workers, and the irony of the fact that shamate help to keep the Chinese economy going isn't lost on the shamate devotees).  As the backlash against the shamate from mainstream society increased, the shamate went even further underground, but it still pops up in other places in China from time to time.  Despite the mainstream backlash against shamate, shamate devotees don't necessarily have the same level of disdain for mainstream culture as a whole.  Clothing-wise, a lot of shamate will rock anything ranging from fake luxury clothing brands to fashion influenced by Korean fashion to Western-style Punk, Scene, and Emo fashion. Musically, the Shamate community tend to listen to a lot of Shout Mai, K-Pop, electronic music, and Visual Kei music, despite their appearance leading many Westerners to think they might listen to Rock or Metal music. shamate.org",

It largely overlaps with the Y2K Futurism aesthetic. The style originated with a year 2000 Sega Dreamcast game known as Jet Set Radio (or Jet Grind Radio in some areas), which was praised for its distinct art direction at the time, even pioneering the use of cel-shaded graphics in video games as a whole. However, its roots took shape much earlier with SEGA games like Crazy Taxi and Space Channel 5, which experimented with the traditional formula in gaming at the time. Jet Set Radio gained a cult-following, and both it and its 2002 sequel, Jet Set Radio Future, would have its style, art and music as an influence or inspiration for indie titles in the late 2010s and early 2020s. These games include, but are not limited to; Lethal League and Lethal League Blaze, Hover, No Straight Roads, Butterflies, and many more. These games furthered the style that is known today as Shibuya Punk. Another game that may have inspired the style is The World Ends With You, released in 2007 on the Nintendo DS. Much like Jet Set Radio, the game was praised for its stylish presentation, including its angular, occasionally surreal art style courtesy of Tetsuya Nomura and Gen Kobayashi; music inspired by Hip-Hop, Rock, and Electronica; and focus on Japanese street culture, fashion trends, and even cuisine. An anime known as Air Gear debuted in the 2000's, which also features roller-skating gangs, and some music was provided by Hideki Naganuma, the composer for Jet Set Radio and Jet Set Radio Future. Tying in with Japanese Turn of the Millennium graphic design and speculative Cyberpunk, Shibuya Punk's namesake also stems from the real life Tokyo Metropolis ward of Shibuya. Long considered both a place of pass-by's and youth culture, Tokyo residents consider Shibuya the \"crossroads\" or \"heart of Tokyo.\" Shibuya is considered the most socially interactive and trendsetting neighborhood in Tokyo, being known to be where residents throughout Tokyo crossover and mingle on its bustling streets. The juxtaposition of various lifestyles, fashion trends, music, and visual art means making waves in Shibuya eventually catches on everywhere else, and helps add to the character of Shibuya itself. However, Shibuya Punk is also representative of other places within Tokyo, such as the neon-drenched red-light districts of Shinjuku and the Otaku-influencing style of Akihabara. In the late-2000's, the style began to fall out of fashion, being slowly replaced by Superflat Pop, which has similar motifs but is inspired by the works of Takashi Murakami. However, in the mid-2010s, the release of Splatoon on the Nintendo Wii U, and its sequels, reinvigorated the interest in the self-expression, music, and art key to the Shibuya Punk style. The resurgence in interest of games similar to Jet Set Radio and the many titles inspired by it persists to present day, bolstered further by the release of Bomb Rush Cyberfunk and announcement of a new Jet Set Radio title in late 2023. The music for the aesthetic is varied and unique, ranging from aggressive and in-your-face to relaxed and chill. The most notable genres are Shibuya-kei and \"Naganuma-kei\", a term coined by Sashko Naganuma (check video description), describing a type of music made by famous video-game music composer Hideki Naganuma and fans of him. Naganuma-kei is an upbeat, catchy genre that takes inspiration from J-pop, Hip-Hop, Funk, EDM, Rock, Acid Jazz, Trip-Hop, Metal, Downtempo, Drum & Bass, Jungle, Big Beat, Chiptune, and many other genres based in, or influenced by, the Y2K Futurism era of the late 90s/early 2000s. Most Shibuya Punk music relies on heavy use of vocal and musical samples, sound effects, and jingles that have been altered in bizarre and innovative ways—often cut, rearranged, chopped, screwed, and sped up beyond recognition. Underground and lesser-known alternative music are key staples of the aesthetic in general, however the most recently known musicians fitting the aesthetic are Porter Robinson and 2 Mello. Additionally, many bands and artists who released music under the Beastie Boys' now-defunct record label, \"Grand Royal,\" such as Scapegoat Wax and The Latch Brothers, fit the aesthetic's eccentric, rebellious feeling. Notably, several Future Funk artists featured in the Lethal League games and Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, such as AAron EVO, SKALP, and Otis McDonald originally had their music included in the Dutch electronic music compliations, MORE BOUNCE presents: Feeding U New Knocks, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, by Amsterdam-based indie record label Wicked Wax. These artists give Shibuya Punk music another groovy dimension, steeped in bouncy 1970s and 80s boogie-funk from the Dutch House scene. As genre, Shibuya Punk revolves around the core idea of sampling, utilizing drum loops from other genres like breakbeat, funk, and hip hop, and are chopped and/or layered onto one another. Chord progressions often stay simplistic throughout the song, but vary slightly during the chorus. In Sneakman by Hideki Naganuma, the key doesn't move from the tonic key of A minor until about 30 seconds into the song, only then does it elaborate to i-iii-iv-viii. In Like It Like This Like That, it stays in the tonic key of B♭ major throughout the entire song, with the only variation being the dominant V chord at the last bar of each measure, making for an incredibly basic, yet catchy I-V progression. Similar to old school house music, chord progressions usually stay in a certain major or minor chord due to stabs and hits being hard wired to be a certain chord, and usually in 5ths or 4ths, but sometimes go into 7ths or even 9ths. Another thing to note about Hideki's writing style is his extensive use of stutters, repetition, 5th chords, and quarter triplet notes. If you listen to some of his songs (such as Funky Dealer, Sneakman, and Let Mom Sleep), there's a common pattern involving 3 notes that are specifically pronounced when they play. He also repeats and stutters patterns to keep the song engaging and to give it that DJ feel. Instrumentation is widely varied, but is rarely ever played with real instruments, instead opting for samples and loops. The only songs that uses MIDI playback are the tracks JACK DA FUNK and GET ENUF from the Bomb Rush Cyberfunk OST, where Hideki opted to use a Roland Jupiter-8 synth plugin. For the bass, instruments such as slap bass loops or synth/acid sequences are used to create a sort of droning or repetition effect that follow the drums. Orchestra hits/stabs, distorted guitars, organs, trumpets, saxophones, and synthesized sequences are often used, being pitched and chopped to create a melody. Vocals are either voice clips from sample CDs or from vintage clips such as movies or speeches, and punchy adlibs such as \"uh\" or \"yeah\". All of the compositions by both Hideki Naganuma and Richard Jacques for Jet Set Radio & Future use samples from CDs published during the 90's. SEGA provided their musicians with an arsenal of CDs such as Zero-G Datafile 1, 2 and 3, Ueberschall Big Beat, Big Fish Audio Big Beat Megaton Bomb vol. 4, Norman Cook - Skip To My Loops, X-Static Goldmine: Disc 2, and many more.",

Although the art style of shoujo can vary from artist, there are generally distinct characteristics in lots of shoujo manga, such as large and detailed eyes, as well as slender figures on characters. The first officially recognised shoujo is \"Princess Knight\" by Osamu Tezuka, one of his earliest works published in the magazine \"Shojo Club\" in 1953. This manga served as inspiration for several artists to create manga tailored to teenage girls. Many of these influential artists, such as Shotaro Ishimori and Fujio Fujio, were among the first talentscontributing to the establishment of the shoujo genre alongside Osamu Tezuka. Later in the Showa era, a big wave of shoujo manga artists emerged consecutively, forming what would later be known as the \"Year 24 Group\". One notable work from that time was \"Tokyo Babylon,\" acclaimed as \"the first philosophical shoujo manga\" of the modern era, created by CLAMP. The series was highly praised for adressing and exposing the dark aspects of Japan's society. Despite being one of CLAMP's earliest works, it quickly gained a large following even among adults. Notably, the depiction of the same-sex attraction between Seishirou and Subaru in \"X\" became a classic trope, known for its profundity and tragic narrative. Even today, CLAMP still remains a renowned group of female manga artists, along with other notable figures such as Ikeda Riyoko, Hagio Boto, Oshima Yumiko, and Yoshizumi Wataru, among others. Even while many of the most popular shoujo artists are women, there's also also male artists, like Wada Yuki, the same way there are female artists in shonen, such as Takahashi Rumiko, nowadays. Shoujo mangas have many features in their art style that differentiate from other styles and genres, one of the most well known features being the eyes of the characters. Eyes in shoujo manga typically have large pupils, shading and highlights within the eye and on the eyelid, and small lines surrounding the iris to make the eye look more \"delicate\"[1]. Although the eyes are typically big, they are often times drawn smaller on male or older characters.",

Computer-generated imagery (or CGI for short) and its origin can be traced back to the Late 1950s and 60s, when computers were able to render lines and patterns. But the conventional idea of \"CGI\" as we know today wouldn't start until the 1970s, were they started to generate 3D models for the first time. A notable example from the time being \"Computer Animated Hand\" from 1972, which is considered the first 3D computer animation to be ever created. By the 1980s, CGI began to technologically evolve at a faster rate and slowly being introduced to the mass public through advertisements and TV bumpers. It was also during this time when the common attributes associated with Silicon Dreams start to become a lot more apparent, with demos like Quest (1985), Brilliance (1985), Mental Images (1987), Deja Vu (1987), Polly Gone (1988), and the first Pixar shorts like Luxo Jr. (1986), Tim Toy (1988), and Knick Knack (1989). During the following decade, the 1990s, CGI starts to get into the mainstream media, with new blockbuster movies and TV shows beginning to adopt these technologies, since it was starting to get more commercially viable then ever before. All of that led to the release of the first CGI feature-length animated film Toy Story in 1995, and Cassiopeia in 1996, which furthered the advancements in CGI that were happening in the 90s. Despite the leaps in CGI technology between the 80s and 90s, there was a consistent visual identity that was present in 3D animation. It was characterized by sparse landscapes or architecture, low-resolution textures, simple visual effects and objects, environments, and 3D models that are surreal and \"out of this world\" in nature, like something that came out of a dream. Silicon Dream ended by the Mid-2000s when CGI in animated movies, shows, and advertising became advanced enough and the norm of the industry (i.e. Frutiger Aero). In the 2010s, the aesthetic had a revival on the internet by the rise of aesthetics like Vaporwave and Seapunk, which ended up being used as a tool to complement the visuals of these aesthetics or to create a sense of nostalgia of a bygone time. Silicon Dreams often includes images, artwork, and shorts made with early CGI from the 80s to 90s, a majority of them being Sci-Fi themed, landscapes or even CGI architecture. A lot of imagery included simplistic polygons, textures, and lighting, due to the technical limitations of the time. The Silicon Dreams aesthetic was also commonly seen in Trapper Keepers of the 90s; loose-leaf binders made by the stationary company Mead that were used for the sake of organizing school supplies for students. This could also be seen as the connecting tissue between it and more modern-ish aesthetics such as Vaporwave, Seapunk, Icepunk, Slimepunk, and Y2K Futurism. At the time when Silicon Dreams started, many people used computers to generate imagery. In the 2010s, Silicon Dreams was utilized as an element in Vaporwave music/aesthetics, be it from Oneohtrix Point Never's music video for Nobody Here (which some pinpoint as the very first example of Vaporwave music put out into the wild) as well as the music video for Macintosh Plus's Lisa Frank 420.  The Vaporwave connection could be considered a carryover from when the Seapunk community gravitated towards Vaporwave after its decline in popularity, where Seapunk was heavily inspired by many early works within the Silicon Dreams style of aesthetics (due to many members of the community being children at the time Silicon Dreams was first conceived) which added to the sense of nostalgia that both Seapunk and Vaporwave evoke. The music video for Dire Strait's Money for Nothing included early CGI animation in it, as well as Miley Cyrus's music video for We Can't Stop also utilizing clips from the earliest known example of CGI animation (a simple talking face attempting to show emotion and \"talk\" that was made all the way back in 1974).  Many Seapunk music videos (specifically from the likes of Ultrademon) utilize a more \"high definition\" variation of the early Silicon Dreams works of the 1990s. In the late 2010s and 2020s, many Intelligent Drum and Bass/Jungle albums and Low Poly YouTube mixes feature CGI of the Silicon Dreams aesthetic (most notably, the Peshay Studio Set (1996)). Jungle is a more advanced and Y2K Futurism-oriented sound, compared to the more primitive, Late 80s/Early 90s New Age sounds of Vaporwave. Some of the notable Drum and Bass/Jungle artists related to this aesthetic being Inner-Vation, LTJ Bukem, Total Science, and Funky Technicians. In terms of its usage in early media of the 90s, there was a certain level of what could be described as \"janky\" in this particular era of CGI animation, due to the technology still being extremely new and, as such, still in an extremely primitive state. Because CGI was fairly new in video games in the '90s, 3D video games have low-poly graphics, meaning that the meshes in games do not have many polygons to create a smoother model.",

Though named in 2017 following a trend found on sites like Tumblr and Instagram, sizz is in fact a more modern evolution of several older aesthetics - a sort of combination of the German expressionist method of abstraction to build a sense of mood, the emotion created by contrast and lighting in American film noir, and the way the Japanese are-bure-bokeh street photography movement embraces griminess and lack of focus in its snapshots. The term \"sizz\" is intended as onomatopoeia to simulate the sound of noise - according to Merriam-Webster, the word \"sizz\" means \"to hiss or move with a hissing sound.\" Sizz is defined not by a set of specific rules, but by an \"ethos\" - composition is valued over technique, experimentation over purity, and feeling over formula. The community around this aesthetic is centered primarily around appreciating the artists that create such works, so giving credit is considered mandatory. (Most of the information on this page, for example, is taken from this post made by the creator of the aesthetic.)",

Skeuomorphism is the design concept/aesthetic of making items resemble their real-world counterparts. Skeuomorphism is mainly used virtually in user interface (UI) and web design. However, non-virtual, Traditional Skeuomorphism can extend to architecture, ceramics and interior design. Skeuomorphism contrasts with Flat Design, a simpler, less detailed graphic style. The word skeuomorph comes from the Greek words skeuos (meaning “container or tool”), and morphḗ (meaning “shape”)[1]. A skeuomorph (also spelled skiamorph) is a derivative object that retains ornamental design cues (attributes) from structures that were necessary in the original. Skeuomorphs are typically used to make something new feel familiar in an effort to speed understanding and acclimation. It employ elements that, while essential to the original object, serve no pragmatic purpose in the new system. One of the key advantages of Skeuomorphism is that it can help to make digital interfaces feel more natural and intuitive. By mimicking real-world objects and materials,[2] Skeuomorphism can help to reduce the cognitive load on users, making it easier for them to understand how to interact with a digital device. [3] Skeuomorphism is often confused with Frutiger Aero because both aesthetics developed around the same era (c. 2004-2013). Skeuomorphism is applied solely to graphics that resemble reality already, or makes use of realistic textures/elements[2]. Examples of this would be an e-reader's virtual wooden bookshelf or a calendar app that resembles a physical planner. Skeuomorphism often contains glossy, shiny, and depth filled 3D design motifs similar to another aesthetic that was popular at the time, Frutiger Aero. Due to this there is a lot of overlap between the two, people often misinterpreting them as the same aesthetic. However, since glossy elements and 3D depth filled designs are not exclusive to any aesthetic, something that could fall under the \"Frutiger Aero\" umbrella doesn't necessarily have to be Skeuomorphic. Traditional Skeuomorphism refers to any derivative object that retains ornamental design cues (attributes) from structures that were necessary in the original that is outside of the realm of digital designs and aesthetics. Traditional Skeuomorphism isn't a solitary aesthetic in its own right, but rather simply a design style that has existed for hundreds of years. Glassmorphism, known officially as Fluent Design System, is an aesthetic and UI/UX design theme that combines elements of Flat Design with modern design philosophies. It combines depth, motion, and material to create a seamless user experience, while preserving the clean look and feel Flat Design introduced; it shares similarities with both Flat Design and Frutiger Aero. It has been used in UI design since the Mid-2010s, and some notable examples include Microsoft Fluent Design, which was first introduced in 2017 and is now being used in Windows 11, Bing, and Microsoft Edge UI. Android custom UI/UX, mostly Chinese brands, such as EMUI, ColorOS, and MIUI have also been using this since around 2015-2016. Recently, some Linux distros have also been implementing this design; iOS/macOS have been the first using it since 2013.  Glassmorphism/Fluent Design is not a subgenre of Skeuomorphism because they don't have much in common, and breaks the realistic motifs of Skeuomorphism. However, it can be considered an adjacent/heavily related aesthetic. Neumorphism is a subgenre of Glassmorphism as well as Skeuomorphism. Neumorphism, also referred to as Claymorphism, is a design language and Glassmorphism sub-aesthetic that combines elements of Skeuomorphism and Flat Design. It emphasizes soft, rounded shapes, subtle shadows, and gradients. It is often used in UI/UX designs to create a more realistic, natural look and feel. Neumorphism was created in 2019 by independent Figma community designers. Windows 11 and macOS only apply Neumorphism to certain icons but not to their entire UIs[4]. Dark Aero, also known as Mata Nero or Frutiger Ego, is a sub-genre of Frutiger Aero and Skeuomorphism popular from c. 2006-2015. Dark Aero uses a darker color palette contrasting the depth-filled colorful motifs characteristic of Frutiger Aero. This gave the aesthetic a more simplistic look, which lead to it still being used after Frutiger Aero's decline. Another one of Dark Aero's main signature characteristics is aero glass. Dark Aero can be described as the middle ground between Frutiger Aero and Skeuomorphism due to its Frutiger Aero-esque imagery combined with Skeuomorphism's color palette. Whilst Frutiger Aero was more commonly used for mass market and commercial products, Dark Aero focused on high-end and enterprise-oriented items and services. Dark Aero was also commonly used for for modern tech such as smartphones, computers, TVs, cars, etc. Holo, also known as Dark Skeuomorphism, is a device theme and Skeuomorphism sub-aesthetic. It was developed by Google in Android versions three to five (five releases) and it was used from 2011-2015. It was used in Honeycomb (2011), Ice Cream Sandwich (2011), Jelly Bean (2012), KitKat (2013), and Lollipop (2014, to a lesser extent). Holo is a subgenre to and very similar to Skeuomorphism due to it's use of depth, texture, shading, and pseudo-3D imagery that attempts to mimic real world objects. This version of Skeuomorphism, however, is more watered down and flatter. Holo's backgrounds can be described as dark, simplistic yet calming due to its \"cold\" color palette; the most common colors are black, blue, indigo, violet, cyan, and purple. This is normally complimented with see-through abstract patterns or graphical effects. Post-Morphism, Also known as Skeuoflatism[5], Flat Skeuomorphism or alternatively Matte Design, was used during the decline of Skeuomorphism, which marked the transition from saturated realism to a simpler interface design, This design trend was used from 2014-2017. This design trend combines elements of Skeuomorphism and Flat Design. It features a simpler version of Skeuomorphism that doesn't use realistic textures but instead uses a bit of glossy shadows, reflections, subtle gradients and lighting effects.[6] This trend is still being used by several Linux distributions, as well as macOS, iOS, and some Android user interfaces. Post-Morphism is essentially to Skeuomorphism what Frutiger Metro is to Frutiger Aero, both combining elements of Flat Design with their parent-aesthetic. Skeuomorphism has its roots in the field of industrial design, where it has long been used to make new products feel more familiar and comfortable to users. However, in the context of user interface (UI) design, the goal is not just to make digital interfaces feel more familiar, but also to make them more intuitive and easy to use. By drawing on the user's existing knowledge of real-world objects and materials, Skeuomorphism can help to reduce the learning curve and make it easier for users to understand how to interact with a digital device.[3] One of the earliest examples of Skeuomorphism in UI design can be found in the Apple Macintosh 128K. The Macintosh's \"desktop\" metaphor, which used a virtual desktop complete with icons of real-world objects like documents and trash cans, was heavily influenced by Skeuomorphism. Skeuomorphism continued to be a popular approach in UI design throughout the 1990s and 2000s, with many software applications and operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows and Apple's Macintosh, incorporating skeuomorphic elements into their design. For example, iOS's address book app uses a leather-bound book as a metaphor for the address book, and the calendar app uses a physical paper-based calendar. This period (c. 2004-2013) is when Skeuomorphism reached its cultural peak. Skeuomorphism continued to be widely used up until the very early 2010s. After Windows 8 was released in 2012, it was clear that Skeuomorphism was slowly starting to decline in favor of a more flat design, but the release of iOS 7 in 2013 marked the true death of Skeuomorphism in a lot of people’s eyes[7]. The new design that started being used instead became known as Post-Morphism, which is an aesthetic derived from Skeuomorphism mixed with elements of Flat Design. This replacement was likely due to the critics who argued that skeuomorphic design can be confusing and unnecessary, and that it can actually make digital interfaces less efficient and more difficult to use. Instead, many designers have begun to adopt a more minimalistic approach, focusing on simplicity and functionality over realism known as Flat Design. This was the end of Skeuomorphism's popularity, as it was soon completely replaced by Flat Design in most circumstances. In recent years (c. 2021 onwards), Skeuomorphism has started to make a slight comeback in a more modern and minimalist approach. This new style is known as Neumorphism, and was started by independent UI designers in 2019 in an effort to mix Skeuomorphism with minimalism and flat design. This aesthetic went on to be used partially[4] in Windows 11 (along with Glassmorphism) which was released in 2021. Since 2022, Skeuomorphism (along with similar aesthetics from the 2000s such as Frutiger Aero) have started coming into public favour again thanks to social media such as TikTok bringing it into the public eye again. This is mainly due to both nostalgia, and people growing tired of the more recent Flat Design and Corporate Memphis aesthetics (the polar opposite of Skeuomorphism). Many things below fall into this category because they might: use realistic animation techniques (ex: stop-motion, CGI, etc.), depict the life of a realistic object (ex: toys, plushes, dolls, food, etc.), or make use of realistic textures. Some elements were added by other users and could be considered within this category simply because they developed around the same time, which is the early to mid-2010s.",

It is characterized by an aesthetic dominated by slime related pop culture references, ranging from the Toxic Avenger, slime-time live, mountain-dew, and toxic waste. Similar to Vaporwave and Seapunk, this aesthetic is an integral part of the genre and characterizes the artists who dive into the Slimepunk movement. Slimepunk music often times features heavy & distorted bass-lines and has emerged largely from a post-acid scene. Slime-punk artists tend to have a more aggressive or corrosive ethos in combination with their music. While there is no specific slime-punk sound, the aesthetic is a common unifying factor, and most Slimepunk artists feature heavy sampling within their music. Slimepunk was popular among teens and tweens of the internet that was very similar to Seapunk, but with more of a focus on slime. Slimepunk is often accompanied by black and other neon colors. Popular elements of Slimepunk include: Slimepunk fashion often borrows from other aesthetics such as Mall goth and punk, but puts a slimier spin on the two. Neon green and black are often used in slimepunk fashion, as well as protective gear and rave gear. One major aspect of the Slimepunk sound is deep and growling synth \nbasslines, generally with dripping sound effects and/or Acid-House influences. Some of the music approaches Acid-Tech in terms of sound but is distinct in its more atmospheric approach and loyalty to the overall Slimepunk themes of toxic waste and noxious sewer gas. Other Slimepunk music has none of these features but still exists within the movement. Slimepunk is based on aesthetic, and it is that aesthetic that ties all the different sounds together. Slimepunk the musical genre may not exist necessarily, but the movement definitely exists and musical representations of the core Slimepunk aesthetic can definitely be found.",

Sometimes these people are referred to as \"Posh\" but it is important to note that not all posh people are Sloanes. Probably, the most famous example of this subculture was Diana Spencer, before and around the time she married Prince Charles. Another notable example is the TV character Tim Nice-But-Dim, an Old Ardinian. The term is a humorous combination of \"Sloane Square\", a location in Chelsea, London, famed for the wealth of residents and frequenters, and the television character The Lone Ranger.[1] The Sloane Ranger has roots in the English upper classes. Families were peers of the Realm (members of the Royal Family or those with titles presented by the Royal Family) or landed gentry (people who controlled estates and received income from tenants renting land on the estate). Men in these families were members of the House of Lords, who had huge influence on British government and society. During the British colonial era, British aristocrats settled in Australia, Canada, India and the United States. In the United States, they formed the WASP and Preppy subcultures, which can be very similar to the Sloane Ranger aesthetic. In the 1920s, many of the old estates fell into disrepair due to rising costs and the decline of the servant class. Today many old estates are museums and historical sites. Other estates which remain in the family are rented out for movie and television productions, such as Highclare Castle, the setting for Downton Abbey. Despite the \"poverty\" of the aristocracy (relative to their ancestors), an old family name or title gives a Sloane status. Part of the Sloane Ranger aesthetic is a sense of nostalgia for the past, whether it be the 18th century, or the 1920s-1950s. The nostalgia tends to be very patriotic, romanticizing British history and historical figures such as Winston Churchill and members of the Royal Family and ignoring the dark side of British imperialism. Most of the things that Sloanes value are very old. They do not like or trust things which are new, foreign, or French. Places and things associated with the English upper classes. There is some crossover with Dark and Light Academia aesthetics because many Sloanes attend boarding school and later prestigious universities such as Cambridge, Oxford, and St. Andrews. Clothing is generally modest and long lasting. Royal Warrants can be issued to brands which produce high quality goods favored by the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales. Warrants can be revoked if the actions of the company displeases the person who issued it. Rigby & Peller, which provided the Queen's undergarments, had its warrant revoked in 2018. Natural fibers like cotton, wool, and silk are favored. The English insistence on maintaining their traditional dress codes, despite being impractical for the climate of India or the Caribbean, is often mocked in fiction. Makeup is generally natural, with products used to enhance features. The Sloane Ranger handbook describes the look as \"fresh scrubbed.\" Members of the Royal Family are loyal to certain brands. Fashion blogs and magazines report on the styles worn by Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle, which have made them popular among the general public.

Slutcore often is based around the ideals of a typical 'slut' who has sex with anyone they want, particularly female sluts, but it does not aim to shame women or their sexual expression but aims to celebrate it. The terms slut, whore, and bimbo are all reclaimed under this aesthetic by all the brave, strong, and intelligent people who take on this aesthetic as a good thing. Slutcore is not gender specific; men and non-binary people can have similar aesthetics that are sex-positive, but the aesthetic is more popular with women. All people who use this aesthetic have since begun a community that strives to not shame anyone for sexuality, sex actions, etc. Some themes for the sex-positive community include leftist views, sex work positivity, supporting anti-racist portrayals of POC sexuality, and advocating for self-love and confidence. Media usually centers on protagonists who embrace their sexuality and share the values of the aesthetic without being shamed or accepting the shame of others for their lifestyles. As a musical genre, slutcore is categorized as fast-paced electronic pop music accompanied by sexually explicit lyrics. It is almost always made by female artists, as the aesthetic centers around embracing female sexuality.",

Disclaimer: \"By the 2000s, snow bunny began to refer to any attractive woman, regardless of whether or not they were in Aspen. In black slang, snow bunny specifically became a term for a white woman. Bunny, here, continues to draw on its long applications to women, while the color of snow is white. Snow bunny sometimes specifically refers to a mixed-race couple where a black man is with a white woman as well as white women who are attracted to black men.\"[3]",

Snowdrop mainly involves romanticism and wonder in approaching one's reality. It can also involve escapism using one's imagination. Snowdrop isn't solely focused on happiness and tranquility (in fact, it often has very little to do with being truly calm). It involves the ethereal and romanticism in all.

Therefore, the term is only used as a pejorative, kind of like the word Hipster. Most of the time, it represents low effort, poorly-made pixel art that look kitschy and tacky; so alternatively, this aesthetic can also be called \"Trashy Retro\". Anything that can be described as \"So Retro\" may take inspiration from extremely popular games deemed old, such as Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. The aesthetic often includes the MS Paint aesthetic with poorly made drawings in the MS paint program. The aesthetic may have originated from YouTube user mint301 who created a series titled How to Draw Like a Pro With Paint, which included satirical \"tutorial\" videos on how to poorly copy a sprite from a Retro game in Microsoft paint. In 2023, the term \"So Retro\" was coined for the aesthetic and gained popularity as a concept within the YouTube animation community[2]. A gif became popular showing sprites from Mario poorly animated, and became associated with So Retro even though it did not incorporate any poorly made pixel art. The term has been expanded from Pixel Art to refer to games that use the retro Low Poly aesthetic combined with more modern graphical elements which may create an odd feeling, even though this may be an intentional artist choice.

Usually characterized by the decline of technology, abandoned cities full of wildlife. The surviving humans would be focused on food, shelter, and having to work together as a community rather than fighting or having to deal with whichever world ending event may be occurring. Any technology they have might be solar, wind, or other renewable energy sources, but it will be limited. The current political, economic, and ecological climate can inspire feelings of dread, meaninglessness and hatred for this world as it is right now. Soft Apocalypse draws of the desire to abandon this way of living, whether it was voluntary or not, in favour of letting the urban environment decay, leaving forests in its place. Using the feeling of collapse of today's society, the aesthetic focuses on the positivity of the world being a cleaner and almost happier place after the apocalypse. While it can still give a melancholy vibe, there is an underlying feeling of hope that permeates this aesthetic. The visual features of soft apocalypse are very reliant on nature surrounded urban environments. These environments will often include concrete, brutalist architecture, skyscrapers, large buildings and subway stations. They're also very bland in appearance, in comparison to the bright moss, lichen or trees which surround the once urban area. tumblr user otherwindow came up with a zombie apocalypse setting where the zombies were drawn to unhygienic scents and became docile around pleasant ones, resulting in a focus in clean environments for the survivors, and adorning zombies and recently infected with flowers.

Despite calling themselves grunge, followers of the aesthetic were fairly popular in the mainstream and connected to the rise of the Alternative, emo, pop, and indie music and fashion trends of the time, such as galaxy prints, black and white grids, and fandom merchandise. Because of their close-knit community on Tumblr, they developed a \"not-like-other-girls\" attitude, especially in contrast with the \"hipsters\" (which is more accurately described as an early version of VSCO). The type of media they consumed was also incredibly specific, with fangirl culture and this aesthetic often overlapping. This style later declined, yet has gained short-term popularity in 2020 due to a desire to escape to the past.[1] This aesthetic can be described as very fresh or a clean variation of the grunge style. Enthusiasts of this aesthetic focus on taking pictures that contain: The style associated with 2014-era Tumblr has a very defined color palette in that it is typically monochrome or pastel, depending on personal preference. Japanese fashion, early 2000s emo, and more authentic grunge influenced the style, which has outfits that were incredibly specific, almost formulaic. Unlike grunge or the DIY ethos of other alternative fashions, these pieces were typically bought brand new at mall stores such as American Apparel and Hot Topic. Despite the term \"Tumblr girl\" being the most popular term, men can wear the aesthetic too. Soft grunge outfits are now often associated with bisexual people and LGBT fashion.

Solarpunk also emphasizes handcrafted wares (as opposed to mass-produced products) and community. The 'punk' in Solarpunk comes from the genre's anti-authoritarian and anti-capitalist nature, as well as its strong focus on community and prefigurative politics, which separates it from aesthetics like Cyberprep. Solarpunk futurism is not nihilistic like cyberpunk and it avoids steampunk's potentially quasi-reactionary tendencies: it is about ingenuity, generativity, independence, and community. At its core, Solarpunk is a vision of a future that embodies the best of what humanity can achieve: a post-scarcity, post-hierarchy, post-capitalistic world where humanity sees itself as part of nature and clean energy replaces fossil fuels.

        "description": "Southern Gothic\n\n\n\n\n“Later he saw Jesus move from tree to tree in the back of his mind, a wild ragged figure motioning him to turn around and come off into the dark where he might be walking on the water and not know it and then suddenly know it and drown.”― Flannery O'Connor, Wise Blood\n\n\nDecade of origin\n19th Century\n\n\nKey motifs\nCriticism of prejudice, decay, past vs. future\n\n\nRelated aesthetics\nAfter HoursAnglo GothicCatholic HorrorGothGothicAmerican GothicMidwest GothicNew England GothicRegional GothicSouthern BelleSuburban GothicGothTrad GothDeathrockCryptidcore\n\n\nSouthern Gothic is a literary genre encompassing fashion inspired by the culture of the American South. It originated in works by 19th-20th century Southern authors criticizing their society's racism, sexism, classism, fixation on the past, and decaying economy. Later the aesthetic deviated from literature with the \"regional gothic\" trend on tumblr in the mid-2010s, which places greater emphasis on Liminal Space, modern American iconography, evangelicalism, and controversially, hillbilly horror. Because of this, this entry is divided into two sections, with one based on the literary movement and the other on the tumblr revival. A few movies in the 2000s have gone against the harmful tropes revolving around “evil hillbillies and evangelicals in the South”, such as 2010’s Dale and Tucker Vs Evil. This is still a rarity, though, and is definitely a sociological issue that needs to be better addressed. This section is under construction The aesthetic begins in literature which depicts and criticizes the American South. Hence, the general culture of the American South is necessary background. Note that this is not at an academic level and only provides context for the aesthetic. This culture was a slave-society, where the culture is defined by the practice of slavery, with all its aspects being embedded in politics, economics, popular culture, etc[1]. Therefore, there was often a general exposure to cruel punishments used on slaves, anxieties over slave revolts, and the use of grotesque imagery to dehumanize black people. Southern societies also emphasized gentility in families, with wealthy families acting somewhat like European nobility, wherein marriages and blood relations were highly important in capital such as owning slaves and a grand estate[2]. Of course, this lends well to the use of incest, decadence, and domestic violence. Many scholars point to Henry Clay Lewis and Mark Twain as the first to include Gothic tropes in their depiction of the American South. The Tumblr aesthetic began when Tumblr user user clive-gershwin-palmer in January 2015, created a post that is now deleted.[3] Presumably, it follows the same format as other \"Regional Gothic\" posts, where they write about their regional culture in bullet-pointed prose mimicking Welcome to Nightvale, a podcast wherein a fictional radio host nonchalantly describes cults, Eldritch abominations, and cosmic mysteries in their small town in New Mexico. The trend then picked up in March 2015, with user korvidian created a post entitled \"south-east queensland gothic\"[4]. With the popularity of the Regional Gothic trend, people from the American South drew upon bedtime stories, urban legends, and Southern culture in their text posts. The Regional Gothic later developed a visual component, as people uploaded photos of Christian billboards, abandoned churches, and other things in the visuals section. With Southern Gothic in particular, there were many playlists created on the then-popular site 8tracks.com; many creators shared their playlists on tumblr and gained virality. This interpretation of the aesthetic slowly fizzled out, like many other social media aesthetics do.

Her blog strongly resembles older Southern gothic blogs from the mid-2010s, and she also produced new content such as photos from road trips, selfies in her house, and music videos for her songs. This had led to newer users discovering the aesthetic, sometimes erroneously labeled as \"Ethel Caincore.\" The visuals of the literary movement connect with the gothic imagery of decay as a metaphor for the fall of society due to lack of progress. Imagery tended to emphasize the political themes of the work and highlight the differences between the plantation class, poor white people, and black people. Please note, a TVTropes page exists for the aesthetic, as well as it being a genre that is much observed and compiled. Southern Gothic music, also known as Dark Country, describes the umbrella of different genres typically associated with the American South, such as Country, Negro Spirituals, Bluegrass, Gospel, Rock, and Folk. Instrumentation tends to be acoustic, except electric guitar, and either in a slower tempo due to the singers' lower pitch and mournful theme, or in a rapid, scat-like approach to singing that is typically in more rock-like and rebellious songs. The lyrics address the common motifs of Southern Gothic: poverty, religion, drug addiction, the supernatural, and death. They often utilize tropes within novels and folktales, such as making deals with the Devil at the crossroads, witch trials, mothers mourning the death of their children, and becoming a killer. In playlists, there are exceptions, and multiple songs that carry across either an abandoned or a sublime, witch-like sound that do not suggest the American South are also popular. Several Goth bands (ironically mostly in Britain’s Positive-Punk and Australia’s Swampie scenes) employed imagery and musical styles influenced by the dark side of country and rockabilly. One of the clearest musical parallels to Southern Gothic is the Gothic Country subgenre, which was centered in Denver, Colorado and was pioneered by David Eugene Edwards' bands, Sixteen Horsepower and Wovenhand, as well as artists like Slim Cessna and Jay Munly. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPtD2znexvd2eabCPTSCpo-A2r8fvxk5f",

Sovietwave music is often accompained by a Retro-Futuristic aesthetic that focuses on nostalgic topics related to the the Soviet Union, such as the promised utopian communist future that never was, or historical aspects like Soviet space exploration and the Cold War. Sovietwave primarily emerged in the 2010s Russia and other post-Soviet countries to a lesser extent. Emerging in the 2010's among Russian and ex-Soviet internet, Sovietwave is an aesthetic and genre of music drawing upon the phenomenon of Soviet Nostalgia prevalent in certain parts of the former Soviet Union, often, but not limited to, Russia. Sovietwave is characterized by the romanticization of Soviet Utopianism and its vast ambition to unite humanity under the Socialist banner and to take it beyond the stars, untainted by capitalist decadence and hatred. Therefore, Sovietwave features Cosmonauts, Soviet Propaganda replications and other aspects of Soviet Futurism in its artworks and designs. Sovietwave is also notably melancholic, as quite a few music tracks tend to take on an ambient, lo-fi and mysterious style, lamenting the future that never came to pass due to the collapse of the USSR in 1991. Music is more likely to have a slower tempo than traditional Synthwave and New Wave to increase the sense of awe, but is much faster paced than Vaporwave's more dream like tracks. Sovietwave thus ponders on what could have been, a bright future where the workers have taken to the stars rather than be subservient to greed. Considering that many of the adherents to this aesthetic were often born after the dissolution of the USSR or were very young during it, much of the genre also draws on the feeling of nostalgia for a country and its vision that they never lived in, their only experiences with it being the nostalgia of their own parents who were likely Young Pioneer's believing in Marxist-Leninist ideology and philosophy. While not all Sovietwave musicians are ideologically Communist, the aesthetic tends to be sympathetic to Soviet perceptions of the future as well as the music it produced, particularly in the New Wave Era. Sovietwave musicians are therefore occasionally fond of splicing tracks from Communist politicians into their music, whether or not they unironically agree with the sentiments of said politicians. In any case, the genre is consistently fond of replicating Eastern European New Wave music, if not outright remixing classic tracks. Sovietwave is not to be confused with the Vaporwave spin-off of Laborwave despite large degrees of overlap due to shared aesthetics of Communism and anti-capitalism. Laborwave is quite ironic and absurdist in its portrayal of Soviet and general Eastern Bloc nostalgia, while Sovietwave is almost entirely limited to the former USSR and is a more sincere form of nostalgia for the long gone Red Regime. Sovietwave tends to replicate Soviet utopian art earnestly, longing for the future that was promised, and is more fond of expressing awe at the might of the USSR, while Laborwave tends to make fun of such propaganda and grandiose expressions even if Laborwave adherents are unironically pro Communist. Furthermore, Sovietwave originated in the former USSR out of the general Russian internet's electronic Music scene with not all of it adherents being unironic Communists as opposed to Soviet nostalgics, while Laborwave's origins were across the entire internet's and the latter's adherents are more coherently Communist even if not Soviet nostalgic. That said, there can be overlap, and Sovietwave can incorporate Laborwave's Vaporwave elements even though Sovietwave is more interested in grand myth of the USSR as a powerful entity. Sovietwave is closely tied to lo-fi, ambient, new wave and synth-pop.",

It can be expressed both in sympathy for the political system and only in nostalgic memories of the Soviet aesthetics. Soviet nostalgia does not always arise in people who actually lived in the USSR and sympathize with Soviet regime. Including those may be people whose childhood was spent in the \"wild 90s\" in Russia, having had caught the atmosphere of the departing era. One should not perceive Soviet nostalgia as an exclusively social phenomenon caused by an attempt to return the Soviet Union, in a general sense; this nostalgia regards people's memories of childhood in \"Khrushchevkas\", interiors, household items, clothes, works of art, etc. This aesthetic is a reinterpretation by the younger generation of the images of their childhood in the space of signs left over from Soviet times. A lot of visuals in this aesthetic include: Part of the Soviet nostalgia can be considered the aesthetics of the dark Post-Soviet Nostalgia, which covers the period of the USSR collapse and is inspired by the aesthetics of the \"wild 90s\" in Russia. This aesthetic is closely related to the Soviet Brutalism including not only architecture, but also fashion, the mood, and post-processed photos, which are the main themes that are displayed in the art. Dark post-Soviet nostalgia includes: In 2021, the trend “Makeup in the style of a bandit’s wife from the 90s” appeared on TikTok among the Russian-speaking community.

As space is the last frontier, many comparisons were made between it and the Wild West. This led to many products being influenced by the tropes of the stories of this era. Despite this, nothing materialized to give rise to the aesthetic until the 1990s. The most notable product until then being the Star Wars universe with the Mandalorian culture. The first products would come from Japan, with the anime and manga series Trigun, Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop being the ones that would notably define this aesthetic. The second wave of the Space Cowboy aesthetic would give rise to different ideologies and ways of interpreting it. Especially, in subreddits such as r/AnFront and R/Anarcho_Frontierism. Where are the two main ones, the one that maintains the original version of its creator and the one that opts to literally go back to the Wild West. Other notable variants, too, are Fronterismo Hispánico (which claims everything that the ideology proposes for Hispanics is heavily influenced by Pan-Hispanism and the Mexican/Spanish cowboy aesthetic), Frontierism (similar to the original ideology, but with a heavier emphasis on government) the US variants (Alaskan Frontierism and Appalachian Frontierism), Bounty Frontierism and more niche ones, like Christian Anarcho-Frontierism.",

It can also be called astrocore or cosmic core. Spacecore uses lots of stars and planet type things in clothing or decor. Many spacecore aesthetics will have pictures of the sun, the moon or the stars. Spacecore visuals include things such as galaxies, stars, nebulae, planets, moons, and overall pictures of the universe, as well as things like telescopes, space rockets, and traveling along far distances and on foreign planets. Retro and Space-Age influences are popular themes in the Spacecore aesthetic. This is a list of popular visuals in the Spacecore aesthetic: Spacecore fashion incorporates both explicit depictions of space visuals, especially galaxies and local celestial bodies, and less obvious space-inspired style, such as glitter and tulle. Although Spacecore lends itself to formality, it can be integrated into almost any type of clothing, from high fashion to casual to sleepwear. Retro-futurism is popular in Spacecore fashion. This is a list of some popular style choices in the Spacecore aesthetic: Spacecore film mostly consists of futuristic and sci-fi genres. One of the biggest movie franchises Spacecore relates to is the Star Wars series. Thriller and adventure movies also show in Spacecore (Interstellar & Ad Astra). Some Chinese cultivation novels, such as Dragon Talisman, Five Frozen Centuries, Low Dimensional Game, Desolate Era, Stellar Transformations, Lord Xue Ying, and the Ergenverse have characters who can manipulate fictional, superpowered stars or black holes and/or can manipulate outer space to create attacks.

Many significant societal advances were achieved during this era, including literature, painting, sculpture, architecture, intellectualism, music and theater, among many other fields. Generally it features an unique mix of artistic and cultural movements from western Europe, including styles such as Baroque, Renaissance and Mannerism.   This era's influence is not limited to Spain and the Americas: it would affect the history and culture of multiple modern territories, including Portugal, Andorra, Southern Italy and Milan, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Franche-Comte and Charolais (France), Morocco and the Western Sahara, Equatorial Guinea, the Philippines, and multiple other countries due to foreign influence.  \nIts influence can be noted on some 21st century aesthetics, such as New Spanish Catholic Girl, Angelcore, Royalcore or Spainwave. The starting date of the Spanish Golden Age isn't associated with any date in particular, but it surged after the end of the Iberian Reconquista, the discovery of The Americas and the release of the first ever Castilian language (internationally known \"Spanish\") grammar book: Gramática de la lengua castellana (Grammar of the Castilian language). During the Spanish Golden Age, Spain experienced a period of political stability under the Habsburg dynasty. The rule of Charles V and his son Philip II over the country made the Spanish Empire become a global power and influenced many territories, including the newly discovered Americas, Europe and East Asia. This political stability provided the perfect environment to develop new forms of cultural entertainment; poetry, novels, theatre plays, etc. When it comes to art, the Spanish Golden Age is best known for its important appreciation of religious themes, influences by Realism and Naturalism, portraiture, inspiration from mythology, folklore and Spanish history, and adoption of the Baroque style, as the Spanish Golden Age coincided with the Baroque period. Various artists like El Greco, Diego Velázquez, and Francisco de Zurbarán created masterpieces which featured the spiritual themes and intense emotions of the era.  \nThe representation of religion through art was given a lot of importance, with many artworks featuring saints, angels, martyrs and biblical scenes. In those religious-themed paintings, the technique Chiaroscuro was very commonly used; chiaroscuro consists on contrasting light and dark, and it added a dramatical aura to the paintings of this period. The School of Salamanca was perhaps one of the most revelant artistic and intellectual movements during the Spanish Golden Age. They were active from the 16th to 17th centuries and developed new ideas related to the Renaissance and Reformation, and other important topics such as human rights. Although the Salamaca School was more about ideas than art, various members notably engaged with fine arts and aesthetic theories, such as Francisco de Vitoria, who wrote about the relationship between beauty and social morals. He also considered art  a perfect setting to express morality and ethical values. The Seville School of art attracted many artists who developed their own artistic style. Sevilian artists who belonged to this art movement mainly focused on naturalism and delicate details. The artist most associated with this movement is Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, whose works depicted scenes from everyday life, and also incorporated religious topics and spirituality. The School of Cusco was the most influential artistic tradition in the Americas. It was estabilished in Cusco, in modern day Peru, which was part of the Spanish Empire (Viceroyalty of Peru) at the time. It was active during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Although it was estabilished in Peru, it also spreaded to other territories such as the Andes, modern Ecuador and Bolivia. The style was mainly developed by the artist Diego Quispe Tito. The style was exclusivily used to represent Catholic subjects, and it was characterized by its lack of a perspective. The colours used were traditionally bright red, gold and earth colours, and the visuals included distorted, dramatic images. Some common motifs were the use of flora, fauna and golden leaves, mainly in artworks featuring the Virgin Mary, and Warrior angels were also commonly depicted in artworks. The artworks were also inspired by Byzantine, Flemish, and Italian Renacentist Art. Literature was a very important part of the Spanish Golden Age, as it reflected the taste, values and interests of the Spanish society of the time. It rightfully became the most important period of literature in Spain's history, and in fact the Castilian language reached its peak level of expressivity. Some of the most important novels ever were written during this period, such as Don Quixote, which is still subject to studies by modern scholars. Most of the Spanish Golden Age literature is expressed through poetry and various distinct novel genres, with the most important ones being Chivalric novels, Picaresque novels and Exemplary novels. The Chivalric Novel Genre (Spanish: Novela de Caballerías) focused on tales about knights, chivalry, and heroic adventures. The novels focus on characters (who typically fit the knight-errant archetype) who participate on a series of adventures quests and battles, because the protagonist is searching for love, honor or glory. The genre takes a lot of inspiration from Medieval literature and legends. The Chivalric Novel was arguably the most famous genre during the Spanish Golden Age. Due to its heroic and escapist nature, it easily caught the attention of all social classes, and they were read by the nobles, commoners and peasants. Don Quixote or Don Quixote de La Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes is the most well known Chivalric movie. Don Quixote takes place in Castile-La Mancha, where an hidalgo called Alonso Quijano reads so many Chivalric novels that he goes crazy and becomes a knight-errant, and goes on several adventures with his squire Sancho Panza. Don Quixote as been labelled as the world's first modern novel. The Historical Novel Genre (In Spanish: Novela Histórica) refers to Spanish novels that were purely fictional but set in an historical context, especially in Spain's. This genre recreates a modern perspective on the past by mixing real historical events with fictional characters and storylines. This way, the authors/writers tell their perception on what they think the past was like. The Sentimental Novel Genre (Spanish: Novela Sentimental) focused on the emotions, feelings, and personal experiences of the novel's characters. Typically, the stories usually follow the love life, friendships, families and social experiences of the protagonist. One of the most important plays belonging to this genre is Life is a Dream, published in 1635 by Pedro Calderón de la Barca. This story is set in Poland and revolves around Segismundo, a Polish prince who had been imprisoned since he was born. The Mystical Novel Genre (Spanish: Novela Mística) revolves around mystical, religious and spiritual topics. The novels express religious and occult experiences and typically talk about related themes such as divine love, spiritual awakenings, searching for the meaning of life and the fussion between the souls of God and the Believer. The most famous mystical novel is The Life of St. Teresa of Avila, an autobiography written by Teresa of Ávila herself and published in 1565. The Byzantine Romance Novel or Pilgrim Adventure Novel (Spanish: Novela Bizantina or Novela de Adventuras Peregrinas) genre was developed in Spain between the 16th and 17th centuries: it was heavily inspired by the literary trends that were prevalent in the Byzantine Empire, and mimicked Hellenic authors. The genre is characterized by its mysterious plots, romantic themes, adventures and fantasy. The most important Spanish Byzantine Novel is El peregrino en su patria by Lope de Vega, published in 1605. The novel tells the story of Pánfilo and Nise, two characters who were in love and only managed to reach it after going through hard times and adventures. The Spanish Satirical Novel Genre (Spanish: Novela Sátirica) was prevalent from the 16th century to the 19th century. The novels used Burlesque and humoristic elements with the intent to criticize or mock the social, political, and religious institutions of the time, as well as their corruption and the hypocrisy of the Spanish society. Consequently, the genre overtime became really broad and moved onto a lot of social issues and topics, such as politics, religion, gender, and social class. The most well known Satirical novel is The Golden Ass (known as Las metamorfosis in Spanish) by Apuleyo, which although was a found ancient Latin novel from the 170s, gained important attention in Spanish Golden Age literature. The Moorish Novel Genre (Spanish: Novela Morisca) is a literary genre that focuses on the daily lives of the Moorish peoples (an historical term applied to any person of north African or Arab descent living in Europe) that were living in the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages. This genre typically revolves around love, honor, religious conflicts, and cultural identity, as well as the conflicts between the Iberian Christians and the North African Muslims. Because of this, the novels often feature Muslim protagonists who find themselves caught up between their Islamic heritage and the Christian-dominated society they live in. However, they're not meant to accurately reflect the conflicts and rather are poetic interpretations. So basically, this novels represent the harshness of the conflicts between religious and cultural groups during the Middle Ages, but not in a historically accurate way. The first Moorish novel published is El Abencerraje by an anonymous author, published throughout 1561 and 1565. The story narrates the life of a Muslim knight (abencerraje) who falls in love with a Christian woman, and surrounds topics such as love, honor, and religious tolerance. The Picaresque Novel Genre (Spanish: Novela Picaresca) focuses on characters described as Pícaros; a low class marginalized character who lives off wisely exploiting other people in mostly harmless ways. The picaro is usually depicted as an anti-hero, engaging in dishonest or morally questionable behaviours to survive in a corrupt society. As the genre's name suggests, they serve as the protagonists of the novels. It is characterized by its episodic structure, satirical tone, and the adventures of the protagonist. These novels often provide criticism on society, social issues, institutions, and human nature. The most important Picaresque novel is Lazarillo de Tormes by an anonymous author, published in 1554. This specific novel is very popular even to this day, and some people have described it as \"timeless\", since it's easy to relate to it even in modern times. The novel narrates the life of Lazarillo, a young boy who over time becomes the servant of various persons, each representing a specific social class. From his personal experiences, Lazarillo exposes the hypocrisy and corruption of Spanish society at the time. The Spanish Exemplary Novel Genre (Spanish: Novela Ejemplar) surged in the 16th Century. As its name suggests, it preaches didadistic and moral values, and it also focuses on the lives of ordinary people. This genre was popularized by various Spanish writers such as Miguel de Cervantes, Quevedo, and Tirso de Molina, who used satire and humor to criticize society. The most important characteristics of the Spanish Exemplary Novel is its focus on honor, morality, and personal integrity. Exemplary Novels usually incorporate topics such as love, family life, and social classes, to show a realistic point of view on the typical human interactions and social norms of the time. The most well known example of an Exemplary Novel is the Novelas Ejemplares series by Miguel de Cervantes, written from 1590 to 1612 and published in 1613. The Pastoral Novel genre (Spanish: novela pastoril, also called Bucolic or Eclogue) is based around the idealization of the rural world, in particular one where shepherds and shepherdesses live in peace and harmony with nature. The novels' topics are usually about love, beauty, and living a simple rural life. The shepherds and shepherdesses are often in love, but they often face obstacles to reach it. They traditionally use poetic characteristics and lyrical descriptions. La Diana (1559) by Jorge de Montemayor is considered one of the earliest and most influential Pastoral Novels, and La Galatea (1585) by Miguel de Cervantes is possibly the most famous example. La Galatea revolves around the love story of Elicio and Galatea, two young shepherds who face numerous obstacles in their pursuit of happiness. Some character tropes, archetypes and subcultures originating from the Spanish Golden Age literary works include: Spanish Golden Age Architecture is divided into three styles: Plateresque, Herrerian and Churrigueresque (also known as Ultra Baroque). This architectural styles mainly flourished in Madrid, Toledo and Andalusia, as well as in other ex-Spanish colonies. Plateresque Architecture flourished in Spain during the late 15th century and the 16th century, especially in the Spanish city of Salamanca. It was inspired by past trends in Spain such as the Renaissance and Gothic Architecture. This style is characterized by its ornate and eleborate ornaments, for example the monuments' facades are typically adorned with delicate stone carvings, such as reliefs, friezesor moldings. The decorations use traditional and cultural elements such as heraldry, mythological figures & creatures, Christian religious scenes and geometric patterns. Pinnacles, finials, and gargoyles are also quite common. The monuments are usually tall and slender, and they often have multiple levels. The term Plateresco is derivated from the Spanish world plata, meaning silver, because this style traditionally incorporates motifs originating from silversmith techniques. \nPlateresque monuments sometimes also take inspiration and motifs from other existing architectural styles, such as Gothic Architecture, Mudéjar Architecture and Renaissance motifs.  The style started declining in the 16th century, when the newer architectural styles from the Spanish Empire gained more popularity. Churrigueresque Architecture, also called Ultra Baroque, is a highly ornate and elaborate architectural style that was prevalent during the Spanish Golden Age, specially during the 17th century. Some traits of this style include exuberant decorations, intricate and elegant details & ornamentation, and an exaggerated use of curves or counter-curves. Churrigueresque interiors are often lavish and ornate. The ceilings are traditionally decorated with yesería which uses many fancy and detailed motifs and patterns. This style in particular was closely related with the Roman Catholic Church and its cultural influence at the time. As such, this architectural style was mostly reserved for churches, cathedrals and monasteries, among other buildings for Catholic purposes. Its name Churrigueresco comes from the Spanish & Catalan surname Churriguera, which was a family of Baroque architects from Catalonia. As this and its other name Ultra Baroque suggests, it is very  associated with the Baroque period.  In the Spanish ex-territories, this style flourished and evolved into its own modern thing incorporating elements from the local cultures. Some of the most valued  Churrigueresque masterpieces are today located in Mexico. This style also has a revival movement in California, called \"California Churrigueresque\". A well known example of California Churrigueresque is the Casa del Prado theatre in San Diego. Herrerian Architecture was the architectural style developed in Spain during the third and last stage of the Spanish Renaissance movement during the reign of Philip II. Its prevalence continued during the 17th century, however, it eventually became more influenced by Baroque. Herrerian architecture is characterized by its grandeur, symmetry, and use of classical elements, and it is heavily inspired by the Italian Renaissance, Andrea Palladio's works in particular. This style was named after Juan de Herrera, a Spanish architect who helped develop the style itself. This style was encouraged by the Spanish Habsburg dinasty. The term Spanish Neo-Colonial Architecture refers to any monument or type or architecture that takes heavy inspiration from the architectural styles that were prevalent during the Spanish colonial era. This monuments and architectural movements are usually found in places where the Spanish colonialists were present, such as most of The Americas or the former Spanish East Indies, but not necessarily, as this styles have also been practiced in Australia and China. Because of this, Spanish Neo-Colonial Architecture can be divided in multiple styles, such as California Churrigueresque, United States Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, Estilo Misión or Mexico's Neo-Colonial Style, among many multiple other styles that can be found in Florida, Hawaii, Australia, China, Argentina, etc. Some notable architects of the Spanish Golden Age include: Spanish Golden Age Fashion was characterized by its opulence and luxurious style, matching the wealth and power of the Spanish nobility of the time. The use of expensive fabrics like silk, velvet, and satin was common, as well as intricate embroidery, lace, and jewels. Generally, a person's fashion choice often could \"read into\" one's social and laboral status through elaborate clothing and accessories. Religious motifs were also common in the clothing, due to its important influence. Motifs such as rosaries, crosses and images of saints were commonly found, especially in women's dresses, because modesty and purity were seen as fundamental feminine traits. Along with this, Gender roles were a fundamental value of the society, so men wore loose-fitting garments with intricate details, while women wore more restrictive clothing that traditionally represented modesty. Another important key feature of the fashion worn during the Spanish Golden Age were the regional and historical influences. Since Spain was a recently unified country at the time, pretty all the regions had pretty distinct cultural backgrounds (for example; the Castilians, Aragonese, Granadians/Andalusians, Catalans, Basques, Navarrans, Galicians, Asturians, Leonese, Valencians, etc. - All of these regions had their differences due to the fact they were distinct kingdoms before unification), and this obviously contributed to the sense of fashion in Spain during the 16th and 17th century. The north of Spain was stereotypically considered to be more modest, conservative, religious and 'cultured', while the south of Spain was considered romantic and warm. Southern fashion also included north African and Andalusi influences such as Moorish-inspired patterns and colours, reflecting the long standing Muslim heritage of the south.

Mostly, the works in spy fiction focus on agents employed by the government to retrieve stolen information and objects, discover double-crossers, or end world-ending machines from nefarious villains. The blueprint for most fictional work involving spies comes from Ian Fleming's James Bond series, which glamorized the life of spies; in fiction, these secret agents tend to be highly trained in a variety of stunts and visit exotic and luxurious locales while being hindered by incredibly sophisticated technology and seductive characters. However, the reality of spies is entirely different from the portrayal in fiction, with their activities being more mundane. There is a spectrum in Spy Fiction from being completely fantastical and even campy to dark and gritty. The commonalities between both is the emphasis on the agent being able to escape dangerous situations, the use of action and disguise, and an organization existing to give orders to the agent. Spy fiction tends to be written by white men. Because of this, female characters are often subject to sexist treatment, or are placed in non-consensual sexual situations. Characters of color, when they appear at all, are subject to slurs and stereotyping. Extreme violence such as interrogation torture and gun violence is common in spy fiction. The oldest spy story can be found in the Book of Joshua in the Hebrew Bible. Spy fiction is generally associated with the World War Two and Cold War eras, but spying and secret agents have existed during many wars as well as in times of peace. After the Cold War, the discovery of espionage training programs led to the appearance of spy schools in fiction. Spy fiction in the 1960s could be extremely serious, reflecting the fears of the public during the Cold War era, or it could be humorous and lighthearted, in an attempt to push back against these fears. Humorous spy fiction often parodies more serious spy fiction with references to characters and titles which existed previously. In the late 20th century, spy fiction began to be marked to children. Children's spy fiction is often more easy-going and focuses a lot less on the violence and/or sexual content common in spy fiction created for adults. Additionally, \"The Spy\" often has a \"backup team\", often containing a getaway driver, a tech guy, and a sniper, e.g. Benji and Luther acting as Ethan Hunt's backup team in the Mission: Impossible films. Spies have a large variety of skills which they can be called upon to use during missions. Many of these are associated with the lifestyles and aesthetic of the wealthy. Much of the clothing associated with Spy Fiction is inspired by spy movies from the 1960s, when characters wore black turtlenecks and tan trench coats. A trench coat and fedora hat is often used to symbolize a spy's disguise, although this outfit is so out of fashion in today's world that it would be a completely ineffective one. Spies often desire to blend in with their surroundings as opposed to standing out. Most spy stories involve \"The Spy\" infiltrating a fancy event (e.g. ball) and therefore most spies will have a specific disguise for events like this. Spies are usually required to do \"field work\" which can hugely vary location-wise, from busy city centres, to arctic tundras, to hot desert valleys. Garments that have mission capability/durability etc are used by agents and operatives. Colors, usually militaresque like black, gray, tan, brown, navy and green are typically worn, as well as camouflage (the latter not as a uniform but for concealment/deception only). Layers are worn to regulate body temperature/ease of disguise/interface of garments, and footwear that are easy to run, jump, and climb in. Blouson jackets are typically worn, centralizing important EDC items to the wearer and allowing ease of swift movement. Music in spy fiction covers nearly every musical genre (e.g. the James Bond films will have dramatic pop and classical music, whereas Spies in Disguise will have lighthearted and happy pop music). If the spy fiction is set during a historical time period, popular music from the day is used.",

Many of the pictures are extremely disturbing, featuring deformed animals, deformed or strange eyes, teeth, blood, and animals growling or attacking each other.

Steampunk fiction often explores the anachronistic idea of what would have happened if society built upon steam as a primary energy source and maintained the Victorian visual style. Steampunk engineering often includes visible gears and screws, as well as analog clocks, steam-powered machines (including vehicles such as airships that often carry flying wooden ships), rotating propellers and dials. Those are always made of metals, wood, or even glass, but never plastics or other modern materials. Steampunk fashion often includes Victorian-style clothing, such as suits, waistcoats, top hats and long dresses. Lace, leather and brass are common materials. Accessories are also important to steampunk; popular ones include brass/copper jewelry, pocket watches, and goggles. One of the defining features of steampunk is its use of technology and machinery. Steampunk jewelry often incorporates gears, cogs, and other mechanical elements that are inspired by the technology of the Victorian era. These elements are often used as decorative accents on jewelry pieces, and can give the jewelry a unique and industrial look[1]. Popular motifs include cogs, clocks, and sea creatures (particularly octopodes). Steampunk is popular in cosplay, but it can also be expressed more casually.[2][3] A lot of Steampunk is, much like its futuristic counterpart Cyberpunk, rooted in literary traditions, especially among the works of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells.  While it doesn't exactly share the nihilistic worldview often seen in Cyberpunk (opting instead for a more romantic worldview), it does share the rebellious spirit Cyberpunk has instilled in its aesthetic DNA. Thomas Dolby is arguably one of the originators of the modern Steampunk scene, particularly in his first album The Golden Age of Wireless and his subsequent music videos for “She Blinded Me With Science”, “Radio Silence”, and “Europa and the Pirate Twins”. Over the course of their lengthy career, the music of Canadian progressive rock band Rush fused a variety of aesthetics, along with several musical genres, into their overall soundscape. Towards the end of the band’s career, drummer and lyricist Neil Peart collaborated with science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson to produce the novels “Clockwork Angels,” “Clockwork Lives,” and “Clockwork Destiny.” This trilogy, and subsequent graphic novels, vividly conjures the Steampunk aesthetic which is further enhanced by artists Hugh Syme and Nick Robles. The following Rush albums are companions to the novels: Other notable artists: Teslapunk is a subgenre of speculative fiction which is similar to steampunk, named for scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla, and refers to fictional narratives or visual styles inspired by 18th, 19th, and early 20th century pioneers of electricity and electrical devices. This narrative or style commonly imagines an alternate history where widely available cheap (or free), clean, and often highly portable electrical energy replaces all previous energy sources (such as wood, coal and oil, and the steam engines that were fuelled by them), but has yet to be replaced (or is never replaced) by other energy sources itself (such as diesel or nuclear power).

While it always has existed in some form or another as part of the larger Goth subculture, it wasn't until the mid-2010s that it was given an own name that is derived from the latin word for witch \"Stregeria\". As the name suggests, the aesthetic draws inspiration from the existing witch community, particularly those who are also part of the Goth subculture. The Goth subculture always embraced witch-inspired style but also has recently gained recognition outside of the scene. While Strega fashion is influenced by the witch culture, its roots trace back to the dark variant of the Japanese Mori Kei style. The major purveyor of this in the 80s, both lyrically and visually, was Siouxsie and the Banshees, who moved from grotesque Steven King fare to the more mystical and dream-like in songs like “Spellbound”, “Red Over White”, and “Green Fingers”. (Even going so far as to filming their own version of Alice in Wonderland.) Meanwhile, Bauhaus wrote the song “Hollow Hills” in reference to Brian Froud and Alan Lee’s Faeries. The album covers and music videos of 4AD’s This Mortal Coil featured ethereal, often forested imagery. Danielle Dax potrayed Wolf Girl in The Company of Wolves, based on Angela Carter’s The Bloody Chamber. The literary influences came full circle as the fey side of the Goth scene began to influence the fantasy, fairy tale retellings, and urban fantasy of the day. In art, Brian Froud adopted gothic visuals for the movie Labyrinth. In books, Terri Windling’s Borderland anthologies and Emma Bull’s War For the Oaks were overtly a hybrid of fae mythology with proto-Goth imagery. The influence of this then-nameless movement-within-a-movement has persisted in literary, artistic, and musical works up into the modern era and on social media. Styles used by certain Strega-type bands helped to originate 90s Hippie Goth and Romantic Goth. But while Hippie Goth is often just boho clothes with dark colors and makeup, Strega tends towards Pre-Raphaelite influences and color schemes as well as the distinctive use of brocade, velvet, and glitter. The Strega aesthetic tends to feature darkly dream-like, sometimes natural imagery, such as: While Strega fashion is similar to Mori Kei in that it features natural, layered clothing, it also adopts a color scheme of black, dark gray, browns, and earth tones, distinguishing itself from the typically off-white hues of Mori Kei. It also may incorporate earthy greens, brick reds, and rich violets while staying true to its Goth roots. Strega typically incorporates symbolic elements such as pentacles, long dresses, and gender-neutral clothing, reflecting the word's gender neutrality. The style often features loose clothing, reminiscent of medival forest wear, a nod to the daily activities of witches practicing their magick. With layered garments and high boots, the outfits not only exude a mystical vibe but also offer practical protection. The prevalent use of black in Strega fashion stems from its symbolic association with protection in the witch community. To make the overall appearance more mysterious, mufflers and overcoats are often incorporated into Strega fashion. They not only contribute to the aesthetic but also serve practical purposes, helping in discreet exits from unwanted situations—a seemingly ideal ensemble for introverts—and, of course, providing an extra layer of protection from harm. Strega also heavily rellies on symbolism associated with witchcraft such as pentagrams, antlers, and crow feathers. There's also many outfits that embrace a bohemian aesthetic inspired by traveling witches. If you aim to create a look based on a specific type of witch that actually exists among practicers in real life it is recommend to do proper research in order to ensure accuracy and alignment with the desired aesthetic. It has inspired much of 80s era fantasy and urban fantasy, but in general it lends itself to shadowed, ethereal atmospheres. Dark Victorian fairy paintings, jewel tone color schemes, Pre-Raphaelite art, shimmery forests, ballroom/masquerades, and classic ballet/modern dance imagery tend to fit. These are a few that influenced certain imagery (but were not inspired by this aesthetic, as they predated it). Bohemian Manifesto: A Field Guide to Living On the Edge by Lauren Stover discusses Fairy Goth, which is extremely similar to Strega. As this is a Goth subgenre, Goth music and bands are associated, particularly those that explore folkloric subject matter. The vocalists are typically unusual, banshee-esque, and even operatic in their range. It’s also common to see folk rock influences. Ethereal wave is by far the most dominant Goth genre to find this aesthetic in, particularly from the mid-80s 4AD (and later, Sam Rosenthal’s Projekt) indie record label. Much of the artwork and photographs for the 4AD bands was done by Vaughan Oliver and Nigel Grierson, who created darkly ethereal, abstract album covers and videos. This perfectly mirrors the otherworldly soundscapes of Cocteau Twins and This Mortal Coil. Albums such as Cocteau Twins' Treasure, Siouxsie and the Banshees' A Kiss in the Dreamhouse, and All About Eve’s self-titled debut are particularly important. Similar to Dark Fairycore, but more centered on cosplay and Renaissance festivals. It has been labeled as connected to ethereal wave, but actually has more in common with non-Goth neoclassical darkwave artists such as Priscilla Hernandez and The Changelings. They typically wear full-on dark fairy costumes, complete with wings and dramatic eyeliner, and tend to be fans of the work of Brian and Wendy Froud. Typically used to describe the styles worn by 4AD 80s ethereal wave bands such as Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance. They typically wore long-skirted dresses (either all-black or all-white), pearls, pink eyeshadow, and white tights. They were often surrounded by abstract, dream-like imagery, usually the photos of Nigel Grierson. (Main Wiki discusses this on the Ethereal Wave page.)

It is based around the idea of strip clubs and glow in the dark undergarments. The aesthetic glorifies the neon signage and back alley advertisements, as well as the glamorous interiors of these sorts of establishments. This aesthetic is often associated with a wide variety of musical styles, but in the modern era, Rap, R&B, Hip-Hop and Trap are most commonly associated with this aesthetic. Because of the color palettes and similar motifs, Stripcore shares a lot in common with Synthwave, Vaporwave, and Glowwave, but with more of an adult spin than some of the aesthetics already feature. Stripcore is often based around the general contrast of neon lights on black or strip club backgrounds. Bright neon colors (such as: neon yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, and blue) commonly found on large strip club fronts are a noticeable aspect of Stripcore, as well as the back alley advertisement. Neon glowing glass usually found in strip club interiors is also a notable aspect of Stripcore. Items in the visual aspects of the Stripcore aesthetic can include: The Stripcore aesthetic may also include women performing within a strip club; something we will not be able to show on this Wiki for very obvious reasons. As far as after hours go, the Stripcore aesthetic may have unfortunate crossovers into Drugcore territory (though it should be noted that this won't ALWAYS be the case with Stripcore; a lot of these ladies do like to keep it clean, after all, and are just doing their job). Stripcore fashion is incredibly skimpy and can borrow heavily from the Raver aesthetic (especially with the Raver festival wear that they'll often wear to outdoor festivals). In terms of make-up, a lot of Glowwave or even Chroma Chameleon can show up due to their inherently flashy and eye-catching nature, and what better way to catch the eye of customers than with flashy, eye-catching make-up and clothing. Stripcore items include: Stripcore music is designed with one goal in mind; to replicate the vibe within a strip club. Sometimes the music is about the boys going out to the strip club to spend lots of money on the girls or are sometimes just a glorification of strippers as a whole.",

The visual appeal applies to small business owners as well but may be out of personal preference rather than for profit, however, this aesthetic can be taken advantage of for monetary purposes by anyone. Studyblr users usually use stylistic writing, cursive, and calligraphy for aesthetically pleasing notes. Headings and subheadings are bolder and more stylized, while the rest is more casual, but not sloppy or messy. Bullet points, numbering, highlighting, boxing, indenting, color coding and other methods are used to organize notes. Doodles, arrows, banners and other manners of stylization are usually used as well.

Common motifs include coming-of-age, familial/generational trauma, facades, and the shallowness of capitalistic culture. The motifs and photographs are American-centric, with parodies and dark interpretations of the 1950s nuclear family and 1980s economic boom. Those characters and locations tend to have a dark secret, such as drug addiction or infidelity, to emphasize the darker nature of the restrictiveness of social norms. Much of the modernization of this aesthetic has been defined by the director David Lynch (hence the term “Lynchian” used to describe much of Suburban Gothic’s attributes). It’s important to note that while Lynch is a purveyor of Surrealism and the supernatural, not all of Suburban Gothic is surreal by nature. Some is even realistic, although still highly stylized. While sharing similar traits with Southern Gothic and Midwest Gothic, there is no specific region or nation that appears prominently in suburban gothic. The aesthetic has its origins in literature, film, and television, but later gained a visual aesthetic and more examples through short bullet-pointed lists with the regional gothic trend on Tumblr in the mid-2010s. In this version, there is a heavy emphasis on the use of Liminal Space, supernatural beings, and tropes typically found in suburban culture, such as housewives and cheerleaders. For more, see the TVTropes page. There is no specific music genre, but due to the heavy influence of David Lynch on this aesthetic, ethereal wave, dream pop, and dark ambient have a heightened importance and influence. This seems to be done to contrast the morbidity of the subject matter. Dark Jazz also tends to be used in this genre. This is because Suburban Gothic has a tendency towards using old jazz or doo-wop staples, particularly if they’re made melancholy and ethereal (once again, highly similar to dream pop). A few early Hardcore Punk, Post-Punk, Goth, and Deathrock bands embraced a similar aesthetic at times (ie Siouxsie and The Banshee’s “Happy House”). This is well displayed in the 1983 movie Suburbia.",

Sukeban (スケバン) is a former Japanese subculture as well as the name of a fashion style derived from the looks of rebellious girl gangs. It first emerged during the 1960s as a form of rebellion against societal gender norms that expect women to always behave and dress well-mannered, causing a rise of deliquent girls enganging in anti-social and violent behaviour as a form of feminism.[1] Older sukeban were often also members of bosozoku biker gangs. The popularization of the word Sukeban is largely due to movies, TV shows, and manga in the 1970s and 1980s. There are multiple theories for the meaning of the term, but the most common is that it is a portmanteau of \"Suke\" (slang for girl in Japanese) and \"Banchō\" (boss of a delinquent gang) forming \"Sukeban\" which makes it roughly translate to \"girl boss\". \nThe word \"Sukeban\" originated from Norifumi Suzuki's \"女番長ブルース 牝蜂の逆襲\" (On'na Banchō Series: Queen Bee Strikes Again), which had \"スケバン\" (Sukeban) written underneath the On'na Banchō part (as Ruby characters, a way to give an alternate reading of words in Japanese). As most members of girl gangs are still school age, they still have to wear school uniforms most of the time which are modified to show off their signature styles: blouses are cropped to expose the bare waist, skirt length is increased, and loafers are replaced by sneakers. Another key feature is the long customized coats (特攻服) which feature feminist symbology and anarchic messages in kanji. Sukeban TV shows were popular during the 1980s. They almost always featured the sterotypical depiction of a sukeban character wearing a blue sailor suit with a long skirt. They featured action and fighting and were usually based around the sukeban characters having powerful abilities or tools. A notable example of sukeban in fiction is Saki Nikaido from Zombieland Saga. She was a biker gang leader who originates from the 90s, and both her normal outfit and her first performance outfit are examples of the sukeban style. The character of Sailor Jupiter from the Sailor Moon franchise was originally written as being a part of this subculture, but it was quickly dropped, though she does retain some elements, especially in her hairstyle and school uniform. Shenmue takes place in the town of Yokasuka, Japan and features a sukeban gang with characters, including the leader  Yumiko Minamino. The sukeban wear schoolgirl outfits with skirts modified to be very long and colorful eye makeup. Their activites include squatting in alleyways, hanging out with the Yankis, using rods and razor blades as weapons, insulting the player's character, and recruiting girls to their gang.

He helped other artists to put Japan on the art world map and bridge the gap between fine art and commercial aesthetics, basically Japan's answer to Neo-Pop art. The visuals of Superflat Pop are inspired by traditional Japanese paintings and their country's cultural elements, being a modern take of Japanese art as a whole.

It was founded by Kazimir Malevich in Russia, and announced in Malevich's 1915 Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings 0.10, in St. Petersburg, where he, alongside 13 other artists, exhibited 36 works in a similar style. The term suprematism refers to an abstract art based upon \"the supremacy of pure artistic feeling\" rather than on visual depiction of objects. Suprematism does not embrace a humanist philosophy which places man at the center of the universe. Rather, Suprematism envisions man—the artist—as both originator and transmitter of what for Malevich is the world's only true reality—that of absolute non-objectivity.",

Artists painted unnerving, illogical scenes, sometimes with photographic precision, creating strange creatures from everyday objects, and developing painting techniques that allowed the unconscious to express itself. Its aim was, according to Breton, to \"resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality\", or surreality. Surrealism rejected any rational version of life, and favored a vision that was influenced by dreams and the unconscious mind. Some surrealists would draw or write without paying much attention to what they were creating, while others sought to depict their dream worlds.[1] Surrealism began as a literary movement in Nantes, Brittany in the late 1910s and early 1920s that experimented with a new way of expression. André Breton, the creator of Surrealism, published the Manifesto of Surrealism in Paris in 1924, which was officially consecrated. https://www.theartstory.org/movement/surrealism/",

The visuals commonly associated with Vaporwave are derived from Neon Noir. While it does often get lumped in with Vaporwave, there are significant differences between the two genres. The genre is credited as being started by acts such as College, Kavinsky, and FM Attack The music strongly shares some key traits within the French House/Italo Disco musical genres.  The true proto-Synthwave acts came from musical scores of films in the 1980s created by the likes of John Carpenter (Halloween, The Thing, They Live, etc.), Vangelis (Blade Runner), and Tangerine Dream (Firestarter). While the genre has started to dip in popularity slightly, there is still a very devoted following and a lot of musicians still sell decently. The visuals associated with Synthwave draw a lot of inspiration from graphics often seen during the '80s, such as sunset graphics, neon grids, neon lights, '80s sports cars, wireframe vector graphics, pixel art that is designed to look like an old school 8-bit video game, video cassettes, arcades, malls, etc. This visual style is often called Outrun. Some people will confuse the visuals of Synthwave with the ones from the Vaporwave genre, but there are key differences in not only what is used in the art of the respective aesthetics, but also the tone of it: while Vaporwave can tend to have a more tongue-in-cheek and sarcastic tone to it, Synthwave is incredibly earnest with its love of everything 80s and is made in tribute to the era rather than critiquing it. Despite this, however, it's not uncommon for artists from the two scenes to collaborate to make art or music (one noteworthy example includes Synthwave artist Bart Graft collaborating with Vaporwave/Future Funk artist Bubble Keiki to produce the album, Emerald. Synthwave music sounds like the natural progression of the 1980s film score sounds although some artists will take inspiration from the Synthpop music that was popular then. Some Synthwave music seems to be moving away from the 1980s and moving more into the 1990s, thanks to tracks like \"America Online\" by The Midnight. Some Synthwave artists include: Chillsynth is a form of Synthwave music that utilizes elements from Chillwave, namely lush and dreamy synthesizers with reverb and resonance, resulting in a dreamy and relaxed sound. Chillsynth is characterized by slow, mild tempos and percussion, foregoing the dark and nocturnal sound of other synthwave styles like Darksynth for dreamy, hypnagogic, soothing and sometimes lo-fi atmospheres, for which it is sometimes referred to as \"lo-fi synthwave.\" In contrast to most other synthwave, which usually pays homage to the 1980s, chillsynth is less direct with its nostalgic elements and often references the 1990s instead, like many chillwave styles. Chillsynth is similarly distinct from chillwave in its synth-heavy and futuristic sound, in contrast with chillwave styles that feature more organic instrumentation and/or dominant Pop elements. Chillsynth occasionally incorporates influences from Vaporwave and other related Vapor styles, both musically and visually. Chipwave is a term for music that combines Synthwave with 8 bit Chiptune synthesizers. They often use a video game focus for the artwork, videos, and track inspirations. Some are musical covers from 80's video games and are collected in several key compilations. Chipwave artists sometimes combines Synthwave and Chiptune with other genres and styles to create even more diverse hybrids. As its name suggests, the Darksynth concerns the darker and heavier side of Synthwave, Darksynth emerged in the early 2010s as Synthwave artists incorporated atmospheric Horror Synth and fast tempos into a much heavier and darker style. Music videos and album artwork moved away from synthwave's 1980s aesthetics and embraced ultra-violent horror, action, and satanic imagery. The genre received significant attention from the critically acclaimed soundtracks for the video games Hotline Miami and Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number. Both soundtracks featured many darksynth pioneers such as Perturbator, Carpenter Brut, Mega Drive, and Gost. Freshwave (or Retro R&B) is small style of Synthwave that focuses on the larger urban style of 80's Pop and R&B radio stations. That music included Hip-Hop, Old School Electro, Synthfunk, Boogie, and Freestyle blasted from boomboxes in major cities. Only a handful of artists have made albums that have taken this diverse direction and they represent a key part of the past that has been otherwise ignored in the modern Synthwave scene. The Horror Synth Revival of the late 2000's was mostly influenced by classic horror musicians of the 70's, with the Italian Horror style of progressive rock bands like Goblin and Fabio Frizzi, but also John Carpenter 80's synth soundtracks. This style, often incorporating progressive electronic, predated the full impact of 80's inspired Synthwave music that was to come and take part. This was a faithful revival of the Italian and American Horror sound of the 70's and early 80's and looking to reproduce faithful new work from these old influences. Outrun combines synthwave with the feeling of driving. The name originated from the game \"OutRun\" by Sega, which was based around simply driving without a care while listening to music. Thus, the aesthetic is heavily based around cars from the 80s such as the Ferrari Testarossa Spider.[1] Outrun was also combined with Neon Noir movies such as Drive, where the synthwave was used to enhance the loneliness. Retrowave refers to a specific type of synthwave where artists recreate the 80s when synthwave was most popular. It heavily utilizes Retro-Futurism by adopting the optimistic and neon-filled vision of the future prevalent at the time.[2] Sexwave is a very niche style of Synthwave that goes beyond just romantic sounding synthwave and focuses more on the erotic. Many of the thumbnails for videos select pics from 80's photos and adult magazines for clickbate. Some of the fan-made videos incorporate R rated movie footage from the 80's as well. Many of these synthwave producers fit their music to match; incorporating italo disco, darksynth, synthfunk, and dreamwave among others. Certain youtube channels and artists embrace this style more than others and many producers still only create a handful of such described tracks. Spacewave is a very small part of the synthwave community (and rarely officially called that). It focuses on futuristic, science fiction-based themes of planetary exploration in both the visual aesthetic and also in the spacey sounding music and track titles. There's several musicians on the Aphasia Records label and elsewhere that are the innovators of this particular style. Sweatwave is a relatively small style of Synthwave. It's aesthetic often features muscle bound hunks, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger's early body building videos, and sleek ladies from aerobic workout videos. Ideally the music is upbeat, features heavy use of guitars, often a few vocal samples, and is perfect vintage 80's styled workout music.  The release of 3 key Sweatwave compilations in 2015 really helped solidify the concept during the synthwave boom and a plethora of vhs based seedy films, aerobic videos, and vintage found footage has helped make videos accompanying many of these tracks.

It is highly popular within the Airsoft community, and there are also many people who use it as a form of cosplay. There are also many anime style illustrations and games applying the Tacticool aesthetic to the outfits of female characters to make them appear more \"dangerous\" despite their cute appearance. The negative use of the term originated in a thread on 4Chan's weapons board /k/, where posters use the term to describe superfluous accessories added to weapons. Over the years, the term has started to be used unironically as a positive term by those into that kind of aesthetic.[1] The aesthetic is generally looked down upon, similar to Mall Ninjas, because they are often internet tough guys who collect weapons and claim being badass and skilled in weaponry, but they do so in a \"cringy\" way and are unable to back up their claims. Many people who are in weaponry communities point out how the quality is not up to par with real military gear and is often impractical if they were to actually use these weapons. In addition to the products themselves, this community in a sense \"cosplays\" being in the military through making posts on the internet about their ability to fight, hoarding weapons, and enjoying media that is about contemporary warfare, such as the ''Call of Duty'' video game franchise. The aesthetic is also associated with overly militaristic people in the United States, including people who open-carry and/or are involved with conservative/libertarian paramilitary groups. The weapons that are considered Tacticool may be outfitted with accessories that would not make sense in a real-life context. For example, a scope that is supposed to be for a sniper rifle attached to a handgun, which wouldn’t be able to shoot from long distances. People in the Tacticool community also have this impracticality in camouflage being a common pattern on a variety of merchandise, such as their shirts, home wares, etc. Like the issue with impractical accessories, enjoyers of Tacticool often wear camouflage in areas where they would not be camouflaged, such as in suburbs. In line with it's military roots, Tacticool fashion is equally centered around military gear, but it's influence is more on what is worn by special forces units than \"regular\" military. This includes tight-fitting combat shirts and pants, baggy hardshell jackets, plate carrier vests, or low-cut combat shoes. While Tacticool has been rooted in the military aesthetic, recent trends have shown the Tacticool aesthetic being injected with more paramilitary influences. Key elements to this includes the mixing of ordinary \"civilian\" clothing, most prominently jeans and flannel or plaid shirts; general reduction in camouflage wear or utilizing \"vintage\" camouflage patterns; and usage of non-military issue tactical paraphernalia such as tactical hoodies. Overseas, prominent variations of the tacticool aesthetic are that of the battle maid and armed schoolgirl, which essentially overlays tactical gear such as vests and kneepads over their respective uniforms. Though, in the latter case it is often with the Japanese style of uniforms. This section describes the media that people into Tacticool interact with, rather than there being this type of aesthetic within the media.

It is heavily influenced by Argentine culture, where it originated. However, the aesthetic also includes influences from African and European cultures, which greatly influenced the development and popularity of Tango, respectively. Although Tango is primarily a music-based aesthetic, visuals play an important part. The most common visuals are those related to the dance. For example, photographs or paintings of people doing the tango might be used. These visuals can be more literal, showing images of real people doing the dance, or they can be more abstract, using the colors and general shapes of dancers to express the aesthetic (examples can be found in the gallery below). Aside from images of dancing, common tango visuals include: Though the exact origin of Tango is still debated, it is generally thought that the genre came into being in its current form in the late 19th century. The dance is said to have originated in the ports and lower-class areas of Buenos Aires and Montevideo, created by the mixing of cultures from lower-class European immigrants and formerly enslaved African peoples. This first generation of tango performers in Buenos Aires is commonly known as La Guardia Vieja or “The Old Guard”. In the early 1900s-1910s, Tango began to spread internationally. Orchestras and dancers from Argentina began to do traveling performances, mostly in Europe. Almost immediately, the genre exploded in popularity, due in part to the culture shock and taboo surrounding the genre, which is generally viewed as passionate and even sexual in nature. The “European tango craze” took place across many of Europe’s major cities, including Paris, London and Berlin, as well as in New York. The third stage of Tango’s development took place in the Late 1930s. The popularity of the genre had experienced a major dip in the past decade and a half, due in part to the onset of the Great Depression. Additionally, by the 20s, many places in Europe had banned the performance of the tango for being “too sexual” in nature. However, it quickly came back into style under the first Perón government. Although Juan Perón is a somewhat controversial figure in Argentina’s history, he was extremely influential in shaping the culture of Argentina. Under his government, the idea is a unique, independent Argentine culture was developed, which included tango. Many of the most famous tango singers rose to prominence during this time, including Carlos Gardel, Roberto Goyeneche and Tita Merello. This was also the Golden Age of Argentine Cinema, and as a result many tango performers were boosted in popularity due to their roles in famous films. While tango is generally associated with traditional gender roles, with a man as the leader and a woman as the follower. However, starting as early as the very beginning of Tango, there has been a “queer tango” movement in which men would dance with men or women with women. Despite the name, people who participate in open-role tango are not always a part of the LGBTQ+ community - rather, this form of dance exists simply to challenge gender roles, or even just because there are an uneven number of men and women in a performance. In its original form, tango was almost always performed between two men simply because of a shortage of women. However, once tango got popular in Europe, same-sex tango dancing was banned in many places. In recent years, this form of tango has become popular once more, especially in Germany and Argentina. Historical examples of open-role tango can be seen in the gallery below. Traditional tango is a style of music played in 2/4 or 4/4 time. When played by a full ensemble or Orquesta Típica, the orchestra will include two or more violins, a flute, a piano, a double bass and at least two bandoneóns, and occasionally a guitar or clarinet. This group may also include a singer. However, it is just as common to see tango being performed by a single guitar or bandoneón. The bandoneón is an instrument similar to an accordion (pictured right), and an integral part of tango music. Since the development of tango, many sub genres have sprung up. Examples of classic tango musicians, as well as some of its sub genres are listed below.",

It focuses primarily on the contemporary advancement of analog-digital conversion with an underground or industrial background, taking place in real life and spanning primarily from 1970 to 2012. Themes present in Technocore primarily consist of a combination of analog technology and digital technology, with the former representing disconnection and ignorance whilst the latter offers a false sense of reality. This transition entails abandoning old customs (which required mental and physical efforts more complex than current customs) for comforts found in the digital world, which encompasses a vast array of devices and the internet itself: a world larger than we know, and like our own oceans, unknown and mysterious on many occasions; a preamble to transhumanism. There are many variants of this style of aesthetics in question, such as the case of Cyberpunk, a fictional genre where the digital world has won over the analog, or its antonym, Steampunk, where the analog has won over the digital, etc. Other examples can be the Gaslamp genre. Some cultivation novels focus on \"magical\" technology that is neither digital nor analog in nature, but mental, chi-based, magic-based, or something that exists as a property of a higher, non-existent reality in nature; for example, Heavens are Infinite novels can have the same elements.",

Technozen is an aesthetic primarily inspired by the aesthetics of Mid/Late-2000s Japanese technology. It can be described as cold, sterile, and professional looking, and at the same time, cozy, friendly, and cute. It is the Japanese counterpart of Frutiger Aero and it is described as a sub-aesthetic of it; however, Technozen is largely evocative of Asian design while Frutiger Aero is more global. Technozen was also popular in the realm of music, examples including the Wii Main Menu Music (2006) and Golden Sky by Jan Cyrka (2008) featured in the \"A Day Made of Glass\" videos. Visual inspiration originates from a wide variety of sources, Mid/Late-2000s Japanese (and some Korean technology) being a major inspiration. Examples of Technozen technology include the Nintendo Wii, Honda Asimo, Sony Aibo, Toyota bB/Scion xB (first generation), Nintendo DS, Panasonic Let's Note, Garakei cell phones, PDAs, Digital Ink E-Readers, and Casio Electronic Dictionaries. Technozen's music is often similar to and often is a part of tracks heard in Nintendo games, particularly on the Wii and DS. Technozen's music generally embodies a laid-back feeling, often utilizing glossy synths, highly quantized sampled acoustic instruments, electric pianos, soft flutes, and occasionally accordions. Influences range from New Age music, Synthwave, City Pop, Muzak, Bossa Nova, and Latin music. The music is typically instrumental, but it doesn't necessarily have to be. Artists The \"Zen\" in \"Technozen\" is due to its association in the west with Minimalist Asian aesthetics and its philosophy of simplicity. It's secular and unrelated to the Japanese meaning of Zen which pertains to a sect of Buddhism. The Technozen philosophy is centered around the harmonizing of technology and nature. It is a rejection of the fast-paced modern tech culture, favoring a more laid-back lifestyle. It is based on the belief that technology should improve life but not totally dominate it, it being minimalistic, but not to an absurd degree. The philosophy is not based on asceticism or extreme frugality; rather, it is based on simplicity and beauty. There is also a focus on health and wellbeing. The Technozen technology design philosophy is small and boxy, based on the idea of doing more with less space as opposed to doing less with more space. Utilizing both form and function on objects is also a key motif, being based on the idea that devices should be easily repaired and promotes the rejection of planned obsolescence. It can also be seen as a rejection of modern Big Tech monopolies, algorithms and internet overuse. Technozen favors helpful, user-friendly, but self contained gadgets which give power to the user rather than having power over the user. One of Technozen's core motifs is caring for the environment, reminiscent of green technology like Solarpunk but more politically neutral. Unlike Solarpunk, Technozen is not anti-capitalist, being open to people of various political leanings provided they care about the environment. Technozen interior design is intended for bright, well-lit areas, with lots of diffuse white light and few prominent shadows. It centers around minimalist white and light wood tones, with the rest of its palette range often serving as an accent. White plastics or paints used in Technozen can be matte, glossy, or a combination. Wood is typically unstained light woods, with a de-emphasized and unprominent wood grain. Bamboo can be used as a material, but it is rare to see distinctly \"bamboo\" shapes. Regardless of the material used, furniture is usually in artificial looking and mass producible shapes. Unlike normal Minimalism, rooms are made to be functional (often including storage) and are frequently accessorized with bright or cute things. Houseplants and electronics are common, fitting with its philosophical leanings. Home décor from Japanese variety store MUJI leans a lot towards Technozen, and \"MUJI-style\" rooms commonly embody this aesthetic. Scandinavian interior décor follows similar design principles, sometimes aligning with or borrowing from this aesthetic (notably IKEA). Marie Kondo's KonMari design philosophy strongly embodies Technozen: Asian-inspired minimalism, while hanging on to things that \"spark joy\".

Avril Lavigne is considered one of the pioneers of this aesthetic. Some of the visuals included in the Teenpunk aesthetic include: Some elements commonly used in Teenpunk outfits include: Pop-Punk music is a fusion genre between Pop and Punk Rock. Compared to traditional Punk music, Pop-Punk artists often incorporate juvenile topics into their songs rather than political ones. This includes topics such as love, breakups, anti-suburbia themes, etc.  Pop-Punk quickly became one of the most popular genres of music in the world, and it spawned a number of subgenres, such as emo pop, skate punk, and pop-rock. It influeced an important number of subcultures and music genres, including Teenpunk, Emo, Hyperpop, Hot Topic, 2020 Alt, Minivan Rock, etc. However, it's often deemed controversial due to its Corporate nature, particularly inside the typical Punk scene.",

In this aesthetic, women, typically from college-aged to early thirties, show images and videos of being productive and engaging in self-care and self-betterment. They live regimented routines that encourage healthy eating, beauty rituals, fitness, organization, productivity in work and study, and mental healthcare in a clean and simple aesthetic. The aesthetic is a continuation of many other aesthetics by young women that focus on health, and it has many precursors in marketing, especially in the skincare and fitness industries. The self-help and productivity part of YouTube, where vloggers demonstrate how to be productive and have a routine, is also an inspiration. It is an aspirational aesthetic and people in the aesthetic are concerned with becoming one's best self in terms of mind, body, and spirituality. This also involves a confident feeling and being kind to others, including gratitude. However, the aesthetic has largely been criticized for being part of the larger trend of toxic productivity and \"hustle culture,\" where people are expected to spend every moment of their lives bettering themselves to a manufactured and unrealistic standard instead of living an authentic life. The That Girl trend is part of a larger movement in the social media landscape where mental health and self-care has become a concept that people are concerned about. Visually, the aesthetic bears a lot of resemblance to spa culture. The marketing and ethos of spas share the same ideals of wellness, beauty, and relaxation, with imagery of face masks, spa water, meditation, etc. Likewise, many beauty companies, especially ones that emphasize skincare, have the same emphasis on aspirationally beautiful and clean women. That Girl culture is also a result of the more natural and \"dew-y\" beauty trend and brands that emerged after the Baddie beauty trends of heavy makeup. Glossier is an example. In this trend, the emphasis is on skincare and \"no makeup makeup,\" which That Girls wear, similar to Clean Girls. The first instance of the term \"That Girl\" is a viral TikTok by the user @angelxadvice in 2021. In it, she dances as a bullet-pointed list of New Year's resolutions showed on screens, with points such as \"eat more fruit and veg\" and \"read more books, trust me.\" Later that year, the tag was born. That Girl is largely based on the ideas of self-improvement, both externally in one's career and relationships, as well as internally with physical and mental health. You become \"that girl\" in your own way; how someone portrays becoming \"that girl\" will differ greatly from how anyone else portrays it. Becoming \"that girl\" is similar to being healthy, making changes for the better in your life, and constantly challenging yourself to improve. The theme of \"That girl\" is total mental and physical health. You are not required to always eat well-balanced meals and be the fittest female in the world. It's all about improving yourself, and you should do it on your own time and solely for yourself. Visuals of this aesthetic can include tidy spaces, organized drawers/cabinets, and clean bathrooms. Plastic compartment trays and bins where everything is uniform and in its place has a strong emphasis, especially with skincare and makeup collections. Organizing a space is a popular subject for many YouTube videos and TikToks, as well as cleaning vlogs being popular among this community as well. Healthy foods are also incredibly common in this aesthetic. Because of the strong emphasis on morning routines in this aesthetic, most of the foods shown are breakfast foods. Fresh fruits and vegetables are featured heavily in foods such as avocado toast, yogurt, salads, granola, peanut butter toast, açai bowls, smoothies, and fruit platters. The latter three are also notable for being colorful and would look pretty in the mostly white posts of That Girl. In addition to the food is the emphasis on beverages such as spa waters, coffee and matcha green tea. These drinks are often fancier than a plain coffee with milk, such as in the inclusion of milk alternatives, flavorings, cold brew, and foam.  Many vlogs show these girls making the drinks themselves or going out to a Starbucks or a local coffee shop as a treat. They also emphasize the importance of routine and labor, as they often make the beverage daily and show the relaxing motion of cutting the fruit, foaming the milk, etc. Because That Girl is primarily a routine and vlog-oriented aesthetic, visiting different mundane locations is incredibly common. Largely, the gym, neighborhood parks, and grocery stores are often featured in these videos. Exercise at home or at the gym is common. That Girl fashion is rooted in trendy, basic apparel. White and tan are the most prominent colors in That Girl aesthetic, with green oftentimes appearing as accent color. Hobbies for this aesthetic are meant to be enjoyable yet productive and good for the person involved. Music for this aesthetic mainly includes upbeat music and modern R&B artists This aesthetic is largely criticized for being an example of toxic productivity, which is a mindset where people are overly concerned with work and bettering oneself at an expense of giving up free time and relaxation. Although many of the activities in the aesthetic are deemed relaxing, all of these are pursued for the sake of becoming \"better\" and involve mental labor that does not need to be done for a functioning life. Many people have connected this to corporate culture, where people are encouraged to \"hustle\" for the sake of becoming better employees and leaders. In addition, the aesthetic is a mode of productivity that has been traditionally pushed on by pop culture that emphasizes routine, habit-formation, being a morning person, and organization. Many people are not suited for regimented routines and are more productive as night owls. In pushing the narrative onto young women that this type of lifestyle equals productivity and is the source of confidence and mental wellness, the people who are not suited for these habits may feel discouraged. Like many other aspirational aesthetics, people also criticize this aesthetic for being upper-class. The visuals emphasize purchasing items that are incredibly expensive, such as serums and avocados. In addition, there is a lot of emphasis on free time, where the vlogger is able to do the various activities because she is self-employed or not being required to do work that poorer people must do. However, other people disagree that \"that girl\" has a harmful outlook. Although many people depict it as being all about remaining thin and healthy, that is not the case. When you feel compelled to act in a certain way or to look and act in a certain way, even though the reality is that becoming that girl doesn't look the same for everyone, you have a poisonous attitude.  Simply having the desire of improving oneself is enough; you don't need to be striving to be flawless or thinner. Bettering yourself doesn't just mean changing the way you look; it also means improving your internal well-being and increasing your sense of fulfillment, joy, and self-assurance. Male (pref., but not always) and edgy (weird and ridiculous for its own sake) version of this, with those criticisms (toxic, looks-only, unhealthy competition...)  seen above, is Sigma,  Incel/Doomer-related hot(s)pot ideologies, and (among similar such others) Manly Men - bearing similar (That Girl) connotations due varying similar themes.",

This aesthetic was popular from 1995 to 1997, overlapping with the VH1 Sepia Sky aesthetic. It is named after the music video channel The Box. During this time, R&B videography began to include richer palettes and a more vivid style. This aesthetic was succeeded by Cheiron Crush, MTV Green Sky, and Shiny Suit 97. Artists with burgundy coats, black leather jackets, and lime green outfits were regularly seen in videos at the time. The production of the music had a stronger pop mood than R&B releases at the beginning of the decade. Its expansive arrangements, intricate bridges, and intense vocal delivery are what really set its songs apart. The term was coined by designer Steves Peeps in 2023.",

Playing off of the roots of heavy metal, thrash got its start in the early 80s with a group of bands commonly known as the \"Big 4\" of thrash: Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, and later Megadeth after Dave Mustaine's departure from Metallica. James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, the co-founders of Metallica, often credited Diamond Head as influences to their music. Influences broadly came from both Hardcore punk and various \"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\" bands. Thrash, however, was much more loose and aggressive with complex riffs and less of a focus on vocals sounding professional, but rather as aggressive as possible. While consistent themes in their lyrics would develop more into the 90s, most songs of the subgenre focused on partying or just sounding intense. Most album artwork at this point in thrash's life was illustrated, unlike the heavy metal bands before it that often used edited photos of either the band members or other objects/people for their album covers. Once again likely taking inspiration from Iron Maiden's \"Eddie\" and Mötörhead's \"Warpig\", thrash came with its own set of mascot characters, like Megadeth's \"Vic Rattlehead\" and Anthrax's \"Not Man\". The album artwork was normally of a professional painter quality with muted colors and off-putting imagery, which gave the albums a very noticeable look on shelves. When the 90s came around, thrash was making a definite statement about what it wanted to be and the messages it wanted to push. While the themes of anarchism and general anti-authoritarianism had always been a factor, 90s thrash held nothing back when it came to its political messages, almost crossing over with punk at times. Certain bands also delved into a form of satire where the band members would perform as political/moral undesirables in their lyrics, such as S.O.D. (Stormtroopers of Death) and GWAR. The partying aspect of thrash remained strong as well, possibly more heavy handed than before. While not much had changed in the art scene between the 80s and 90s, certain bands like D.R.I. (Dirty Rotten Imbeciles) and Acid Reign had begun implementing a more comic-like style into their album covers. This gave them a certain edge that would deter parents while still being relatively clean, hinting to the band's anti-authority lifestyle. The style of the 80s albums was still prevalent, but many albums focused more on random imagery like shots of teeth and eyes rather than more complex pieces that seemed to have some underlying meaning. Some people like to believe thrash died in the 90s with the rise of Nu Metal/Metalcore, but this is simply untrue. While not having the mainstream popularity it once did (which some may argue was the point of metal in the first place), many thrash bands still work in the seedy underbelly to give you the music you love. Sound-wise, many bands have gone back to the more comfortable 80s style of thrash, though it hadn't changed much over the decades to begin with. Some bands, like Lich King, use the subgenre to poke fun at how self serving thrash bands used to be, like with Metallica's \"Whiplash\". Nowadays, thrash album art serves as a bit of a blend between the 80s' insightful painted work and the 90s' more cartoonish themes. While the skill is there, a lot of the artwork features scenes that would have been utilized in a less complex art style. For most, dressing like a thrasher is pretty easy; it usually consists of a band tee (sometimes with the sleeves removed), some jeans (but usually shorts, especially in the summer), a pair of sneakers and some long hair. However, some people go above and beyond and create a battle jacket comprised of many patches from several bands. While this exists in all metal subgenres to varying degrees, thrashers and death metalheads create the article of clothing most commonly, with black metal falling close behind and punks doing it in a slightly different fashion. Another less common but still prevalent item is the bullet belt (bandolier), which is exactly what it sounds like. This is arguably the most expensive item in the thrasher arsenal, with authentic ones running for over $100 each. (currently a WIP, still have to add in a photo gallery.)",

People who are involved in this aesthetic have “Thrift Hauls”, where they purchase goods from thrift stores. Thriftcore visuals put a strong emphasis on vintage and retro goods that are bought at thrift stores.  While the most popular items bought at thrift stores are clothing, some people will buy retro toys, furniture, old electronics, and things that are sold in major retail locations.  The only downside to this is you are at the mercy of whatever the thrift store has in stock, and that can change from day to day. Visuals are also taken from historical images taken in the 60s-90s eras, old worn photos are best as they give an aged look that give the vintage color.

Common characteristics include wearing masculine clothing and engaging in games and activities that are physical in nature and are considered in many cultures to be unfeminine or the domain of boys. This aesthetic often features feminist themes. Tomboyish girls are free-spirited, tough, sassy, and wild. They love to do fun things and be free to live the way they like. They are also often more chill and quiet in comparison to other girls. The tomboy concept has developed over the years, as stated in this article. Around the 1840s-1860s, the tomboy concept was actually rooted in racist and misogynistic ideas. Since white people feared that their race would die out, they became concerned for the health of white women and therefore encouraged them to lead more active and typically male life styles. This was also thought to prepare them for marriage and motherhood. This later linked to third wave feminism. Some tomboyish girls identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community and are lesbian and/or queer, and tomboyism is often associated with Butch/Stud lesbianism and rejects traditional gender norms for girls and women, who identify with a more masculine identity. However, we do not need to be LGBTQ+ to be tomboyish. Anybody of any background, lifestyle, and orientation can be tomboyish. Tomboyish fashion consists of feminine outfits modeled after masculine fashions.  Things such as: Often times, however, it can be paired with more feminine fashion accessories, such as golden hoop earrings. Contrary to popular belief, many tomboyish girls still like shopping, albeit usually not at the same stores or types of stores as girly girls. However, there can sometimes be overlap. Tomboyish-styled makeup can be anywhere from none at all to heavy. Some makeup styles can include: Popular tomboyish hairstyles are things like messy buns, short cuts, naturals, and ponytails. Genres popular within the aesthetic include: Contrary to popular belief, not all tomboyish girls are \"dumb\" or \"hate school.\" Many tomboyish girls like academic subjects that involve action or adventure such as history, geography, geology, biology, paleontology, astronomy, anthropology, archaeology, and photography. Some of them also like action and adventure books as well as technology and engineering. Many tomboyish girls also like to drink beer, whiskey, or vodka but other alcohol such as wine, margaritas, and martinis can be a bit too girly for them. Bro Hoe is a more sexualized version of the Tomboy aesthetic, described as \"McBling but with more edgy &  masculine elements\". Bro Hoes are usually defined as girls who hang around guys who dirtbike or are tattoo artists.  Because of the edgy element to Bro Hoe, there is some crossover with the Scene aesthetic as well, although Bro Hoe doesn't go as over-the-top and alt as Scene does. Bro Hoe fashion revolves around graphic tees, often from brands such as Ed Hardy, Metal Mulisha, Konflict, Famous, and Affliction, as well as accessories such as bandanas, baseball caps, piercings, and tattoos.  Clothing with the Monster logo or the \"Trucker girl\" on it are also popular amongst the Bro Hoes. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

Trad Goths have been cited to listen to (but not be bound to) officially classified goth music, such as Goth Rock, Deathrock, darkwave, coldwave, minimalwave and ethereal wave. The aesthetic is most often used in reference to the 80s British and Celtic Goth rock scene that developed in clubs like The Batcave, although it is a generalization. The truth is that Post-Punk and Goth came up all around the world during this time, including in America (Deathrock), Spain (Moldova/Sinestro), Japan, Germany (Grufti), Vienna, Argentina, etc. It peaked in the 90s, but soon collapsed with the over-popularity of industrial/EBM music, which was associated with Goth (although it hadn’t grown out of Goth rock or Post-Punk). Modern Trad Goths or OG Goths are devoted to the core Post-Punk-born musical scene, from the late 70s to the modern era. They also revere and respect “Elder Goths”, namely individuals who experienced the 80s and 90s scenes. Due to this devotion, they are often misunderstood and misconstrued as “elitists” and “gatekeepers” by people who like the clothing and aesthetic but don’t put proper focus on the music involved. For this reason, many Nu-Goths and Pastel Goths are frustrated with Trad Goths and vise-versa. In truth, most Trad Goths are extremely open-minded in terms of what constitutes Goth music and towards the modern scene. All that matters to them is the understanding that it did develop from Post-Punk, and understanding Goth as a legitimate musical genre with certain guidelines to its sound and subsequent evolution. They listen to all kinds of music, but they know the difference between Goth and other darkly inclined musical genres. Unlike newer dark sub-cultures with the “Goth” suffix (like Nu-Goth and Pastel Goth) modern Trad Goths try to be mindful of the religious, cultural, and political iconography used (in comparison to the 80s and 90s scenes) in their fashion. They are well-read in these fields and understand the influences in the imagery they use. In the modern era, much Trad Goth information comes from blogs like Post-Punk.com (vital to learn about new music in the scene and in related scenes) and YouTube channels/playlists by Cadaver Kelley and Angela Benedict. It’s important to remember that people of all religious, cultural, and political backgrounds are in and have been in the Goth scene since it began. They aren’t limited in their style and aesthetic expression (ie, black is not always used despite its popularity in the scene). The only thing that draws them together is their love for Goth music, their appreciation of the culture’s past, and an excitement over its future. They can be found in Goth and 80s-rewind nights at clubs, coffee shops, bookstores, and record shops having stimulating conversations about literature, music, and the arts. They can often be spotted wearing DIY jackets covered in pins and patches of their favorite bands, exaggerated dark-colored eyeliner, and smoking clove cigarettes (with or without nicotine). Music is incredibly important to Trad Goths. Here are some examples (mostly from the 80s just to show how many bands there have been around the world since then): It’s important to note that 80s Goth styles were far more varied than they became popular in the 90s. There was no restriction to black or dark colors and different bands evolved different looks. Because of this and because Goth is mainly a musical scene, it’s possible for a Trad Goth to dress in any way they want to, particularly since the scene has had so many different looks and aesthetic facets. In the 80s, they tended towards stereotypical Batcave and Trad Goth styles, Deathrock (which is a somewhat more punk variant), or the nameless ethereal, romantic, and bohemian type styles now grouped under Woodland Goth and Ethereal Goth. This is mostly using names and terms from the 80s before the term “Goth” was used. (This is also before the terms Ethereal Goth and Woodland Goth were used or fully delineated, so the generalization of 4AD is used to describe the aesthetic.) Nico (of The Velvet Underground) is considered by most OG Goth bands to be the godmother of the scene. Frustrated with the twee folk genre she had been lumped into, she rebelled (with encouragement from Jim Morrison) and created the album The Marble Index in the late 60s. This is widely considered to be the first Goth album (see the main Wiki page for Nico). For this express reason, Nico was later adopted into the 80s Goth scene. She performed with Bauhaus, opened for Siouxsie and the Banshees, and toured with Gene Loves Jezebel, thus cementing her status as an overlooked Goth legend. The term “Batcave” is in reference to the niche British club The Batcave, which helped start the Goth (at that time called Positive Punk) movement in that country during the early 80s. It was owned by Ollie Wisdom of The Batcave house band, The Specimen. What made it unusual at the time was that it exclusively played alternative/independent music and refused anything remotely “pop”. As such, many other bands developed in this club including The Virgin Prunes, Alien Sex Fiend, and Danielle Dax. Yet before The Batcave, in the late 70s, there were several bands that later performed there, and are now considered progenitors of Goth. Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and The Damned all appeared slightly before The Batcave, indulging in what they described as “punk” or (in Bauhaus’ case) “dark glam”. The seeds these three bands had sown with their gothic, almost-costume fashions, morbid lyrics, and bass-driven Post-Punk lead to an explosion of bands that made music and used imagery in a similar vein (including the most famous, The Sisters of Mercy).

This aesthetic can also be considered as a sub-genre to New Age due to them both sharing the same music-genre and focus on wellness/serenity. However, Tranquil Spa Graphics is mostly focused on calming visuals and Zen and Pure Land Buddhist themes. (Under construction) (Under construction) The history of Tranquil Spa Graphics themes has a connection to Buddhist tradition, with roots tracing back to 1st through 5th century India with the rise of Pure Land and Zen Buddhism. Pure Land, emphasizing rebirth in a tranquil paradise full of beautiful lotus flowers and golden palaces, and Zen, focusing on meditation and enlightenment, both valued inner peace and tranquility. These philosophies influenced Chinese art in the 8th century, where depictions of serene landscapes and nature became a way to reflect spiritual concepts. This artistic style gained popularity in China and eventually traveled to Japan in the Heian Period (794 – 1185), where fanciful artwork of the Pure Land became popular among the aristocracy. With the development of modern design programs in the 1990s and early 2000s the modern form of Tranquil Spa Graphics were created, being heavily inspired by the Buddhist artwork that preceded it. The history of the lotus flower spans back thousands of years ago, with it even being worshiped back in ancient Egypt. The symbolism of the lotus can vary from culture to culture, but in general, it is agreed to be a symbol for purity, strength, and rebirth due to the fact that lotuses can rise from mud without any stains. In both Zen and Pure Land Buddhism, the lotus flower holds profound symbolic significance, embodying spiritual purity and the journey towards awakening. In Zen Buddhism, the lotus represents the unfolding of one's true nature through mindfulness and meditation. Conversely, in Pure Land Buddhism, the lotus signifies the promise of rebirth in the pure land of Amitabha Buddha, where it blooms effortlessly amidst beautiful ponds. Music is a pretty prominent aspect of Tranquil Spa Graphics, as it can have a huge effect on one’s emotions. In most cases, the music tends to lack actual lyrics, and instead consists of nature ambiances such as waterfalls, wind, or chirping birds, and occasionally with soft instruments in the background such as the piano. This music is also known as New-Age music, and is mainly used for meditation and relaxation. Here are a few examples of channels who make this genre of music: The visuals for Tranquil Spa Graphics feature elements that can be associated with serenity, wellness, and meditation. This usually consists of stuff such as flowers, water, bubbles, nature, bamboo, and stones. Lotus flowers in particular tend to be a pretty common motif as they symbolize purity, overcoming stress, and rebirth. (Read more about lotus flower symbolism here.) In more modern imagery, much like Y2K Futurism and Helvetica Aqua Aero, it’s quite common to see CGI be used, which (depending on the context), can sometimes make it overlap into the early 2000s CGI genre. In some instances, visuals can sometimes even overlap with aesthetics such as Frutiger Eco due to the highly saturated and luscious depictions of nature/greenery, however, Tranquil Spa Graphics tends to be much more oriental and isn’t commonly associated with tech.",

Common visuals associated with Trashcore are decaying/decayed buildings, trash, moldy scenery, old antiques, vintage artworks, and anything that could generally be considered trashy, destroyed, or hideous.  It can also feature animals commonly associated with trash (such as raccoons, opossum, badgers, rats, bears, and any other sort of animal that might be caught mulling around in people's trash) doing their thing in civilization. Trashcore fashion is very similar to crustpunk. There isn't a sense of anarchy to trashcore, but ripped clothes that are either homemade or from the thrift shop are common. T-shirts with doodles or weird phrases scribbled on with marker is something you'll see in Trashcore. You'll also see a lot of references to opossums, rats, raccoons, and other animals who seem to thrive in urban and suburban settings.  It can also incorporate things such as ribbons, pearls, corsets, feathers, rosaries, discolored lace, worn-out silk, or anything that, many years ago, would've been considered in fashion but have been so worn down by time that it can't even be salvaged in even a \"Vintage\"-inspired aesthetic.

Mental, emotional, and spiritual abuse are also common themes in traumacore. Traumacore in general tends to be more focused on trauma experienced in childhood, explaining the cute visuals, although adult trauma can also be covered. Many people turn to these images to help them cope with the pain they suffered in the past. Most images for traumacore are ones of Hello Kitty, Dreamcore, Nostalgiacore, or even something like a cake, all overlapped with dark messages. While many people say traumacore isn't inherently an aesthetic, many of the images used in its photo or video edits are derived from other aesthetics. Traumacore is more of a type of art therapy or visual journaling for many people with trauma. It is worth noting that some people who have went through trauma and use traumacore have stated that traumacore is an aesthetic, (albeit a special kind of aesthetic) while others state that it isn't, since those without trauma may try to romanticize the experiences of traumatized individuals. Whether it's an aesthetic or not, its cultural impact is notable enough to be on this wiki. It is frowned upon to participate in traumacore if the participant is not a survivor of some kind of trauma themselves, as it is considered fetishization of a very serious issue. Trauma consumes many people's lives. Traumacore can be of use as a coping mechanism for those who need it. However, like any kind of coping mechanism, it should not be a stand-in for proper treatment, like therapy or medication. Many traumacore edits have negative words or phrases in them (ex: \"I am broken\", \"I will never be clean\", \"you used me\", \"rotten child\", \"please stop\", \"you ruined me\"), which reflects on the creator/participant's feelings about themselves and their experiences. Having a way of getting these thoughts out onto a screen or paper can be helpful, as it puts feelings into a visual form that is easier to understand, and also participates as a form of the aesthetic. The Morute aesthetic is the clearest predecessor of Traumacore, and as the aesthetic declined, Traumacore took over in popularity. Before the advent of naming aesthetics with the suffix -core, Academia, etc. in the early to mid-2010s, the Tumblr community found their aesthetics through combining various tags, such as #creepy, #cute, #vintage, etc., with Morute being a later name. The aesthetic was popular, and even possibly based on, the female music artist Nicole Dollanganger, who is not as emphasized in today's traumacore community. The morute aesthetic had the same premise of traumacore; users would contrast delicate and sweet imagery with dark subject matter relating to depression, suicide, eating disorders, child sexual abuse, religious abuse, and abusive relationships. However, multiple tropes associated with traumacore today were largely absent. Sanrio edits and Weirdcore imagery did not appear, and there was more explicit material such as gore. The aesthetic also differed slightly from modern traumacore in that it utilized more medical horror, Southern Gothic, and Victorian imagery such as medical instruments and textbooks, disturbing larvae and butterfly-like monsters, conjoined twins, and daguerreotypes. Horror movie imagery such as Ouija boards, female ghosts, porcelain dolls, and serial killer-dressed men standing ominously was also popular, and the best way to describe the aesthetic at the time was \"victim of a horror movie villain.\" A lot of this overlapped with Cult Party Kei, a fashion that spread to America at that time. Traumacore draws upon a delicate, childlike but implicitly disturbing concept, and aims to blend the unsettling with the innocent. Dolls, angels, bedrooms, and corpses are common motifs used. There is often a contrast between the imagery and the text in a traumacore visual (for example, one might put a disturbing message under a photo of a porcelain doll or a character from children's media). Many of those who enjoy traumacore are also fond of the \"rotting aesthetic:\" imagery of bugs, dirt, and mold are often incorporated to represent this theme. It is also common for traumacore aesthetics to reference religious themes (such as crosses, angels, and mentions of Heaven or Hell). Traumacore aesthetics are generally soft or girlish, though this is not always the case (for example, male followers of traumacore tend to employ more masculine colors and themes). Many traumacore edits also include nostalgic imagery, as people's trauma happens very often during childhood. Some examples of this are Sanrio characters (like Hello Kitty), children's bedrooms, playgrounds, and other places and things relevant to childhood. Happycore is the more supportive version of this aesthetic, based more upon coping than combining trauma itself with cuteness. One of the main arguments against traumacore is its romanticization and aestheticization of mental illness and abuse. In depicting depression, eating disorders, sexual abuse, etc. as beautiful concepts, people who appreciate the aesthetic may seek out these kinds of experiences, which would endanger their health and invalidate the experiences of people who are traumatized and would not want anyone to mimic their experience. For people who have been traumatized, traumacore imagery can cause people to center their identity around these negative emotions and hinder attempts at recovery and developing a personality beyond what they were like while experiencing trauma. Different visuals can also trigger the viewer into past behaviors because of the desire for beauty, such as survivors of eating disorders relapsing after being constantly exposed to images of small and delicate girls. An issue within the traumacore community is cross-tagging, which is the act of adding non-trauma-related hashtags to traumacore posts. This can be very dangerous, as it allows for people to stumble across triggering posts without deliberately searching for them. (It has been said not to add Sanrio-related tags on traumacore posts because kids and people who are not comfortable with seeing traumacore imagery may be scrolling through these topics.[1]) If you post or repost any traumacore content, please use ONLY traumacore related tags and refrain from using unrelated tags (such as #sanrio, #aesthetic, #pastel, etc.) Another issue within the community is art theft. This includes reposting edits with no credit, reposting edits with improper credit (writing simply \"credits to the artist/creator\"), claiming others' works as one's own, or reposting/using others' work in edits without permission. When reposting traumacore edits/art, first make sure the original artist allows reposts, then clearly type their username in the post description.

The term 'Trillwave' was birthed from two simple things: \"Trill\" - which originally had a colossal boatload of meanings when referencing music production - was turned into slang in the late 90s to early 2000s. Trill combines the words \"true\" and \"real\" to form \"trill\", while \"wave\" is there because everything deemed aesthetic had the \"wave\" suffix attached to them back then when the name was coined. (Don't take that statement literally.) Trill can also be used to describe art. It has no solid definition, and if someone calls a song, artwork, etc., \"Trill\", it can mean: Later, as you move down to the visual part of this wiki, we'll explain each visual characteristic of Trillwave, and how it utilizes various pieces of other aesthetics and transforms them into a whole new thing. The earliest form of \"trill\" music was Memphis Rap, also known as Memphis Horrorcore (depending on who you ask). Memphis Horrorcore would essentially be the birth of trap. Three Six Mafia would help invent the triplet rap flow, which many rappers to this day use in many songs. The signature sound of jazz/funk samples often used on top of raw drums, snares, hats, percussions, and cowbells. It really was a whole new sound the world hadn't heard before. This aesthetic would also extend beyond music, with the cover art for a lot of the mid-to-late 90s Memphis albums being misty, dark, often devilish, and very obviously done on a budget. All in all, Memphis Rap is an important part of Trillwave. Once the late 2000s rolled around, new generation artists started to experiment with trap/rap music, and in the early 2010s, \"phonk\" was born due to the infamous artist SpaceGhostPurrp. Phonk would forever change the world of hip-hop and helped define the early 2010s \"swag era\" or \"trill era\". Suddenly, everyone was saying they were \"trill\" and listening to trillwave. A$AP Rocky - Purple Swag & SpaceGhostPurrp - Friday come to mind and are great examples of how trillwave sounded initially. Whereas Rocky's take on the genre was a bit more professional sounding, SpaceGhostPurrp's take was a lot more raw, authentic, and influential to the genre, as many amateur artists could better replicate the raw feel. Most of Trillwave's aesthetic is in the cover arts that were used. Cover arts on SoundCloud and YouTube were special, as they heavily enhanced the vibes of artist pages, and the songs themselves. To many artists, a good cover art was just as important as the music itself. Despite what was said above, regular \"trill\" edits exist! Trillwave art that was never intended for cover art, usually including the same editing style as vaporwave & trillwave, just without the obvious \"Artist x Single/EP name\" text. Visually, Trillwave takes inspiration from every single internet aesthetic, ever (and also inspired a LOT of internet aesthetics). Elements of Cleancore, Junglecore, Seapunk, Vaporwave, Synthwave, Kawaii, Mizuiro, Y2K Futurism, Frutiger Aero, and Old Web all can be seen in the visuals of Trillwave. We will go over some of the various aesthetics Trillwave used. At first, Trillwave was - as said, inspired by Memphis Rap. A lot of 90s Memphis cover arts were a LOT like Vaporwave. PNG edits, flipped images (mirroring them on either side), hue shifting, etc. This is what early trill art was. Even simple stuff like images turned black and white with some text on it. Once 2013 came around, a popular trend for trill beats were the infamous \"white space\" cover arts. Basically, take a PNG of something (you can check Cleancore's wiki page for some examples), add a white background, and boom. Trillwave cover art. If you were too lazy to add the white background yourself, simply upload a .PNG to SoundCloud as your cover art, and SoundCloud would add the white background. inter▼ene is an artist who used a lot of PNG cover arts, or minimalist cover arts, and Yung Bazooka was an artist who used white space cover arts frequently, with a lot more color to the subject (the PNG). This trend lasted up until around 2016. It's still around, just not nearly as commonplace. Trillwave (bordering on HolyTrap) also takes inspiration from Junglecore as mentioned; a lot of songs throughout 2013-2014 used photos of forests, rainforests, jungles, woods, etc. This aesthetic combined Vaporwave and Junglecore, on top of the blank space art, sometimes using potted plants in an empty white void, or trees in an empty white void, or trees Photoshopped onto more trees, the list goes on. Retro, Vaportrap, Nerdcore, and even HolyTrap sometimes use \"Kawaii\" aesthetics, such as anime screenshots (and lewd anime screenshots), pink cover art, Hello Kitty, Y2K Futurism, anime girl renders, etc. This was very popular with artists like GF Retro, Melo Flamez, Josip on Deck, Kay-P AKA Baby Shiva, and many others. Corporate imagery can also be used as Trillwave cover art, and often was; pictures of glass skyscrapers, bright cloudy skies, architecture design plans (usually with Photoshopped people), architecture in general, and white/grey themed cover art. This was very popular in 2013-2014; people like Lil Netzero & cight often used these covers, and added a whole new atmosphere to their beats. Terrorwave was also used by a handful of artists, especially Lil Netzero in particular. Visuals in cover art tends to consist of people in military gear, ski masks, camo outfits, etc. Usually the beats had a more darker theme to them to accompany the art. One BIG aesthetic is the ever-so-popular \"angelic\" or \"holy\" aesthetic. Used all the time with HolyTrap & Wave producers. Pictures of Roman architecture, pictures of angel statues (usually crying or in a depressing pose), so on. The most famous example of this aesthetic is the Neptune Pool in San Simeon, California. An image of this beautiful pool was used as the cover art to Cight's LEGENDARY \"ＡＲＣＨＩＴＥＣＴＵＲＥ／／ＥＰ\" (this pool wasn't the OG cover for the EP, but it was changed to this, and most recognize it instantly as \"oh yeah, that's the architecture cover\"). This EP is considered by many people to be the \"final frontier\" of Trillwave. This EP featured some of the biggest Trillwave producers at the time; 0% boys, Falco, greg, KLNV (later known as Night Lovell), and Benjamin. Released May 31, 2014, it was very advanced for its time. People are still discovering this EP 10 years later, and many fans have returned to appreciate the EP. Beyond direct inspiration from other internet aesthetics, Trillwave directly influenced aesthetics such as Vaporwave. Vaporwave also influenced Trillwave; they were like brother and sister, constantly innovating each other's aesthetic and shaping it into what would be their \"peak\" era, 2013-2016. Vaporwave started to include a lot of guns, marijuana (and drugs in general), hue-shifted images, aptly-named \"leaned out\" images (purple hue images), the perfect symmetrical art (PNG galore), and so on, around 2013. Vaporwave then used a lot of statue heads, trees, specific color schemes, and much more, that Trillwave started to use in its own art. We'll start off with a basic list of some of the earliest Trillwave artists. Early Trillwave was DIRECTLY inspired by old Memphis Rap as we mentioned above, but this time with a twist. Modern production styles, video game and anime samples and references as well as pop culture references in general, mixed with gritty mixing styles and old Memphis vocal samples. Raider Klan was an early Trillwave pioneer collective on SoundCloud, the group was birthed in the late 2000s, but didn't explode into the inspiration fountain until a bit later. Raider Klan was again, inspired by Memphis Rap, and included a huge roster of artists that are well known today: Chris Travis, SpaceghostPurrp, Xavier Wulf, Amber London, Yung Simmie, Eddy Baker, Key Nyata, Ruben Slikk, the list goes on and on. The gritty mixing of Raider Klan songs, mixed with the dark samples, train horns, cell phone SFX, amongst many other signature sounds, was what made Raider Klan stand out: Modern production with clear old-school inspiration. As time went on, there were inner conflicts within Raider Klan, so the gang split up to go do their own thing, sometimes in groups. Ethelwulf went on to make a variety of songs, some inspired by anime or video games, some Memphis-inspired tracks, and the same went for Chris Travis, who started making his signature \"wavy\" trill music in 2012, his album \"Pizza & Codeine\" still being a fan favorite amongst many a decade later. One of the most important albums for Trillwave was Lil Ugly Mane's legendary Mista Thug Isolation, which incorporated the lo-fi and mysterious sound of Memphis Rap into a modern context, using production techniques that had never been used before in Memphis Rap. This album helped (in addition to the work of SpaceGhostPurpp) that Memphis Rap had a revival, which would later lead to the creation of Phonk and Drift Phonk. In 2012, Yung Lean started gaining traction in the trill scene: a white Swedish kid making trill music and uploading it to YouTube, with some Vaporwave-esque music videos. Fiji Water, bucket hats, Adidas, Arizona Iced Tea, trill and imperfect beats. As many of you know, Ginseng Strip was released early 2013, and was a staple of the time. This song was an instant hit, and loved by many in the scene. Raw, trill sound with goofy lyrics that didn't take itself too seriously. This was the pinnacle of trill music. To top it off, Yung Gud did fantastic work on the beat. A rare sample with perfect hat patterns and a reverbed Lex Luger snare. It was really the sound of this time. Without a doubt, Yung Lean brought Trillwave to the masses again. Yung Lean pioneered the aesthetic even further, taking heavy inspiration from Vaporwave at the time. Otaku culture at this time was starting to rise up (around 2011-2013), so a lot of songs were catering + made by anime and video game fans. Trillwave is the parent to the subgenres born, so let's talk about them. ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND - These subgenres can blend, mix, mash, you name it. Trillwave is not a strict aesthetic. You are NOT bound to one sub-genre. In the early 2010s rapper SpaceGhostPurrp changed the rap game with his new style of dark, brooding beats and Memphis rap-inspired hip hop. From there he would go patent the style he referred to as Phonk and go on to be one of the most influential hip hop artists of the 2010s. It featured distorted, dark, brooding, and ethereal beats, hardcore lyricism with often distorted and lo-fi vocals and heavy inspiration from the Pen & Pixel album covers of southern hip hop. SGP would form a collective called Raider Klan putting on many artists who would go on to reach high levels of popularity such as Denzel Curry and Xavier Wulf, Like Cloud rap in the same era, SGP came through with a much darker form of it developed independently of cloud rap. As we said before, another album that greatly influenced the sound of that time was Mista Thug Isolation by Lil Ugly Mane, bringing many production techniques never before seen in Memphis rap. Which led many producers to experiment with the Memphis sound, leading to unique projects that mixed the lo-fi and mysterious sound of Memphis, the psychedelic production of Chopped N' Screwed and the ethereality of the then new, Cloud Rap. thus creating what we know today as Phonk. Phonk is undeniably the biggest subgenre to come from trillwave, as it's still being innovated and produced en masse today. Phonk is essentially what Raider Klan was, and still is, as mentioned before regarding modern productions with old-school inspiration. Phonk evolved a lot from the early 2011-2012 days. By 2013-2014, a lot of producers came into the scene and started combining more jazzy and ethereal samples, paired with Memphis vocals, Lex Luger snares, loud kicks, trap hihats, amongst video game and anime SFX. some early pioneers of phonk (as we know it today) are DJ Smokey, Lil Ugly Mane, EPVR, Soudiere, Mythic, HymBeats, DJ Yung Vamp, and Roland Jones. Do keep in mind these are not the only early pioneers, just artists who are well respected in the scene (and ones that are easy to recall). Youtube channels such as Trillphonk and NxrthNxrthPhonk would also help popularize the style. With the domination of Raider Klan in the early 2010s many rappers were releasing albums in the style and taking influence from the movement. Important to note, while Drift Phonk is sadly still considered Trillwave, it is widely hated by original Phonk artists, as it is basically corporate minimalism, but in music form. Generic cowbell melodies, distorted 808s, repetitive flow and acapella usage, it is considered \"the death of phonk\". A video, made by the great Yokai, explained how Spotify assisted in the death of Phonk by exclusively promoting Drift Phonk on their official Phonk playlist... completely leaving out the founding fathers, and the people who helped shaped the subgenre (at this point, a MAIN genre) to what it is today. Retro is a very misleading but also straightforward genre. It's not Synthwave or Madonna copycat music, it's simply trap beats specifically made with retro videogame samples, and anime samples. Retro beats are very hard to Google as we're sure you can imagine, so this subgenre is obscure as can be in the present day. Believe it or not, a lot of artists that made it big today, were once \"Retro\". Lil Yachty, Lil Peep, XXXTentacion, Suicideboys, Soulja Boy, Chris Travis, Xavier Wulf, etc. Some of their earlier songs were rapped on Kaine Solo beats, named for a legendary figure in the underground. His beats are instantly recognizable by his thuddy (not muddy) kicks, low pitch hihats, low pitched Lex Luger snare, and his snare rolls, paired with his clever SFX usage and samples. The majority of rappers used his beats; his beats were so good that $crim from $uicideboy$ stole his beat for their \"Kill Yourself PT. 1\" song, and put his \"DJ $crim with that 808!\" and \"This a $crim beat!\" tag on it, completely discrediting Kaine Solo. Retro started out with JosipOnDeck, Soulja Boy, Sensei Ion, and GF Retro, just to mention a handful. Josip would make the ever-so-popular \"Anime Pu$$y\" song with Killa Karisma, back in 2014. This song was praised by the legendary Etika, and has gone down as one of the \"Retro anthems\", despite many listeners not even knowing that this is a subgenre. Josip, Sensei Ion, and Soulja Boy would often rap about video games, anime, or use the legendary \"Retro! Retro!\" adlibs in their songs in the early days, on top of the anime or videogame samples. These songs were similar to Crunk music and these were mostly inspired by Lil B, based music that appealed to a niche audience, otakus and gamers. GF Retro eventually entered the scene, and started to make retro beats, producing for some of the bigger underground artists (as far as this niche goes), such as XXXTentacion and Hentai Dude. GF Retro would be a huge inspiration to many, as his 8bit and 16bit chiptune melodies, usage of obscure videogame samples, percussion usage, and style in general would be perfect for otaku rap. GF Retro was heavily influenced by Melo Flamez starting out, who also was an OG in the scene who made retro beats, usually sampling later OSTs such as PS1, PS2, N64, etc. Not as chiptuney, but still retro. Melo Flamez produced for artists such as Yung Hurn, Xavier Wulf, Braxton Knight, and FLASH GIORDANI. YouTube \"type beats\" also were heavily carrying retro at this time. 2011-2013, lots of producers (Natsu Fuji, Raisi K, DJ SonicFreak, etc) were uploading to YouTube and forever expanding the reach of retro music. Many gamers and anime fans loved this fairly new genre. They did a lot for the scene, and are also early pioneers. Retro expanded for years, eventually bringing a new array of collectives. GoldSamuraiEmpire (later turned into RSE - Retro Samurai Empire), Retro Mob, GOTHRETRO, Village Klick (VVG), and so on. While Nerdcore has its own page, its blunder years will be mentioned here. Nerdcore was VERY MUCH like Retro. Typically, Nerdcore was rap music, using Retro & Vaportrap beats. The subjects of the songs were a mix of regular ol' Trillwave (have intercourse with women, acquire currency, spend said currency, you know... but replace the \"intercourse with women\" part with ANIME women, now we're on to something). Josip On Deck evolved into a Nerdcore artist, same with Hentai Dude and many others. Nerdcore has since evolved (for better or worse) into a more broad genre, often using drill beats and sometimes even rock beats. It has a long and complicated history, way more ambitious than this little subgenre section. To keep it simple, Vaportrap is the ＷＡＶＹ version of Retro. Again sampling videogames, anime, yada yada.. but with reverb! Some OG vaportrap producers are YUNG MIST, Jonathan Joestar, S?K, SHAMPOOGOD, Pool Owner, Blank Banshee, and VAPERROR. Unlike retro, Vaportrap focuses a *bit* more on ambient pads and other more \"misty\" sounds, but still utilizes a heapload of retro samples. As a quick disclaimer, Retro CAN be Vaportrap, and Vaportrap CAN be Retro. Vaportrap just has a MAIN focus of the things mentioned above, instead of purely sampled music. Everybody knows Vaporwave, damnit. Vaporwave was birthed by the trill movement in a way. That probably sounds crazy to you, so here's an explanation. Vaporwave at first, typically, was sampled music. Slowed down, reverbed, chopped up, does this sound familiar? Chopped & Screwed music has been around since the 90s, with the infamous DJ Screw being the inventor behind it. Many of the same characteristics as Vaporwave, chopped music, slowed down and sometimes with enhanced atmosphere. Since the death of DJ Screw in 2000, many American DJs have carried on the chopped & screwed legacy, and it has definitely showed its legacy in the earlier Vaporwave music. Later on of course, Vaporwave evolved, and although a lot of artists stuck to their sampled 80s and 90s R&B roots, that is a finite source. Eventually Vaporwave evolved to be more ambient, sometimes noisier, with a deeper aesthetic. That said, it's important we cover where Vaporwave was birthed. While Vaporwave artists pioneered their own aesthetic visually, and vaporwave didn't rely on rap music to chop and slow, the idea was very much birthed from the same parent, Trillwave. Nowadays, Vaporwave is its own main genre, and nobody in 2023 still considers Vaporwave to be a little subgenre. Once again, phonk, but ＷＡＶＹ. Vaporphonk gained popularity in around 2015 or 2016 (thanks to artists like DJ Yung Vamp, 6-6-6, Soudiere, Mythic, Negative, kloudbug, myrror, and many more). Vaporphonk shared very similar characteristics to Retro and Vaportrap, but the beats were usually slower, and sampled jazz more than videogame music as the main sample. Reverbed snares, loud kicks, sometimes character chants or grunts as voxes, etc. Vaporphonk usually had a lower BPM too. A good example of VaporPhonk (mixed with a bit of traditional phonk at the time) is Trappin in Heaven 2, by Emotional Tokyo. Has a whole track list if you want to dive deeper. SadTrap was one of the later genres to spawn from Trillwave (note that these subgenres aren't in chronological order). SadTrap is best described as emo music, but with loud kicks and snares... that's as far as the hole goes. Sampling a variety of stuff from indie artists (Imogen Heap, Gemma Hayes, Stumbleine, etc). The style was kind of birthed out of nowhere. Sure, Lil B used sad beats back in the early 2010s, using beats that sampled Imogen Heap in particular, but it was entirely different this time through. Loud kicks, loud snares with snare rolls, long intros, cinematic transitions from intros, beat drop to outros, etc. As mentioned, this subgenre kinda just spawned sometime in late 2015 to 2016. It still lives on today, just in a different form (usually not as \"trap\" focused). Some of the most well known Sad Trap artists are GIN$ENG, Longlost, Safari, tothegood, 93FEETOFSMOKE, Velvetears. Once again, just to name a handful. HolyTrap was a pretty early subgenre to be spawned from Trillwave, it wasn't even known as Holytrap to some, just \"top tier Trillwave\". HolyTrap was spawned in 2013 (roughly). It featured a heavier focus on ambient samples, or \"wavy\" samples. Reverb hihats with insane patterns, panning, pitch, etc. Lots of snare rolls, loud mixing, etc. The root was very much still Trillwave, but more mystified. Some early producers who pioneered and innovated the subgenre were Rejjie Hype, MISOGI, Night Lovell (known as KLNV at the time, before he started to rap), BLVC SVND, Cight, Falco, Greg, Lil Netzero, HYDRO, the list goes on. This was a pretty popular subgenre at the time, and the visuals play a big role too. Wave is a pretty vague term, Wave music is very similar to Holytrap, but this time it's just.. amplified. 10x more atmosphere (and reverb). Lilac, Safari, Resonance were some of the most well known wave artists when it was at its peak; there isn't much to say about it. Grew in popularity in 2015 to 2016, died sometime in 2018, although people still make Wave music here and there. Wave music usually used anime girl covers or architecture (as mentioned above in the Visuals part). TrapMetal is very much bordering being a subgenre of Trillwave. TrapMetal features loud beats, with dark samples (sometimes even rock or metal samples, if you couldn't guess from the name), with loud snares, kicks, hihats, and on top of that - loud vocals). BLVC SVND, an OG HolyTrap artist, went on to join Midnight Society, and be a pretty big TrapMetal artist. the same goes for Original God, who started out being a mix of retro, and plain ol Trillwave.  They both now focus more on pure rock and metal music, steering away from trap music. Without a doubt, the #1 influence that came from TrapMetal was XXXTentacion, who started out rapping on HolyTrap and Retro beats, with a raw, trill style. TrapMetal is more or less alive today, but not mainstream in the slightest. Before we move on, it's important to note; THESE ALL CAN COMBINE (within reason) trill rap talking about corrupt cops, hood struggle, or the issue of gang violence on top of videogame sampled beats are not now Trillretro or trilltro, it's simply Trillwave. The subgenres exist to make your life easier to find the specific sound you want, artists are not locked into forever being a SadTrap, Trapmetal, Nerdcore, or Retro artist. Most (not all) of the OG producers who helped shaped the trillwave scene (Lofi+Vaporwave too)! Higher resolution images (as well as more information) can be found HERE.

Due to its popularity in the 2000s there is overlap with common McBling design cues such as shades of pink and black, as well as zebra prints.

The style is characterized by warm and soothing themes and colors drawn mostly from natural elements such as the sea, sky, and vegetation (plants, fruits, flowers, etc). Hues may be deep and rich or may fall on the lighter, brighter side. Tropical aesthetics are usually inspired by a tropical island, the beach, salty life, simple living and bohemian living. The clothes are usually beach friendly, mostly white clothes to help with the heat of the sun, beige colors, green and brown. This (currently) small aesthetic is closely related to Nautical and Bohemian. The principles are inspired by survivalism and eco-friendly life.  It includes elements of tropical culture, such as the stilt houses of traditional Southeast Asian architecture. Tropical fashion can go in any multitude of directions, but it's generally agreed upon that Tropical clothing is usually very lightweight and breezy. For younger people, there might be a nod towards the Surfer look, such as oversized t-shirts, beach waves, beach bags, and a carefree attitude. These characteristics also tie into stereotypical surfer vibes, which are a large sum of the origin of this aesthetic. Many women may opt for swimsuits or bikinis or even wetsuits if they are also surfers. For the more well-to-do, there is Resort wear (also known as cruise wear) is a fashion style that was initially only for customers of affluence who would travel abroad around Christmas and New Year's to warmer climates, but has since become a more common fashion aesthetic with the increase of both volume and accessibility in air travel. Resort wear is signified by its lightweight material, ease of cleaning, and don't need to be ironed at all. The look of resort wear can include a Nautical theme, Hawaiian prints, Mediterranean colors, and overall bright floral patterns combined with oversized hats, sunglasses, swimsuits, and open-toed shoes. Despite the ease of access to Resort wear for regular people, it can still be a signifier of relaxation, affluence, appreciation of nature, and a sharp sense of style. Even though there are stores that specialize in Resort wear (like Banana Republic, J. Crew, and Tommy Bahama), individual fashion houses will still create Resort wear lines in their individual collections (like Chanel, Prada, Marc Jacobs, and Michael Kors). For older men, there is the Vacation Dadcore aesthetic, while older women may identify with the Coastal Grandma lifestyle. Like its visual elements, the fashion of the tropical aesthetic is also inspired by traditional culture. For example, the flower necklaces commonly worn in the aesthetic are Lei that originated from Austronesian people. Common clothing elements from Tropical aesthetics include: The decor is based on found things on the beach and seashells among other \"castaway\" related things: Usually, Tropical-related activities revolved around the beach and the ocean, collecting things and being in the sunshine Tropical visuals are strongly featured in movies such as The Blue Lagoon, Nim's Island, Castaway, and Moana.

It was originally coined in the 2000s, to describe a satirical genre that criticized the predominant US-centric and Eurocentric views of the sci-fi genre. It encompasses various different views, criticisms and references, as Brazil is a vast and populated country, and its regions vary greatly from each other in traditions, local cultures, regional lingos and history.  Although the movement has known origins since the 30s, with the novel O Colecionador de Mãos (The Hand Collector), by Jeronymo Monteiro, and having multiple representatives through the 20th century, it was mostly considered a cult and underground genre, until its surge in popularity thanks to the widespread reach of information of the internet in the 2000s and 2010s.

It tends to borrow heavily from Animecore (especially more feminine anime like Sailor Moon and Fruits Basket), Scene, and Old Web (while also taking some fashion cues from the McBling aesthetic that this was inspired by). Its aesthetic is centered around the preadolescent period of the ages of 10 to 14, so while there is certainly a lot of pink involved (like you'd expect from Kidcore for girls), it's a slightly refined usage of the color pink. There's also an emphasis on Disney sitcoms like Hannah Montana and the Disney Princess lineup as well. It is similar to Bubblegum Coquette. Tweencore aesthetics involve lots of pinks and purples, pretty anime girls, old internet messengers from a bygone era (especially MSN Messenger and AIM), Disney princesses, and a developing rebellious spirit. One may also see Boy Band/Pop Princess/teen idol images pop up in the Tweencore aesthetic as well. For the Tweencore aesthetic, more feminine styles had flower, rainbow, butterflies and heart graphics and patterns alongside quotes.

With 2000s fashion making a return, Netflix introducing the Twilight franchise to their platform at the time, the weather progressing into winter, and the aforementioned nostalgia coincided perfectly and created what we now know as Twilightcore. Twilightcore has muted colors and dark hues. The aesthetic is meant to have romanticized overcast scenes and desaturated clothing.

This aesthetic gives off colorful and playful vibes, similar to Lil Girl and Yume Kawaii although it can also give off more mature and ethereal vibes depending on how it is done. This aesthetic got slightly popular with younger children and teens from the 2010s to today. One of the most iconic things from this aesthetic was the viral Unicorn Frappuccino, which was available at Starbucks for only a few days in April 2017. This aesthetic can help spread positivity as well. Unicorncore also encompasses magic, purity, pride, diversity, freedom, innocence, healing, positivity, joy, and hope. Although the Japanese aesthetic Yumekawa and its offshoot Fairykei use a similar color palette and often feature unicorn motifs, they are still their own individual aesthetics which shouldn’t be confused with the western Unicorncore aesthetic. The aesthetic usually incorporates finding unicorns, magic books, and myths about unicorns. Magic can play a fun part in Unicorncore, as Unicorns are mythical and magical creatures. People who like this aesthetic tend to love quiet spaces, magical areas, nature, flowers, rainbow paths, and trees. Related visuals and interests are reading, bright colors, glitter, sparkles, and flowers. Most visuals consist of sparkles, glitter, and anything else relating to the average unicorn visual. Colors like purple, pink, white gold, and rainbow(especially pastel rainbow colors) merge with these visuals to create the unicorncore aesthetic. Virtually every unicorn core aesthetic picture has a unicorn in it, showing the purpose of the aesthetic. Different subgenres can show different visuals too, like Grunge Unicorn*, which mixes darker colors like black and grey with average unicorncore colors (i.e. white, pink, and rainbow). A unicorn can also appear in these sub-visuals, be it a drawing, mask or altered image fitting the grunge visual. You can learn more about these sub-visuals in the sub-genre section. Unicorncore fashion can be very colorful and fun, full of sequins and glitter. Many younger children have this fashion style, but any age is fine! Accessories are an iconic part of Unicorncore fashion, adding a touch of fun and magic to your outfit. These include: Pop artists and Kawaii music fit into the colorful and cute side of Unicorncore, while EDM, Disco and Lofi fit the more galaxy Unicorncore side. Since the Unicorn is a folk myth, Folk music fits into this aesthetic as well. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

It is characterized by fantasious  characters and concepts placed in a real world urban setting. Urban Fantasy may be set in an approximation of our world in which the fantastic exists secretly or in a world (such as an alternative history) in which it occurs openly (or some combination of the above). Elements such as magic, paranormal beings, other worlds and so on, may exist here. Common themes include coexistence or conflict between humans and other beings, and the changes such characters and events bring to local life[1] The term began to come into its present use in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This development is apparent in the increased use of the term in contemporary reviews. Terri Windling's shared Borderlands universe, made up of a number of anthologies and novels, launched with the eponymous paperback original anthology, Borderland in 1986, followed up by Bordertown, also in 1986. The series was later touted by Neil Gaiman as \"one of the most important places where Urban Fantasy began\". An article in Tor.com has stated that \"some say, Urban Fantasy was born in Bordertown,\" which provided \"young, beginning writers like Charles de Lint and Emma Bull\" with a platform. Emma Bull's unrelated 1987 urban fantasy War for the Oaks, where fairy factions battle in present-day Minneapolis, also received interest and attention. Both Bull's novel and the Borderlands books emphasized young, poor, hip protagonists. In this, they had much in common with the usual protagonist of the cyberpunk sub-genre of science fiction. Sweet Silver Blues a 1987 novel by fantasy author Glen Cook began his Garrett P.I. series. These chronicled the adventures of a hardboiled detective in a fantasy world. Shadowrun, a tabletop RPG with a similar concept to the Borderlands universe appeared. Like those earlier books, Shadowrun took place in a future Earth setting (specifically 2050, in the first edition), after the reappearance of supernatural powers and beings. Players could play humans (cybernetically enhanced or otherwise), elves, dwarves or orcs, all in a dark high tech setting. The more definitely cyberpunk approach (jaundiced and gritty) of the game's universe exerted its own influence.[2] Typically cities in the modern world are common, but they may also be in an alternate world or universe, or smaller town, and can have elements such as: The fashion of Urban fantasy is much like the fashion of Urbancore, streetwear, or just modern clothing, but all mixed with fantasy elements. This could be a simple pair of jeans, and a T-shirt, but with fairy wings, a crown, and glitter make-up. Under Construction",

Urbancore is associated to real-life, modern-day society and almost always is based in recent decades. As it is a really broad aesthetic, it can revolve around city streets and architecture, graffiti, skate parks at night, urban fashion and picnics. Similar to High School Dream, this aesthetic embodies a youthful and somewhat rebellious spirit of a teen living in a nostalgic time. As expected, Urbancore aesthetics focus heavily on the city and city life. Urbancore fashion draws heavily from Skater, Art Hoe, Hip-Hop and Nostalgiacore fashion, since this aesthetic is fairly active, a lot of the clothing is fashionable and breathable. A very particular kind of Urbancore fashion, Streetwear, is a style of casual clothing which became global in the 1990s. It grew from Californian surf and skate culture to encompass elements of sportswear, hip-hop, punk and Japanese street fashion and continued to grow and evolve from there. This style can also be closely related to the Baddie aesthetic, which gravitates to brands like Nike, Jordan, and Louis Vuttion. This style includes: Some Urbancore staples are: Also popular in Urbancore is Techwear, clothing that serves a functionality other than acting as a body covering. This may include waterproofing or extra pockets. Its main influence is cyberpunk and the colour palette is often monochromatic. Techwear elements can include: Hypebeasts are those, usually male, who collect limited-edition streetwear labels like Supreme, Palace, BAPE, Off-White and Yeezy. The clothes they buy are not defined really by their price, but mainly by their rarity. Because of such a high demand for limited edition items by some streetwear brands, retailers employ bouncers to manage crowds who are prepared to queue on the street for hours to buy the latest thing. Because of this demand, there is also an online market of reselling hypebeast stuff. Hypebeasts usually wear clothing items that people would consider \"drip\". This style is somewhat looked down on in the fashion community because of its \"big logo + hype shoes = fashion\" mentality. This look can include: Urbancore music, previously referred to as \"urban contemporary music,\" is mainly Hip-Hop-oriented, though it has roots in Jazz, Funk, and Disco. Many genres of African-American, Caribbean, and Hispanic-American music fell under the \"urban\" category, such as EDM, Freestyle, Gangsta Rap, House, Metal, Pop Rap, Quiet Storm, R&B, Reggae, Reggaetón, Rock, and other forms of genre-bending music full of cross-pollination and creative experimentation. However, the use of \"urban\" as a music category has waned since the early 2020s following the murder of George Floyd. Previously, artists such as Tyler the Creator advocated for alternative names, as \"urban\" held derogatory and racist connotations towards Black and Latino Americans. There are several subgenres and radio formats within Urbancore music, such as Adult R&B, previously known as \"urban adult contemporary,\" and Rhythmic Contemporary. Adult R&B primarily encompasses older genres such as Traditional and Contemporary R&B, Disco, Soul, New Jack Swing, Old-School Hip-Hop, and Funk. It has a relaxed, sophisticated tone with similar feelings to a late-night drive. By contrast, Rhythmic Contemporary is more upbeat, including genres such as EDM and Pop.

It started in the late 1990s with ads such as Comedy Central bumpers.[1] Unlike McBling, UrBling focused less on the \"bling\" aspect and more focused on urban, grungier motifs. The result is a melting pot of elements from Graffiti Pop, Corporate Grunge and other sources, such as Kustom Kulture. These include silhouetted streetlights, power lines, buildings, highways, wings, crests, flames, tribal tattoo-looking motifs, paint splatters/drips, and sepia, red, yellow, and/or orange tones, blacks and greys, slab sans-serifs, graffiti and stencil motifs and fonts, gothic fonts, and more, yet still retains the core values of the McBling aesthetic with its maximalism and visual excess. UrBling can be considered a more \"masculine\" version of the McBling aesthetic. It was also associated with camouflage patterns and the military to some degree, as seen with characters like Hayner from Kingdom Hearts II, likely because of the massive cultural significance in the 2000s of the wars in the Middle East. It was also associated with rap and alt-rock, music genres that were very popular in the 2000s, and also advanced technology, as seen in media like Homestuck and Orion's Arm. UrBling could be seen as a 2000s version of punk heavily revolving around the United States of America and various trends in large cities in the country. The aesthetic also overlapped with Frutiger Metro and the more timeless Urbancore. Comedy Central late 90s bumpers UrBling was the aesthetic of choice for many popular AAA or AA games in the 2000s. Homestuck does not have much in common with the other media using UrBling. However, given its eclectic soundtrack that includes instrumental songs inspired by rap and focus on cities and the military in some arcs, it does have some elements in common with them. It was also inspired by Problem Sleuth and And It Don't Stop, media that parodied 2000s American inner city culture in a cartoony way.",

The goal of Vacation Dadcore is to help you relax and enjoy some chill times in this crazy world. So why don't you take the Dadcore pill and unwind and let loose? The visual aesthetics of Vacation Dadcore are heavily influenced by the Miami Beach movement of 1974, which is mainly known for sweet moustaches, funky shirts, golden sand and blue waves. The Miami Beach movement inspired a generation of '70s kids who refused to let the style die, and they brought it back in the '90s, incorporating socks and sandals but toning down the bright color palette to earth tones. In keeping with the beach theme, Vacation Dadcore conjures up images of beautiful blue oceans, wide sandy beaches, and thatched-roof huts selling boozy drinks at 10 am. You may think it's just palm trees swaying in the breeze, and cruise-liners dotting the horizon, but for those who like to mix things up, late-night bowling alleys, diners, arcades and loads of other places can give off those retro vacation vibes. The iconic visual of a Vacation Dadcore outfit includes a brightly-colored Hawaiian shirt, a tan that puts hotdogs to shame, and a seriously thick moustache that adds even more sex appeal. Overall, Vacation Dadcore embraces all things kitsch, nostalgic, and relaxed – it's the perfect style for those who want to escape to a simpler time without sacrificing any of the fun. Other popular Vacation Dadcore vibes include: This laid-back, retro look is all about channeling your inner 70s detective lounging poolside with their seventh piña colada in hand.

To fully embrace this trend, think of classic vacation destinations such as Palm Springs, Maui, or Miami.

They wear clothes similar to the Gothic theme, which is why 'vampire' is a derogatory term for goths; however, goths have reclaimed vampiric fashion styles as a part of their aesthetic or even as another aesthetic entirely. Vampires originated in the Slavic folklore of the Balkans. Often being associated with the region of Transylvania, today located in Romania, the origins of Vampire folklore can be traced back to multiple Balkan countries, including Serbia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania. The myth of Vampires later spreaded to the rest of Europe. However, they were not the same as what we think of as the vampire today. The most famous vampire story is Dracula by Bram Stoker, where many of the tropes and symbols - such as bats, capes, and fangs - associated with vampires today originated. The idea of vampire hunters, also called slayers, is intertwined with the vampire myth. Garlic, holy water, crucifixes, and wooden stakes are all said to be tools capable of injuring or killing a vampire. Vampires are also commonly said to be not visible in mirrors. In older vampire stories, most vampires were male and seduced much younger human women into becoming vampires. In more modern vampire fiction, vampires can be of any gender, with female vampires just as capable of seducing men. Child vampires are extremely rare, and when they do exist they are usually the child of an adult vampire and not a human child who was turned. Vampire literature spans back hundreds of years, from the era of Bram Stoker's Dracula to the Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles to the ever-controversial Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer.  Seeing as the Vampire trope was born of the written word, it would naturally tie close to literature, and there would be many interpretations of vampires over the years.  An example of this with lesbian subtext is the 1872 novella Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu. Created in 1991, Vampire: The Masquerade is a tabletop role-playing game set in a gothic-punk version of our world, in which vampires are the main protagonists. Focusing on elements of personal horror, the vampires quest to balance their predator and immortal nature with their humanity, the game explores themes of morality, humanity and sanity in a world of supernatural, political and personal dangers. The game brought a more modern and deeper twist on the myth of the vampire, creatures of old in a world growing colder and bleaker. Several versions of the game have been published, including Vampire: The Dark Ages, set in the 1200s and Victorian Age: Vampire, set in the late 1800s, as well as video-games, such as Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines or Vampire: The Masquerade - Coteries of New York. Vampire visuals will often play upon the predator/prey dynamic often associated with Vampire stories, with the \"predator\" often being the one engaging in the Vampire aesthetic while the \"prey\" is a more innocent, childlike person accompanying the person who engages in the aesthetic. Specific visuals, to name a few of them, are: Vampire fashion is influenced by the styles of 17th and 18th century as well as the Victorian era. Vampires tend to dress in clothes from the era when they were turned and look elegant but somewhat out of time. It can include any combination of the following: Vampire music refers to music lyrically about vampires or simply music with dark themes, which includes Baroque rock, Dark Ambient music, Industrial, Goth, classic rock, metal, classical, and anything that conveys a dark, edgy, moody atmosphere. Vampire lifestyle is a term for a contemporary subculture of people, largely within the Goth subculture, who consume the blood of others as a pastime; drawing from the rich recent history of popular culture related to cult symbolism, horror films, the fiction of Anne Rice, and the styles of Victorian England. Active vampirism within the vampire subculture includes both blood-related vampirism, commonly referred to as sanguine vampirism, and psychic vampirism, or supposed feeding from pranic energy. Vampirism and the vampire lifestyle also represent a relevant part of modern day's occultist movements. The mythos of the vampire, his magical qualities, allure, and predatory archetype express a strong symbolism that can be used in ritual, energy work, and magic, and can even be adopted as a spiritual system. The vampire has been part of the occult society in Europe for centuries and has spread into the American subculture as well for more than a decade, being strongly influenced by and mixed with the Neo-Gothic aesthetics.[1] All the neck biting associated with vampires has led to vampire themed kinks and erotica. Many popular Tumblr textposts about vampires make humorous references to the sexiness of biting. Posts about finding vampire boyfriends and girlfriends by knocking on the door of an ancient castle during a rainstorm are also popular.

It embodies a lifestyle and visual aesthetic characterized by simplicity, nostalgia, and a gentle, feminine appeal.\nThe aesthetic is characterized by a minimalist style that revolves around wearing predominantly white and cream shades. This aesthetic extends beyond fashion and encompasses a whole lifestyle focused on comfort and luxury. The trend embraces neutral palette wardrobe essentials, barely-there makeup looks, scented candles, and cozy bedding. The aim is to achieve a natural, yet styled and minimalistic appearance. When executed effectively, the simplistic look can have a transformative effect, as exemplified by the styling in Netflix's \"The Watcher\", particularly with Naomi Watts' character, Nora Brannock. The \"Vanilla Girl\" aesthetic is a style that gained popularity on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, characterized by a soft, natural, and effortless look. It emerged around the mid-2010s but gained significant traction in the late 2010s and early 2020s. The aesthetic draws inspiration from simplicity, femininity, and a nostalgic vibe, often featuring elements like soft pastel colors, vintage clothing, natural makeup, and a focus on self-care. It embraces a minimalist approach to fashion, often incorporating basic wardrobe staples like white tops, denim jeans, flowy dresses, and cozy knitwear. The term \"Vanilla Girl\" comes from the idea of embracing a plain or basic lifestyle that's grounded in classic tastes. It's about finding beauty in simplicity and cultivating a sense of comfort and ease in one's appearance and surroundings. This aesthetic emphasizes a down-to-earth, relatable image, promoting a wholesome and approachable vibe. Social media influencers and content creators played a significant role in popularizing this aesthetic by curating visually appealing content that resonated with many young people seeking a more relaxed and natural style. It continues to evolve with new trends and variations while remaining rooted in its core values of simplicity, natural beauty, and a laid-back attitude. The \"Vanilla Girl\" aesthetic, despite its popularity, has faced some criticism: Criticism of the \"Vanilla Girl\" aesthetic often revolves around its potential to exclude diversity, reinforce stereotypes, and contribute to materialistic ideals that might not align with everyone's values or experiences.

Characterized by its nostalgic and surreal atmosphere, Vaporwave blends electronic music with chopped and screwed and samples, while also featuring a distinct visual style that pays homage to bygone eras of popular culture (typically the Memphis Design, Y2K Futurism, and more recently Frutiger Aero eras). Vaporwave has been interpreted by many as being a criticism/parody of corporate aesthetics and capitalism,[1] though others disagree and instead see it as a celebration of these aesthetics.[2] The genre is not merely a musical experience but rather a cultural commentary on the rapid pace of technological advancement and the commodification of the past. The genre emerged in 2011 from online communities, such as Turntable.fm. In subsequent years, it gained popularity through websites such as Bandcamp, Soundcloud, Tumblr, Last.fm, 4chan, and YouTube. Its rise in popularity coincided with the decline of Seapunk and while the two certainly share similar aesthetic choices, there is a distinct difference between the two. The key difference between Seapunk and Vaporwave is that Seapunk had a much more focused aesthetic on early '90s CG images and aquatic life. On the other hand, Vaporwave cast a broader net on its aesthetic cues, choosing to highlight the period from the 1970s to early 2000s (crossing over somewhat with the Y2K Futurism aesthetics of 1997—2004). It is debated when the period that Vaporwave is centered around ended; some mark the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks as the ending point, while others mark the Great Recession of 2008 as the end point. Since 2022, Frutiger Aero aesthetics of 2004—2013 have started to make their way into the Vaporwave scene, which would make the cutoff point 2012—2013 when smartphones and Flat Design became fully popular and social media took a different turn. One of the big early inspirations for the Vaporwave visual aesthetic draws direct inspiration from the Memphis Group, a name given to a group of post-modern designers and architects, founded in Milan, Italy by Ettore Sottsass in 1980. The original group disbanded in 1987, but their influence lived on, and Memphis Design peaked in popularity from the late 1980s to early 1990s. By the mid-late 1990s however, it had become seen as a tacky product, and its popularity faded. In the late 2000s/early 2010s, Memphis began to gain appreciation from designers, collectors, and many of those with nostalgia and fond memories of the '80s/early '90s. The bright colors and simple shapes would later inspire media and products aimed at children and youth of the era, in aesthetics such as Memphis Jr. and Factory Pomo. Examples included Nickelodeon, MTV, Pee Wee's Playhouse, Discovery Zone, Gymboree, Trapper Keepers, toys, and many other staples of Kidcore, which given the time period it was popular in, makes it perfect to fit in with the Vaporwave aesthetic, since many early members of the Vaporwave community were kids during the time the Memphis style was popular. Vaporwave has garnered some significant attention from the music press as of late. Most recently, artists such as Vektroid, HKE, Infinity Frequencies, The 2814 Proyect and R23X have gotten covered by music sites and blogs such as The Guardian, Dummy, Fader, FACT, The Wire, Thump (Vice), Red Bull Music Academy, The Quietus, Resident Advisor, TinyMixTapes, Marcel's Music Journal, Cokemachineglow, The Needle Drop, and others. Coincidentally, several Vaporwave zines have started popping up, the most notable of them being Private Suite Magazine. Popular visuals utilized in Vaporwave aesthetics can include, but are not limited, to Anime and cartoons, (often from the '70s to '90s but not always, ie. Sailor Moon, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and even The Simpsons, as popularized by artist Lucian Hughes), drug use (almost always in the form of codeine syrup or lean, or pills), Classical sculptures such as the Apollo Belvedere and Laocoon, Consumerism (often displays brand names and logos, such as Adidas, Pepsi Cola, Microsoft Windows, Macintosh Plus, PlayStation, Arizona Iced Tea, and Fiji Water), computer hardware and graphics from the '80s-early '00s (The Windows 95 operating system is used often in vaporwave artwork and edits, as are images of early computers such as the first of Apple's Macintosh PCs), city skylines, malls, sadness or distress (often employed to emphasize the ironic soullessness of the Vaporwave aesthetic, in a 'sad but aesthetically pleasing' kind of way), Liminal spaces (while on a creepier level, the surreal and nostalgic feeling goes quite well with this aesthetic), grids/lines/shapes (the inclusion of this in particular has led to some confusion with Synthwave aesthetics), pink and teal, altered reality (pictures with unnatural hues and tones can be seen throughout this aesthetic. Heavily edited pictures of the world around you can soon become unrecognizable and foreign), glitches, and the gratuitous use of Japanese, Korean and Chinese characters. Japanese seems to be one of the most used languages in the vaporwave community's artwork. Full width versions of Latin characters, used in Japanese, Korean and Chinese computers, are also commonly seen in the aesthetic. There is an air of ambiguity of whether Vaporwave artists are either celebrating the rampant capitalism that birthed the Vaporwave aesthetics, ironically mocking the hollowness of a lot of these visual cues which mistakes shallowness for depth, or just happens to think they look or sound cool/nostalgic. It is generally left up to the listener as to what they think the artist meant with the final work. Most Vaporwave entertainment seems to be relegated to YouTube series (although that doesn't stop a lot of major corporations to, ironically, co-opt a lot of Vaporwave aesthetics for their marketing campaigns), with series such as Dan Bell's Dead Mall Series and Retail Archeology being prime examples of cataloging what Vaporwave is all about, while SkyCorp Home Video takes the Vaporwave aesthetic and becomes a major pastiche of early '90s entertainment and commercials. The films Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse, Valerian City of a Thousand Planets, and The Wave use the vaporwave aesthetic within their respective worlds and for stylistic and creative narrative. Vaporwave, unsurprisingly, also has a rather strong and thriving presence in video games. Although it's primarily in the independent game space, the two best-known examples of Vaporwave video games are Broken Reality and Mall Quest. Although one can find many examples of Vaporwave gaming on GameJolt to play for free (which is fitting for the general tone Vaporwave goes for). Vaporwave also prominently co-opts video games within the aesthetic as well, as the video game industry was becoming increasingly profitable at the time vaporwave is based around, so the aesthetic often incorporates video games from the time, including the NES, GB, SNES, PS1, GBC, Dreamcast, GBA and occasionally Atari devices. A game frequently referenced in vaporwave is the game Ecco the Dolphin, as well as it's sequels, even inspiring one of the founding albums of the genre, Chuck Person's EccoJams, as well as the song ECCOと悪寒ダイビング by Macintosh Plus, from the famous vaporwave album Floral Shoppe. The music of the game is popular among fans of vaporwave for it's trippy feel and all around vaporwave vibes, and the game is one of the reasons why dolphins are so prevalent in vaporwave imagery. Vaporwave originally started as an offshoot of the genre hypnagogic pop, which was what the founding artists of the genre, such as Daniel Lopatin, Vektroid and James Ferraro were labelled as at the time. The genre was first characterized by its heavy use of samples from the 1980s and 1990s music, typically pop, smooth jazz, or Muzak. Samples are often pitched down, layered, or altered in classic chopped and screwed style. However, vaporwave has started to incorporate more original compositions in a range of directions, from the happy, and faster paced sounds of artists such as Surfing and George Clanton to the more distorted and surreal sounds of artists such as  2 8 1 4  and Nmesh. Artists have also started to get creative with the physical mediums they sell their albums on, ranging from the conventional (vinyl and cassette) to the unusual (Minidiscs, floppy discs and even Game Boy Advanced cartridges). There are so many Vaporwave Music Artists out there that we won't be able to exactly list them off, but we can give you a list of some Vaporwave artists that can serve as an introduction to the genre. Some of these artists include: Due to a lot of similar aesthetic cues, most notably neon grids, palm trees and the famous sunset, to the untrained eye, it's easy to confuse the aesthetics of both Synthwave and Vaporwave (and some people have tried to make politically motivated edits that do, indeed, confuse the two aesthetics and assume they are the same). Let it be known; they are, indeed, two completely separate aesthetics with two completely different goals in mind. While Vaporwave is more political, satirically using consumerist media, including advertisements, products, shopping malls and brand logos, as well as presenting its nostalgia in a way that feels more dreamy or trippy, using faded pastel colours and glitched visuals. It also celebrates the expansion of civilisation, often showing computer graphics of the time[3], and most notably using Japanese visuals, including anime, Japanese text and Japanese music, as Japan was at the forefront of the expansion at the time, experiencing an economic miracle and producing all kinds of technology that was shipped all across the world. Synthwave is more of a genuinely earnest celebration of television, music and video games from the 80's, sometimes mimicking the bad plot lines and awesome visuals, and has a more dramatic colour palette, featuring vibrant neon colours (excluding green) in contrast with dark blues and blacks. This confusion is also not helped due to the fact there have been several instances of Synthwave and Vaporwave artists collaborating on projects and some artists coming in-between the two genres, such as Home and Hotel Pools. In short, Synthwave concentrates on fast-tempo electronic music inspired by the emerging synth scene in the 80's, while Vaporwave concentrates on the ironic use of consumerist media and mass-produced and artificial pop music, but also celebrates nostalgia from the 80s and 90s. Since the music genre was born, Vaporwave has expanded into multiple directions, making it hard for newcomers to fully understand how it is defined. Below, you will find a list of the more well-known subgenres of Vaporwave to help understanding the common traits and differences between them. Within Vaporwave, Broken Transmission stands out as one of the most distinct styles. The music incorporates samples of television commercials, radio jingles, and dialogue clips, and blends them with the typical Vaporwave sound while chopping them up in an erratic manner to evoke the impression of a disrupted transmission. Eccojam is a piece of music usually made from a single short loop of the source material. It is nearly always from the seventies, eighties, or nineties and smothered with effects, most notably reverb and echo. Made popular by Daniel Lopatin (under his Chuck Person alias), many points to this being the very beginning of Vaporwave as we know it, due to a lot of the hallmarks of modern Vaporwave popping up in the Eccojams sound. Subgenre of Vaporwave, which takes elements from another subgenre such as Utopian Virtual created from James Ferraro's album Far Side Virtual, but instead of presenting a retrofuturistic utopia, it presents a much darker and surreal version of this utopia. Still, it is much more optimistic and less ironic than the original Vaporwave. As of the 2020s, it is considered a response to its parent subgenre. Future Funk is one of, if not the largest subgenres of Vaporwave, partially splitting off into its own aesthetic, using Vaporwave-style sampling in its music, and particularly concentrating on Vaporwave's use of Japanese media of the time. While the subgenre originally focused on the funk scene, with the original album of the scene being Saint Pepsi's Hit Vibes, which was almost entirely built upon 80's funk and disco sampling and modern EDM drums and audio effects, the scene took a turn towards sampling Japanese city pop and anime music and a majority of its imagery being taken from vintage anime, usually set in an urban environment, thanks to the musicians Macross 82-99 and Yung Bae. Similar to Mallsoft, Future Visions turn the futuristic atmosphere of Vaporwave into a real experience. The \"vision\" is taken literal, as future visions stands out as one of the more visual expressions within the Vaporwave genre. Different to other subgenres, it heavily relies on ambient textures, resulting in a fusion of hypnagogic drift and utopian styles. With a predominant use of synthesizers and dreamy elements, Future Visions is distinctly characterized by its dominant Cyberpunk themes. Hypnagogic Drift, among the earliest manifestations of Vaporwave, possesses a more dream-like atmosphere compared to other subgenres. It created a drifting feeling by using unconventional samples and sometimes borders on the verge of ambient music. 骨架的 stood out as one of the first artists to create music in this style, but the genre has since continued to evolve. Notably, this subgenre is recognized for its frequent use of weird visuals, aiding the surreal atmosphere of the music. Late Night Lo-Fi adopts the practice of sampling from Eccojams and draws inspiration from the 90's retrofuturism found in utopian styles. However, it's very different from it by presenting these influences in a new, apolitical light. This subgenre is primarily focused on evoking the atmosphere of vibrant city nights, infused with a blue feeling. It achieves this by heavily sampling 80's music and smooth jazz, creating a sound that captures the essence of bright lights and the allure of big city evenings. Similar to Faux-Utopian, Mallsoft utilizes the concept of \"virtual plaza\" that is commonly associated with Vaporwave. Its sound is characterized by reverbs and a washed-out quality, creating a dream-like atmosphere that is supposed to emulate the sensation of strolling through a virtual plaza. Additionally, mallsoft shares the concept of a hypercapitalist dream world (or nightmare), connecting it with utopian virtual and faux-utopian genres. One of the first subgenres of Vaporwave, Utopian Virtual is mostly inspired by Jame's Ferraro's 2011 album Far Side Virtual, which used intentionally artificial sounds, such as midi pianos, simple drum patterns and synthesizers, calling to mind a plastic utopian world of the Sims and fashion magazines of the late 20th century. Much of its imagery is inspired by the simple and too-clean textures seen in late 90's and early 00's 3D video games. A satirical genre that criticizes the over-aestheticization of the Vaporwave and also takes the misconception that the typical music is \"easy\" to produce, literal. There's many releases of this type and many people confuse them for real Vaporwave due to their sheer amount. Examples are Dream by bl00dwave and Subliminal Romance Part II by WΔll Flowers. Vaportrap is a type of Vaporwave that incorporates drum beats from trap. The characteristic trap drums include hi-hats with varying note subdivisions, typically between 8th notes, 8th note triplets, 16th notes, and 16th note triplets. Other common characteristics are 808 bass, and medium or slow tempos. Blank Banshee is an example of Vaportrap. VHS Pop is one of the most popular Vaporwave subgenres, being home to some of the most influential Vaporwave musicians, such as Luxury Elite, Surfing, Eyeliner and George Clanton. It generally mimics or samples pop music from the 80's and 90's, though often uses vocal effects and reverb to give the genre the iconic dreamy nostalgia of Vaporwave; though, is still considered one of the more lucid subgenres of Vaporwave.",

These are made by using digital graphic tools, which enables designers to manipulate images and forms, creating a more intricate and blooming-like pattern, similar to Vectorgarden and Frutiger Metro, however, Vectorbloom’s visuals tend to be more mature, and typically not as saturated.

Vectorgarden was popular between the Mid-2000s and Early-2010s, sharing a lot of overlap with Frutiger Aero since they share many of their visual motifs such as humanism, nature, auroras, and glossy textures.

Vectorgarden is characterized by minimalist abstract flourish patterns, flowers, auroras, butterflies, bubbles, as well by the heavy use of gradients, transparent, and glossy textures. Vectorgarden's color scheme typically consists of a bright monochromatic or two-toned color palette, contrasted with white. Vectorgarden was utilized in branding, stock images, and architecture, to give a sense of comfort, lightness, softness, vibrancy, and familiarity. The difference between Vectorgarden and Vectorbloom is that Vectorgarden has a more minimal and soft visual style, while the other aesthetic is visually more complicated and \"psychedelic\".

It is characterized by striking vector shapes, 45- and/or 60-degree diagonal lines, futuristic fonts, and flat, (usually) high contrast colors. The exact origin of the Vectorheart aesthetic is hard to define, but pioneers of the style include design firms such as Bionic Systems and The Designers Republic.[1] Often considered a subgenre of Y2K Futurism and Vectorbloom, Vectorheart grew in popularity during the early-2000s, but went out of fashion in the mainstream in the early-2010s. Since then, it has seen some small resurgence beginning in the late-2010s. It was popular alongside Frutiger Metro, Vectorbloom, Gen X Soft Club, and other aesthetics of the 2000s. The Wipeout series, in which the Designers Republic was involved with for the first three games, is commonly associated with Vectorheart and thus the aesthetic is also occassionally known as Wipeout Design.[2] The exact origin of the Vectorheart aesthetic is hard to define, but pioneers of the style include design firms such as Bionic Systems and The Designers Republic.[1] Vectorheart began to appear in the Late-1990s, often associated with Y2K Futurism due to its sleek, cutting edge style. This style complimented the futurism that Y2K Futurism promoted, leading to a lot of overlap between the two. Vectorheart also strongly resembles Gen X Soft Club, another Y2K subgenre, incorporating the same abstract flourishes and design philosophy. Vectorheart maintained its popularity into the Early-2000s, and the into the Mid-2000s. During the Mid-2000s, other adjacent aesthetics such a Y2K Futurism began to fall into decline. Despite this, Vectorheart maintained its popularity into the 2010s, being popular alongside aesthetics like Frutiger Metro and Vectorbloom. During this time, Vectorheart was used for purposes like advertising, art, web design, magazine covers, and more. Starting at the Early-2010s, Vectorheart saw a considerable decline in its popularity. This was due to design philosophies such as Flat Design becoming mainstream. Flat Design largely omitted the visually complex and cutting edge visuals of Vectorheart for a more simple and easy to understand look. This, combined with other adjacent aesthetics such as Vectorbloom seeing decline, contributed to Vectorheart falling out of mainstream usage and popularity. Vectorheart is characterized by striking vector shapes, 45- and/or 60-degree diagonal lines, futuristic fonts, and flat, (usually) high contrast colors. The style is loosely inspired by Swiss modernism, utilitarian industrial design,[1] brutalism, and to an extent, Peter Saville's album cover designs for Factory Records. The look is considered maximum-minimalist by some, and is often mixed with the typical look of Y2K Futurism, Gen X Soft Club, and Metalheart. Vectorheart's sleek maximum-minimalist design philosophy led to it being popular in depictions of the future, or things that were trying to look futuristic. In addition, many Vectorheart artists, most notably the Designers Republic, often incorporate references to Japanese culture, for example kanji characters and ties to anime-influenced artwork. Vectorheart may also contain themes of anti-establishment and anti-consumerism, and it is not uncommon for Vectorheart artists to include exaggerated depictions of consumer culture, for example the over-abundance of logos, in-your-face advertising and liberal usage of trademark (™) and copyright (© and ®) symbols, as seen in the Wipeout games.

The visual style found within Neo-Vectorheart prioritizes sleek, dynamic designs, often as an homage or pastiche of the work done by the design firms that popularized the original Vectorheart look. During the Late-2010s to the Early-2020s, there has been a resurgence in Vectorheart. This was inspired by similar Neo-Y2K movements going on at the same time. Neo-Vectorheart has come to be embraced by online gamers, it being said to incorporate maximalist \"gamer-grunge\". Neo-Vectorheart is also popular in the realm of logo design. Neo-Vectorheart, similar to Vectorheart, is characterized by striking vector shapes, 45- and/or 60-degree diagonal lines, and futuristic fonts. Neo-Vectorheart is distinguished from regular Vectorheart due to its monochromatic color schemes and less abstract patterns than regular Vectorheart. Black and white are the most commonly found colors in this subgenre, with other colors generally being used as complimentary/accent colors rather than primary ones; this monochromatic motif also works well on logos, one of Neo-Vectorheart's primary categories.

There is a particular focus on mental health, wellness, and taking care of your mind that is not typically present in other academic aesthetic. It encourages open and frank discussions of serious mental health disorders and tries to break down stigma. There is also an element of teaching and the enjoyment of passing on your knowledge as well as increasing it through study. Think of the typical batty science professor, nutty art teacher, and/or kooky literature lecturer. Clothing involves the traditional academia motifs, vintage styles (the 50s lends itself well to this subtype due to the more vibrant colouring) waistcoats, berets, tweed, shirts and blouses, cardigans (bonus points for elbow pads), but in brighter hues. There is a love for big, kitschy costume jewellery. Areas of study can include many topics but literature, art, and psychology as well as other sciences are particular themes. Vibrant Academia intentionally celebrates all learning and all academics, regardless of subject, grades, degree level, educational institute, or background (including class, race, sex, (dis)ability, religion, gender and gender identity, sexuality, etc.). Vibrant Academia film and television is similar to other academia aesthetics, providing that it is not too dark and there is often an element of comedy and a general sense of hope.

Howls moving castle, The Purples Victorian is a visual aesthetic that comprises the various fashions and trends in British culture that emerged and developed in the United Kingdom and the British Empire during the reign of Queen Victoria (1837-1901), which is known as the Victorian Era. The issue and aesthetics of social class often come into play with the Victorian aesthetic, with both visual signs and fictional works discussing the differences between the poor, the working class, the landed gentry, and the bourgeoisie. The conflict between urbanism and a good quality of life is another common point of discussion, as the Industrial Revolution was at its highest peak during this time. The Victorian era is highly popular in historical aesthetics because of its large influence in fiction. Many popular fictional works, such as the Sherlock Holmes series, Charles Dickens' books, the invention of children's literature, and the Bronte sisters' books are seen as timeless, with many people being fascinated by the period because of it. Because of the popularity of these original works, many writers that did not live during this era made fictional works that take place in the period and became popular itself. Likewise, many people are into Victorianism because it is one of the most popular, and thus, accessible, historic fashions; the corsets, wide skirts, and different dressing rituals are very fascinating to modern people, and many articles have been written explaining these practices. Please note that there are many modern interpretations of the Victorian Era; this means that the emphasis will be on the stereotypes of this historical period, often not being historically accurate. The aesthetic heavily influenced Lolita, Steampunk, and Victorian Goth. Victorian visual includes more elegance and vintage vibes, displaying things such as: The Victorian era and the Belle Époque are notorious as being eras or revivals. The main revivals were: Neoclassicism (which revives the aesthetic of Ancient Greece, the Etruscan civilization and Ancient Rome; see Hellenic), the Gothic Revival (which revives the aesthetic of late medieval churches, cathedrals and castles from Western Europe), and the Rococo Revival (which revives the aesthetic of Rococo, a style that dominated the 1st half of the 18th century, highly associated with the court of Louis XV; this is what most people picture when they think of Victorian objects and furniture). Some more obscure revivals were the Romanesque Revival (which revives the aesthetic of late 10th-13th century churches, cathedrals and castles, characterized by thick masonry, massive columns and round arches), the Renaissance Revival (which revives the aesthetic of the 15th and 16th century Renaissance), the Egyptian Revival (which revives the aesthetic of Ancient Egypt) and the Moorish Revival (which revives the aesthetic of the Islamic world). There were revivals of some regional styles, like the Louis XVI style in France and Belgium, the first form of French Neoclassicism, softer and more delicate compared to the Empire style. Despite all these reboots, there were also some original styles: Eclecticism (which mixes styles of the past in an harmonious way, usually the ones based on Classical Antiquity; Beaux Arts architecture is a very good example of this; this is what most people picture when they think of Victorian architecture), and, towards the end of the period, Art Nouveau (a style characterized mainly by curvy lines and the use of motifs based on plants). When it comes to architecture and design, the Victorian era is best known as an era of revivalism. The main styles were Neoclassicism, the Gothic Revival, the Rococo Revival, and Eclecticism (which mixed elements, rules and proportions from multiple aesthetics together). However, this doesn't mean that it was a period of stilistic stagnation. Architects needed creativity for adapting styles of the past to new types of buildings, like stations and factories. The most famous revivalist style of the Victorian period is the Gothic Revival. Britain was the place where this revival appeared first and where it manifested the most. During the mid-18th century, with the rise of Romanticism, an increased interest and awareness of the Middle Ages among influential antiquarians created a more appreciative approach for medieval art, including medieval church and castle architecture. At the beginning of the 19th century, the draughtsman John Carter saw Gothic architecture, with its pointed arches, as Englad's 'National Architecture'. At that time, France recently experiencing a violent revolution, followed by a militarist empire under Napoleon, and Carter wanted to fuse the Gothic with Englishness. From a historically  accurate point of view, this association is inaccurate since Gothic architecture first appeared in France, with the Church of St Denis in 1145. Another admirer was Augustus Welby Pugin, who, among other things, collaborated with Charles Barry at rebuilding the House of Parliment in London, in the Perpendicular Gothic style. In France, Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc restored many prominent medieval landmarks in France, including those which had been damaged or abandoned during the French Revolution. His major restoration projects included Notre-Dame de Paris, the Basilica of Saint Denis, Mont Saint-Michel, Sainte-Chapelle, and the medieval walls of the city of Carcassonne. The idea that architecture might represent the glory of kingdoms can be traced to the dawn of civilisation, but the notion that architecture can bear the stamp of national character is a modern idea, that appeared in 18th century historical thinking. As the map of Europe was in constant change, architecture was used to grant the aura of a glorious past to even the most recent nations. In addition to the credo of universal Classicism, two new, and often contradictory, attitudes on historical styles existed in the early 19th century. Pluralism promoted the simultaneous use of multiples of style, while Revivalism held that a single historical model was appropriate for modern architecture. Associations between styles and building types appeared, for example: Egyptian for prisons, Gothic for churches, or Renaissance Revival for banks and exchanges. These choices were the result of other associations: the pharaohs with death and eternity, the Middle Ages with Christianity, or the Medici family with the rise of banking and modern commerce. Besides revivals, because of the Industrial Revolution and the new technologies it brought, new types of buildings have appeared. By 1850 iron was quite present in dailylife at every scale, from mass-produced decorative architectural details and objects of apartment buildings and commercial buildings to train sheds. A well-known 19th century glass and iron building is the Crystal Palace from Hyde Park (London), built in 1851 to house the Great Exhibition, having an appearance similar with a greenhouse. Its scale was daunting. From furniture to architecture, the Victorian era was a period of historical revivals. The same styles popular in architecture were also popular in design. Multiple palaces, houses and apartment buildings had rooms in certain styles, and so the owners bought furniture that fit with where it was placed in their dwelling. For example, if someone would have a Rococo Revival living-room, they would buy furniture, clocks, tableware and other Rococo Revival objects to fit with that room. Much of the furniture was based on Neoclassicism from the 2nd half of the 18th century, Rococo from the 1st half of the 18th century, Baroque from the 17th century, another styles from the past. In the case of Gothic Revival designs, little medieval furniture had survived, so cabinet-makers and designers drew on the architectural details of Gothic churches and cathedrals, using pointed arches (aka ogives), and even window tracery in their work. Some of the Victorian remakes were more decorated and complex compared to their historic sources of inspiration. Despite revivalism being so prevalent, this doesn't mean that there was no originality in these works. Architects, cabinet-makers other craftsmen, especially during the second half of the 19th century, created mixes of styles, by extracting and interpreting elements specific to certain eras and areas. This practice is known as eclecticism. This stylistic development occurred during a period when the competition of World's Fairs motivated many countries to invent new industrial methods of creation. When it comes to materials, many Victorian objects are made of silver, bronze, brass or gilt bronze. This is why one of the colours which is really associated with this aesthetic is gold. During the 19th century, upper class and wealthy families liked to decorate their homes with porcelain figurines, which were usually really colorful, and to put grandious sets comprised of two candlesticks and a clock between them, on their fireplaces. Usually, there were also wall mirrors with gilt frames above these fireplaces. The most art popular during the Victorian era was Academic art. This is what was taught in official European art schools. Paintings of this type are hyper realistic, the picture plane treated as a window onto a scene, and often depict important moments: scenes from Greco-Roman mythology, Christianity or just historic moments. Some Victorian era painters that were seen as the greatest at their time were: Ernest Meissonier,  William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Jean-Léon Gérôme, Alexandre Cabanel, and Lawrence Alma-Tadema. A sub genre of Victorian Academic was Orientalism, which consisted of depictions of life in the Islamic world. These paintings often depicted European women in eroticized islamic contexts. At the beginning of the Victorian period, Neoclassicism (circa 1750-1850) was the dominant movement. Inspired by the excavations of the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum from 1748, a renewed interest in the arts of Greco-Roman antiquity occurred. It was popular mainly in the 2nd half of the 18th century, and the first decades of the 19th. The style also manifested in architecture and decorative arts, many buildings that look like white Ancient Greek or Roman temples being Neoclassical. Just like ancient art, Neoclassical paintings and sculptures are characterised by calmness and restraint, being focused on heroic themes, expressing noble notions like noble sacrifice. Still at the beginning of the Victorian era, Romanticism (circa 1790-1880) focused on imagination and emotions. It grew from a disillusionment with the Enlightenment's values of reason and order after the 1789 French Revolution. It emerged partly as a reaction against Neoclassicism, and emphasised passion, sentiments and individuality over detachment and rationality. Romantics also appreciated the power of nature, like how it can be seen in Caspar David Friedrich's paintings, some artworks being similar with present-day aesthetics like Dark Paradise or Dark Naturalism. In architecture and decorative arts, the movement gave birth to the Gothic Revival style, a certain nostalgia for the Middle Ages appearing in the 1820s and 1830s. The Gothic Revival appeared before the Victorian period, in the mid 18th century, in houses of a number of wealthy and politically influential antiquarians, at the beginning in England. An early example is Strawberry Hill, Twickenham, London, by Horace Walpole, begun in 1749. German Romantic writers and architects were the first that promoted the Gothic style as a expression of the national character. This was a form of rebellion against Neoclassicism, the status quo style at the beginning of the 19th century. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (usually known simply as just Goethe), a German Romantic poet, was an admirer of the Gothic style of medieval cathedral. In music, the movement is best known though the works of Frédéric Chopin, like Douze études, Op 25: No 1 in A-Flat Major \"Aeolian Harp\"; Nocturnes, Op. 9: No. 1 in B-Flat Minor; or Nocturne Op. 9: No. 2. Later, in the mid-19th century, Realism (circa 1830-1890) appeared. Compared to artworks from until this period, artists depicted nobles and historic scenes, completely ignoring the poor and their lives. Particularly in France after the 1848 Revolution, several young artists wanted to paint reality directly as they saw it, often showing the social inequality of the Victorian period. Realists reacted against the perceived excesses and self-indulgence of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, and the artificiality of academic art. The most iconic Realist artworks are the ones that show peasants working. Out of all the art movements of the Victorian era, Impressionism (circa 1865-1885) is the most famous one today. Back then, it was obscure and Impressionist paintings were mocked by art critics. Evolving partly from Realism and partly from Dutch and English landscapists, the Impressionists aimed to break away from the dominance and rigidity of the official art academies. The style is relatively easily reicognoscible through its rapid sketchy strokes. The main subjects of Impressionist paintings are landscapes and everyday scenes, featuring ordinary people. Many artists of this movement painted in the open air. Later, Post-Impressionism (circa 1885-1910) emerged, still an obscure movement at its time. It encompasses several styles used by artists who followed Impressionism and explored new, colourful approaches. Painters explored optical effects and sometimes analyzed the structure of objects, each having an unique approach. At the very end of the Victorian period, Art Nouveau (circa 1890-1910) appeared. It was an art and design movement, that had different versions in multiple countries. It was an attempt of creating a new style that fit the vibe of the late 19th-very early 20th century. Compared to Realism, Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, Art Nouveau also manifested in design and architecture, besides painting and sculpture. The style is known best for the use of sinuous whiplash lines and motifs based on plants and insects. The taste of Europeans for Japanese art was one of the key factors that led to the emergence of the movement. Multiple artists who worked in this style had collections of Japanese art in their homes, being basically weebs. Art Nouveau posters were particularly influenced by Japanese woodblock prints, featuring blank colours and faded earthy colours, like olive green, and also visible outlines. Victorian homes were cluttered and full of knick-knacks. Note: Victorian fashion was often changing (e.g. the fashionable female silhouette completely changed from the 1850s to the 1870s). Hence, it is impossible to give one particular Victorian look, and instead, one can choose to follow the fashion of a particular part of the Victorian era, or mix and match. After WW1, styles of the previous eras, including the aesthetics of the Victorian period, were seen as \"dated\" or \"passé\". The complex ornaments of all the 19th century styles were replaced by geometric shapes and abstracted motifs, or just simple blank surfaces, in Art Deco, Bauhaus and mid-century design. Despite using simpler and angular shapes, many Art Deco buildings, especially those from the 1920s, are elegant and refined. After all, Art Deco was a style of luxury, refinement and modernity. Still during the interwar period, at the Bauhaus, a German art school, designs characterized by a lack of ornamentation and Modernity were created, all with a machine aesthetic. Today, for us they look basic and maybe ordinary, but at the time when they were created, these designs were revolutionary. Comparing the aesthetics of the 19th century with those of the 20th, you may find Modernist designs bland or banal. However, just because an outfit, an artwork or a design is simple, it doesn't necessarily mean that its worse than a more ornate one. Minimalism and Maximalism can be done well or poorly. Each style is beautiful in its own unique way. Later, during the late 2000s, the 2010s and the 2020, due to the interest for vintage stuff and the appreciation of young generation for styles of the past, new  objects were and are produced in styles of the Victorian era. This present-day revival was particularly popular in frames and porcelain, since most frames and tableware that try to look \"vintage\" or \"old\" are Neo-Rococo, one of the most important styles of the Victorian period. Some music videos or high-fashion outfits also make references to the era. Usually, when people think of the 19th century today, they think of it as a dark and gloomy period, like Dark Academia, with people dressed in black and stuff. In reality, a big of Victorian fashion was actually in light and bright colours, especially in France when fashion designers made tributes to the Rococo style. During the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, multiple Victorian-inspired aesthetics appeared, the most famous being Steampunk. Some present-dat artists also take inspiration from the art of the mid and late 19th century. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

It was popular in its time, in art, photography and literature. This was partially because rich Victorians had a bit of an obsession with the underclass and the way they lived, and their view somewhat persists even today. While this aesthetic is not always totally truthful to the way the poor lived at this time, it does offer a window into the period from a certain perspective. The Victorian era lasted from 1837 to 1901, the duration of the reign of Queen Victoria. Her reign was the longest of any British monarch up to that point, at 64 years. A lot changed during that time, so \"Victorian\" should be regarded as a blanket term as opposed to a single specific aesthetic. Aesthetics, or a set of principles concerned with beauty and art, were very important to Victorian artists and scholars. They liked to separate things into neat categories and look at them one facet at a time. Art and aesthetics, to rich Victorians, were not only influenced by real life, but also influenced life in a way. They saw the poor and the places where they lived and worked not as they were, but as artists depicted them and their facet of city life. That is, fundamentally different from them, and to be pitied. In the simplest terms, the Victorians knew they were living in an important time, and made sure people long into the future knew it as well. Their view of the world continues to bleed into the modern culture of English-speaking countries, and continues to somewhat distort our modern view of history. This becomes very obvious through art of the time, including art about the poor. While depictions of the underclass were not new to British art in the 19th Century, the rise of photography and the novel during and after the Industrial Revolution created somewhat of a perfect storm for the Victorians' literary obsession with the poor. The Victorian Urban Poverty aesthetic can be said to have begun as early as 1837, with the start of Queen Victoria's reign and the publishing of the first installment of Oliver Twist in the magazine Bentley's Miscellany. The Victorian era was the first to be documented through the medium of photography, which came around in the 1930s. Because of this, the era is very well-documented, leaving little room for the visual aesthetic elements to change. These visuals include, obviously, urban poverty, especially in London, beggars and the homeless, slums and slumming (a practice wherein rich women would go to poor neighborhoods and offer alms), factories, poorhouses and workhouses, sick and dying people, prostitution and crime, and waifish women and children. It can be said that this aesthetic glamorizes poverty, exploitation, disease, and violence against women. In truth, this aesthetic has always been glamorized to some extent. Rich Victorians were even guilty of this in their own time. It must be emphasized that while the Victorian era was a time of great economic, technological, and societal progress, it was also rife with class inequality, racism, sexism, all manner of violence, colonialism, and human trafficking. Slavery was still allowed in much of the world, including in the the United States until the 1860s, there was constant war, and many common diseases were still poorly understood. This aesthetic is indicative of a lot of social issues of the Victorian era (some of which persist), and it should be viewed as such. Also, this is as good a time as any to mention that on its own, poverty is not an aesthetic.  It is a motif in many valid aesthetics but on its own, not only it is too broad to be an aesthetic, but making it one is obviously disrespectful. Victorian Urban Poverty is connected to a distinct era and a distinct place, and it influenced a distinct genre of art. That is what makes it an aesthetic. Victorian urban poverty, the aesthetic and the historical reality, should not be romanticized, and should instead be used to better understand how people of the past lived and to aid in creating realistic settings.

It involves the embracing of taboo emotions such as hatred and anger, and topics like gore and violence. Violencecore visuals depict hatred and vitriol, so colors like red and black are common color schemes in this aesthetic. Visuals can sometimes resemble DarkErrorcore or Devilcore - but it depends on the image and form of aggression being represented. Visuals can include, but are not limited to: Various forms of hate have been embraced by practically all human societies, with certain types of hate being socially accepted and even encouraged, while others are deemed incredibly taboo. Various human cultures throughout history have embraced tribalism to some extent, and at times encouraged hatred of outsiders or those of a different race. Many religious groups have also embraced hatred to some extent, deeming unbelievers to be demonic and deserving of death and hellfire. Powerful institutions have also been known to harbor a culture of hatred within their companies and government institutions, discriminating against individuals based on race, gender, or sexuality. In many modern societies, hatred is accepted when it comes to criminals or the homeless, or when it comes to those who harm children or animals. Among some vegetarians and animal rights activists, a level of hatred is embraced against those who eat meat or contribute to factory farming. Political tensions and disagreements can also lead to outbreaks of violence and division in a community, effectively reducing the rise of multiculturalism. Violencecore fashion draws a lot of inspiration from a mix of both Punk and Bastardcore fashion, designed solely to provoke anger, hatred, and potential violence from people around them by being as offensive as possible. Violencecore fashion may also make heavy use of the gothic-rooted motif of using fake blood as an accessory of sorts. Violencecore music is violent, either in lyrics or in the melody/genre itself. Typical violencecore genres include Rock, Metal, and Alternative - but other genres may also be included. Keep in mind that many violencecore songs discuss upsetting topics, such as abuse or self-harm, and that listeners should listen with discretion if they are sensitive to these topics. Bloodcore is a sub-aesthetic of violencecore concentrating on pictures of bloody faces, teeth, and hands - usually centered around very strong feelings such as anger that provoked such violence from someone. It can be paralleled with Yandere, Devilcore, Goth, and even Pastel Goth aesthetics for content such as moodboards and playlists.

These places are usually cluttered with human activity (like cars or tourists) and are filled with massive amounts of advertisements and chaotic mixes of neon lights and colors. This type of places are often criticized for their unabashed mass-consumerism, but some people also find it visually appealing and even an iconic aspect of these urban areas. This locations have inspired various modern aesthetics like Cyberpunk and Synthwave because of their maximalistic use of neon lights and futuristic ambients. The first place to contain Visual Pollution is thought to be the Times Square in New York City. At the time the place was known as Long Acre, and it was a relatively chill neighborhood. However, during the late 1880s, it underwent various transformations to make it more safe and futuristic. New elements were introduced to the Times Square, like electricity, in the form of theater advertisements and street lights[1]. Although it's not like it is today, this means that the typical Visual Pollution style in various cities dates back to over 140 years ago. This style kept evolving in its appareance. In 1942, after the Great Depression and during World War II, the mayor of New York City (Fiorello La Guardia) made some reforms in the Time Square, including adding more illuminated advertisements and lights in the interior and exterior of the neighborhood. Visual Pollution is also seen in Japan. Around the start of the 20th century, colorful advertising banners were used to grab attention of visitors of the entertainment districts. As the country began to experience rapid economic growth after World War II, Japanese businesses started using neon lights to create eye-catching and attention-grabbing signs, and they started using bright colors and bold designs. One of the first areas in Japan to be heavily influenced by this aesthetic was Akihabara, a district in Tokyo that is known for its electronics stores and Otaku culture. This style still holds significant popularity in the major cities of other east Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Thailand, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The aesthetic Visual Pollution had also propagated to early websites in the 2000s in a electronic form of Dollar Store Vernacular. They were filled with long lists of links, large paragraphs of text, buttons, images, logos, and promotions.  While this style faded out on Western websites in favor of Minimalism (the opposite of Visual Pollution), it continued to be the predominate style in Asian websites. Some visuals prominent in Visual Pollution include: This type of places in major cities are often criticized because they promote a culture of mass consumerism and are generally extremely harmful to the enviroment, as well as the people who live in these areas. Neon lights create a significant amount of light pollution on the areas, and they can interfere with some people's daily lives: it can make it difficult to sleep around the area, attract massive amounts of tourists that outgrow the locals and affect people with sensory processing disorders negatively. These exaggerated amount of neon lights also require a lot of electricity to function properly, causing worrying damage to the local landscape as well as climate change. In recent years, some cities have taken steps to reduce this phenonenom. For example, in Hong Kong, neon lights are starting to be taken down because its autonomous government has introduced new regulations to promote environmentalism in the city[2].",

It is popular among Gen Z and older gen alpha girls on TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest and Roblox and could be described as trendy, cheerful and luxurious. It is commonly confused with Softies or Preppy itself, a college subculture from the northeastern United States. The VSCO Preppy visual aesthetic is influenced by the VSCO and Preppy aesthetics, hence the Preppy part of their name. VSCO Preppies tend to associate The Evil Eye with their outfits as well; but some don’t know the meaning behind it. Common motifs and patterns include but are not limited to: Social media-worthy pictures are edited using the Coogee Filter (from the app Colortone), presets from Adobe Lightroom or the app called \"VSCO\". On TikTok, they usually use the \"Brew\" or \"California\" filter. Popular clothing pieces from brands like Aviator Nation, LoveShackFancy, and Roller Rabbit can be inaccessible to the average teenage girl due to their high price, so knockoffs and dupes from stores (often of the fast fashion variety) like SHEIN are popular. Hundreds of shops catering to the VSCO Preppy aesthetic popped up on Etsy during the pandemic, but many items which sellers claim to make themselves are actually purchased cheaply from Aliexpress. Girls generally wear: DRESSES AND SKIRTS: Beachy/boho dresses/skirts with animal/floral print and/or frilly decorations like tassels, pompoms, and ruffles.

Lululemon belt bags are also extremely popular among preppies, typically in black or white and occasionally in hot pink.

There is no section for the male counterpart because they are not as popular and are rare to find, so not much is known about them. Food tends to be luxurious food that can be purchased in a restaurant. They sometimes eat fast foods and foods from local shops. These include, but are not limited to: Preppy girls love to listen to summer music and pop music. Some preppies are big Swifties and are against Kanye West.

They like to watch films and series like: Gossip Girl, Dance moms, Gilmore Girls, The Baby-Sitters Club, Pitch Perfect, Mamma Mia, Legally Blonde, Mean Girls and The Parent Trap.

Preppy VSCO's tend to play sports like: The animals used in this aesthetic are: And other animals with flashy colors and bold prints! They can be painted onto canvases as mentioned in the art section, typically in pink. VSCO Preppies act energetic and are usually very upbeat and laid-back.

Preps tend to say the following: \"Bestie!\" \"Love ya!\" \"XOXO <3\" \"Fun!\" \"Vogue\" \"Wild one!\" \"You are golden!\" \"An iced coffee a day keeps the bad vibes away!\" \"Ding-dong, your opinion is wrong!\" \"Self-love\" \"The way you speak to yourself matters.\" \"Did I imagine it?\" \"I hadn't thought of it like that...\" \"Girlypop” \"Cool!\" \"Slayy!\" Sometimes, this aesthetic gets hate for their toxic behaviour and their resemblance to That Girl.  This also gets a lot of hate for being stereotyped as rich white girls who are spoiled, have an apartment or mansion near or not in coastal areas for VSCO Preppy beach views and having tons of skincare products from brands such as CeraVe or TreeHut.

It's very common with Therians and alterhumans as a whole. It takes its name from the practice of working with animals that have died of natural causes, as opposed to hunting or trapping. Specimens are commonly acquired from roadkill or found in woodland areas. Practitioners, (called \"vultures\"), may choose to preserve an entire animal, body parts, pelts, or bones. Several methods are used to enhance the appearance of pieces; including dying, crystallization, and diaphonization; making jewelry from smaller bones or paws is also popular. In addition to taxidermy, vultures create art featuring skulls and themes of decay. The online community largely consists of the sharing and selling of work, and exchanging advice and stories. Some vultures incorporate the hobby into their spiritual or occult practices. As Vulture Culture is heavily biased in preserving animal remains, it is a staple activity of the aesthetic. This can be done in a multitude of ways. For bones, dying or painting, using borax to crystalize them, or utilizing them in jewelry are common practices. For whole animal remains, taxidermy or preserving them using the diaphanization process are usually preferred. Vulture Culture practitioners often bond over this craft. This can be helping others preserve and display, purchasing work from another vulture, or simply bonding over their shared interests in the aesthetic.",

However, as the education movement has grown, it has also established itself as its own aesthetic. The Aesthetic is very much related to Cottagecore but without the French Impressionist inspirations. Unlike the educational style, the aesthetic of Waldorf is for all ages and nearly universal. Waldorf is the secular term for the aesthetic, however many schools and people who follow Waldorf methods follow Wicca, hence the secondary name, Light Wicca. Waldorf is very similar to a more colorful, and childish Wicca aesthetic and is the primary decorative style of choice for many Wiccans/Witches, especially those with children. Waldorf as a style is a minimalist movement in the style of forestcore, fairycore, or cottagecore. But a lot of the visuals can differ strongly, although some similarities overlap. Waldorf, being based off an educational system takes on a very youthful look in fashion aspects, so keep that in mind. Clothing is not usually vintage, it can be but it's not common. Think more along the lines of hippie or bohemian. Waldorf education, also known as Steiner education, is based on the educational philosophy of Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Anthroposophy. Its pedagogy strives to develop pupils' intellectual, artistic, and practical skills in an integrated and holistic manner. The cultivation of pupils' imagination and creativity is a central focus. Individual teachers and schools have a great deal of autonomy in determining curriculum content, teaching methodology, and governance. Qualitative assessments of student work are integrated into the daily life of the classroom, with quantitative testing playing a minimal role and standardized testing usually limited to what is required to enter post-secondary education. Many Waldorf aesthetic activities revolve around the original curriculum of the teaching style. Because it's based in creativity, a lot of activities are art or nature based.",

Wanderlust may reflect an intense urge for self-development by experiencing the unknown, confronting unforeseen challenges, getting to know unfamiliar cultures, ways of life and behaviors or may be driven by the desire to escape and leave behind depressive feelings of guilt, and has been linked to bipolar disorder in the periodicity of the attacks. In adolescence, dissatisfaction with the restrictions of home and locality may also fuel the desire to travel.

Webcore draws inspiration from the Memphis Lite, Y2K Futurism, and Frutiger Aero eras, partially overlapping with Vaporwave. Subgenres of Webcore include 2010s Internet, Digital Oddity, and Old Meme. Webcore utilizes retro web/tech design elements (i.e. screencaps, GIFs, clip-art, video games) combined with aspects of poetry and self-expression. Webcore's philosophical heart yearns for the days of uninhibited individualism of the old Web, before the internet became streamlined and social media monopolized how people communicated, and web graphic design developed a stricter set of rules for the \"dos\" and \"don'ts\" for the sake of accessibility and marketing. Many Webcore screencaps and GIFs come from archived GeoCities websites made by amateur coders and animators. The limited nature of the internet contributed to old Web graphics being a bit rough around the edges. Harsh website design choices, clunky animations, and pixel art are all defining traits of the Webcore aesthetic. Another main visual aesthetic that this category follows is the rounded blue edge windows that old software on Windows XP achieved, the sharp looking windows that appeared on software from Windows 95/98, or the glassy backgrounds that Windows Vista is much known for (in terms of looks). This may also include early 3D examples from Windows' screensavers or commercial, ads for any of Microsoft's product or even software that characterized the old Windows operating systems. With the popularity of the webcore series ENA by Peruvian animator Joel G., webcore/internetcore could also apply to digital, polygon-like surrealism and worlds, thanks to the series. Webcore, musically, relates itself audibly to Vaporwave, since usually the people who follow this aesthetic are in major part responsible for the Vaporwave movement. There's a genre that people who follow this aesthetic have created: Mockup bootup/shutdown screens. Webcore music can also be music that first gained popularity in the golden days of YouTube. Perhaps the kickstarter to most of music associated with Webcore online came in the form of the online animated digital-surrealism series ENA by Peruvian animator Joel G., whose music featured in the series is a mix of instrumental electronic, IDM, and techno-like sounds, with many banding songs similar to the sound, whether it be other ambient or IDM or general instrumental artists or even video game soundtracks that are instrumental akin to those in internetcore. However, a common and almost mislabeling part of the music is the usage of other songs that should not be considered webcore in it of itself. Music heard and used and made for series or games considered Webcore are instrumental pieces with regular rhythms, percussions (drums) and additional synths and bass (e.g. Graham Kartna and Oliver Buckland, two of the more popular webcore artists), ambient-like sounds (e.g. Mort Garson, Lee Rosevere, Fennesz), techno-like (e.g. METAROOM, Yesterdayneverhappened, or Nanoray), IDM-like or even Footwork/Juke-like sounds alongisde Drum and Bass and Jungle (should they be instrumental, e.g. DJ Orange Julius, Pizza Hotline, Sawteeth), but other \"non-webcore\" songs are usually those heard in most playlists on YouTube and Spotify contain songs that have lyrics in them, contradicting the music-like sound and element of the Webcore aesthetic, almost as if it defeats the purpose. Songs by artists such as JPEGMafia, Death Grips, Sewerslvt (partially), Drive45, 100 gecs, Kero Kero Bonito, Digigurl, or Temporex, and even the recently popular 1983 song \"Possibly in Michigan Cannibal Animal\" from the short film \"Possibly in Michigan\" directed by Cecelia Condit are usually heard in Weirdcore-like playlists and or are mislabeled by the general song when it comes to actual Webcore music (even the official webcore Spotify playlist has this issue), or are simply indie pop music of varying sounds that don't actually have anything in common with Webcore music. Webcore music can also include video game soundtrack songs, such as those from Chrono Trigger (1995), Ico (2001), Minecraft (2009), Hylics 2 (2020) and Robot 64 from Roblox (2017) amongst others, and newer video game soundtracks, such as the Hypnospace Outlaw soundtrack composed by Jay Tholen (2019, most notably Volume 2 of the soundtrack, and excluding songs with vocals featured), and also the SCP songs by Belgian musician Glenn Leroi, based on the game SCP: Containment Breach, the video game adaptation of the collaborative horror series The SCP Foundation, particularly the instrumentals of the SCP songs. The soundtracks of the famous webcomic Homestuck by Andrew Hussie, who Toby Fox and other musicians have composed on, have the soundtrack labelled as webcore. IDM artists like Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Autechre and Casino Versus Japan have songs that have a webcore-like sound to them. Several \"classic\" songs, most notably classic ambient, early electronica, and even new age music could even be considered Webcore music, with albums like Plantasia by Mort Garson (1976), Keyboard Fantasies by Beverly-Glenn Copeland (1986, excluding the songs with vocals featured), L'Univers De La Mer by Dominique Guiot (1978) and New Age of Earth by Ashra (1979), and even including early synth-pop pioneers such as Yellow Magic Orchestra (whose song \"Simoon\" was covered in the credits of Temptation Stairway from ENA) and Kraftwerk. Other modern ambient and general instrumental electronic musicians like Carbon Based Lifeforms and Four Tet also have webcore-like sounds. Another note is that there are some musicians who have specific songs whom stand out from the rest of their discography, notably jazz for example, with songs like \"Textures\" by Herbie Hancock, and both \"Don't Let the World Pass You By\" and \"Computer Incantations for World Peace\" by Jean-Luc Ponty. Some vaporwave songs could be considered Webcore in a way, such as songs from One Hundred Mornings by Windows 96 (2018) or even select songs by English-American collaborative duo 2814 and musician and producer Haircuts for Men. There are several artists who have instrumental pieces of their lyrical songs online but not available on official music apps like Spotify. An example can be the famous online rapper Viper, whose instrumentals of songs like \"They Wanna See Me Dead 'Cause of My Hops\" or \"Stuck on Grind to Shine\" are available online, but not on official music apps, but the instrumental themselves, while being in an obvious DYI hip-hop sound, have various amateur static sounds in them, making them webcore in the process. However, do note that some artists whose songs are webcore in sound can also be fitting in weirdcore amongst other aesthetics, whoever they should be instrumental if possible. The best examples of playlists online are those of YouTuber Chickpea, and their four main Internetcore playlists based around the ENAWave side of Internetcore, with all songs being true to the sound of internetcore, with no pop sounds, no vocals, no VOCALOID songs, and no Weirdcore-like sound. The following lists are examples of webcore musicians and artists (including those whose music sounds similar but not all) alongside others in their genre-sounds alongside old and new musicians or bands. Video game, movies and webcomic soundtracks and their composers (select songs should be instrumental): For a better example per song, the Spotify playlist Internetscapes by Big Gorilla Bird has the most usage of songs and genre, the important factor. Around 300 + songs, it does not include any form of weirdcore or any other genre that is mislabeled in the playlist. The first 30 songs are an example of what SHOULD be in a webcore/internetcore playlist, for an idea as to what the genre/aesthetic should sound like. Some potential activities and hobbies of the Webcore aesthetics include going to old webpages and using old avatar chat programs (like the infamous Worlds.com; an old chatting program that is largely abandoned these days save for a dedicated group of people who act like a Satanic cult to mess with newcomers who come in). This page details a list of old platform “revivals” you can restore functionality with. For those REALLY adventurous individuals in Webcore, there's always traveling the Dark Web, but be careful where you go on the Dark Web lest you stumble upon some potentially illegal content (though, to dispel the myths, no, not every website on the deep web is a hub for illegal pornography, hiring hitmen, and buying drugs, there are plenty of innocent sites on the Deep Web). Even with this note aside, please take caution while exploring the Dark Web. Do not click any suspicious links and use an antivirus software. Another popular activity within the Webcore aesthetic is playing games that were popular at the time the Old Web aesthetics were prominence (such as The Sims™). It is also somewhat popular to browse archives of Flash games and animations, such as the one hosted on the Internet Archive (in-browser), or Bluemaxima's Flashpoint (application; requires download). Many action cartoons in the 2000s were enamored by technology, and some had a focus on the internet or had fictional depictions of a cyberspace dimension. Some Western action cartoons made after that period, such as Steven Universe and Young Justice, also took inspiration from this era for their worldbuilding, even if the internet was not a major theme in them. Chinese science fiction and science fantasy media tends to take inspiration from older science fiction from the region. Xianxia and cultivation novels became popular on the internet in the 2000s in China. There was a spirit of optimism in that period about social networking and China's enormous technological growth,[1] and its influence can be found in future Chinese science fantasy, such as Dragon Talisman, which integrates Japanese isekai tropes about leveling systems and has characters that use systems to create multiversal social networks.

Visually, it is strongly influenced by the general look and feel of images shared on an older internet, roughly a period spanning from around the late 90's to mid 2000's. Amateur editing, primitive digital graphics, lo-fi photography and image compression are some of the most common elements found in Weirdcore images. Thematically, Weirdcore often conveys a feeling of dread, brought forth by its low-quality imagery and a lack of context in regard to the location or the message being shown. This does not mean that Weirdcore is deeply rooted in horror, however, as the feeling of fear left on the viewer is merely a side effect of placing them in an unfamiliar setting or context. This is purely subjective however, and depends on the viewer, their own experiences and the content of an edit; while some people might find a Weirdcore image scary or ominous, others might feel nostalgia or even a feeling of comfort. Amateur, blurry or Lo-Fi photography is one of the most common elements in Weirdcore. These are often Liminal Spaces, an aesthetic that Weirdcore has a strong connection to and often relies on, but the use of them is not obligatory. The virtual part of an image often (but not always) manifests itself in the form of plain-looking text which conveys a message that is incomplete or out of context, thus leaving the viewer to ask questions and make their own interpretations in regard to the meaning of the statement presented to them (keep in mind that text is not a necessary part of Weirdcore). It is important to know, however, that both of these \"portions\" of Weirdcore do not need to be present simultaneously to make a good image; for example, a Weirdcore image may be constructed exclusively out of virtual elements and could still be categorized as such. The same applies to amateur/lo-fi photography, but regardless of how the process of creating Weirdcore is approached, the images should still aim to put the viewer in an unfamiliar, confusing, and occasionally somewhat hostile context. Currently, the exact origins of Weirdcore are unknown, but they may go as far back as the early 2010s. It has recently been determined that the earliest Weirdcore edit with a confirmed date of creation was made in 2016, but there could be earlier examples out there that remain unknown. The genre started to pick up popularity when a YouTuber by the name of DavidCrypt uploaded a video explaining the Weirdcore aesthetic. Whilst there are popular Weirdcore creators, it is often hard to find the most popular or the origins of the content and creators, as most current Weirdcore content is uploaded to Tumblr, which doesn't show follower counts, as well as numerous reposts. There are many places online to get in touch with the Weirdcore community: (NOTE: Credits being added)",

The Western aesthetic entails themes of self-reliance, solitude, and wildness. Western folklore often includes tales of lone vigilantes travelling the American Frontier on horseback, more times than not armed with a six-shooter revolver or a rifle and prepared to dole out justice. Visually, the Western aesthetic shares many similarities to that of Country, but places an emphasis on imagery of the historical Wild West, as well as the motifs of vigilantism and adventure commonly depicted in popular Western films. While the Country aesthetic romanticizes the life of family, farming, and living in the countryside, Western focuses more on the idea of the wilderness, specifically the desert and prairie, as well as wandering town to lawless town dotted across the American Frontier. The Western look emerged at the time of American expansion westward from the settlers who founded the first townships. Old West attire was commonly handmade and included warm earth tones and organic materials. The outfits and style of American cowboys were inspired by Mexican Vaqueros who taught the cowboys many of their techniques for cow herding. Wide-brimmed hats to protect from the scorching desert sun and spurs crucial for horse riding were essential for all travelling frontiersmen and women. Sunsets and tumbleweeds are iconic symbols of the Western setting. The Western aesthetic includes barren or semi-arid deserts, prairies, and mountains that are scattered across the American Frontier. The outposts and small towns that inhabited the West were marked by wooden buildings, saloons, churches, and other small developments. Crime was extremely rife in the Old West and is a major theme of the Western aesthetic. Rogue gangs of armed outlaws ran wild in the Old West, such as Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch or the Cochise County Cowboys, who may have been responsible for connecting the term \"Cowboy\" to mean \"Outlaw.\" The notoriety and shenanigans of popular Wild West gangs inspired much of Western media that followed after the fall of the American Frontier. Common Visuals: Western fashion typically includes organic fabrics and warm tones. Fashion often revolved around utility and practicality for outdoor work. Leather, cowboy boots, and wide-brimmed hats mark some of the key characteristics of Western fashion. Brimmed hats were a cowboy's most important piece of clothing, as they helped keep the elements out of their eyes and face when riding or doing any other work. Cowboys often took extra care into upkeeping the quality of their hats, often owning hat brushes or taking them into town to get them reshaped or repaired. Good quality hats were often a family heirloom that could be passed down for many decades. Modern rodeo fashion often includes bright colors, elaborate embroidery, and the usage of decorative rhinestones in order to distinguish different riders. Much like its namesake, the well-worn trends, traditions, and motifs of Western have been explored in great detail in a variety of mediums, most notably the Western film genre. The Hollywood Western was first popularized in the early 20th century by John Ford's 1939 film Stagecoach. John Wayne, the main actor of Stagecoach, later went on to become one of the most notable Hollywood Western film actors. The Spaghetti Western is a subgenre of the traditional Western film produced in Europe. The subgenre emerged in mid-1960s among Italian director Sergio Leone's box-office successes that caught the attention of viewers around the globe. Clint Eastwood is one of the best known actors in the Spaghetti Western film genre. Eastwood is best known for his role as \"The Man with No Name\" in the Dollars Trilogy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_frontier\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cowboys_and_cowgirls",

Mud, moss, fungi, erosion and rust are often related to wet environments, and humans usually avoid to live in places with such things, such are swamps[1]. Still, the aesthetic requires humans or human-made objects in such conditions. Wetcore is often, but not limited, to feelings of sadness, decadence and even despair. However, it can also offer positive feelings of connection with nature. On TikTok, there is currently a viral trend where normal human-made places are getting flooded, and this trend is called \"Poseidon's Curse\"; however, in this variant, it doesn't attribute to any specific feelings or mood. Wetcore focus on human made or inhabited places and objects that are constantly wet, yet in normal circumstances would be expected to be dry. Styles such as Ocean Academia, Gloomcore or Junglecore are almost always related to wetness and water, but Wetcore is by itself the integration between human lifestyle and wetness as if it was an unavoidable everyday reality. The colors grey, brown, and green are commonly present in this aesthetic. However, other colors can be found such as blue and black. Colors in this aesthetic are usually cold colors, which reflects the feelings the aesthetic aims to convey. However, warm colors such as brown or orange, like rust, can also be considered wetcore. There are many different shades of these colors that can be found in this aesthetic. For example brown: in Wetcore, brown can have an orange shade, much like rust, but it can also be darker, like mud. It does not really matter where the water for the wetness come from. It may be constant rain, wet climate or a nearby water source. The archetypical city of Wetcore is, of course, Venice, Italy. Common modern manifestations of Wetcore are, for example, the infamous mud roads of Russia. There are some exceptions, for example, jungle structure made by natives, as the jungle may not always be cool or cold. Another exception is how most Wetcore environments are often based on freshwater sources, but Venice's water is saltwater. A city during a rainstorm and the wet city just after the rain has stopped can also count as Wetcore, even though the city would usually be dry. Plants in the Wetcore aesthetic are found in swamps, flooded, wet and damp areas. Many different plants such as ferns and moss, as well as fungi are associated with the Wetcore aesthetic, especially moss and fungi as they can grow on wet walls. They give off a specific musty smell. Aquatic plants such as water lilies, are found in ponds, making them appropriate to be considered Wetcore.",

During this time of the year, people tend to stay more at their homes to not be exposed to the low temperatures, making the season be associated with more calm, cozy elements. Some examples are staying at home near a fireplace, wrapped around a blanket, watching a movie, and reading books. It is also closely tied to the holiday of Christmas, which in itself has values of unity and kindness. Foods are served while hot, such as hot cocoa, tea, lace and gingerbread cookies, fruitcakes, soup, and ham.

Witch House songs usually present an aesthetic that incorporates themes that are dark and revolve around the occult, the supernatural, and horror. While Witch House definitely revolves more around music, it has been visually interpreted, taking a lot of cues from the Vaporwave school of aesthetic thought. It has been interpreted in three ways, which have sometimes been known to merge: While there is a lot of crossover with the Witchcore aesthetic, make no mistake: Witchcore takes more of a nature-based approached compared to the more dark tech-y Witch House aesthetic, which can also invoke Satanic imagery on top of everything. Witch House fashion can draw upon a lot of Nu-Goth, Streetwear, Techwear, and Vaporwave fashions (although in the case of Vaporwave inspirations, it's done less in the bright colors often associated with it and instead uses more of a monochromatic color palette with hints of red mixed in). Witch House fashion can also draw upon a lot of 90s Grunge and Mallgoth fashion choices as well. Musically, Witch House has a droning, dark, and gothic sound to it that's designed to evoke a gothic atmosphere that works surprisingly well with the House music format. Also, the genre is characterized by the use of high-pitched keyboard effects, heavily layered basslines and trap-style drum loops. Influences include goth ethereal wave, shoegaze, noise, early industrial bands as well as DJ Screw via the chopped and screwed technique.  Many Witch House artists have released slowed down and backmasked remixes of pop and hip hop songs with a dark distorted sound, calling it \"drag\" or \"zombie rave\" mixes.

It often involves magic, herbs, and gem collecting. It has some elements of Cottagecore or Naturecore since some of the aesthetic revolves around the outdoor setting. Witchcore visuals vary by type of witchcraft; however, there are patterns of objects and places frequently involved in witchcraft and witchcore as an aesthetic. Here is a general list of such items: Witchy fashion is pretty noticeable upon seeing it, though there is not one uniform witches must follow. Witchy fashion utilizes a variety of darker hued, natural colors and black. Vintage wear from thrift stores or hand-me-downs are often seen in this aesthetic, as well as some gothic/goth/nu-goth themes and hippie/boho themes. When in doubt, google Stevie Nicks. Keep in mind that searching for witchy clothing on Google is not reflective of the true aesthetic, search tags on social media for more relevant examples or see the Pinterest boards and photos on this page. Examples of witchy fashion are below: Decor for witches is typically very natural and have some kind of use. Decor is usually foraged, thrifted, or made, but there are certain items that are strongly suggested be bought from small metaphysical shops. Some things like crystals, flowers, and incense can have a purpose for the craft while others can be for the aesthetic and for happiness. Key items include: Teen Witch was an aesthetic pioneered in the early 2010s and popularized by the online magazine, Rookie. The aesthetic revolved around a mixture of alternative media popular with teenage girls and the iconography of Catholics and Pagans. This includes shrines, crosses, inverted crosses, Ouija boards, and white dresses. The imagery referenced in this aesthetic often sat closely with the interests of Tavi Gevinson (teenage editor of Rookie Magazine) and Petra Collins, a photographer who produced many editorials for the publication.

It's similar to Witchcore, with the same theme of magic, just more central. Along with the need of knowledge and experimentation, whether it be of interests or projects. Wizardcore has its roots in folklore and mythology surrounding magicians in various cultures in the world. For example, the mythical magician Merlin was depicted in the legend of King Arthur. In the 20th century, wizards began to be associated with the fantasy genre of fiction. Wizards were often seen as the antagonists in a genre of Pulp Magazines called Swords and Sorcery. This continued into the boom of fantasy fiction from the 1960s to the 1980s, largely based on the popularization of The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. These depictions of wizards often featured them with large cloaks and pointed hats surrounded by magic and energy, which is the Wizardposting aesthetic. In the 1990s, the depictions of wizards started to change to be toned down and less archetypical. For example, the Harry Potter series depicted wizards as ordinary people. Modern Wizardcore is mostly based on this variation of the aesthetic. Visuals that are apart of Wizardcore but not limited to: Fictional wizards, people who use or practice magic derived from supernatural, occult, or arcane sources.

However, it shouldn't be confused with Wizardcore and Witchcore, as it rejects the muted imagery and Cottagecore stylings associated with those aesthetics. The imagery is bright and fantastical; the cabalistic gibbering of a withered greybeard, palms erupting with primordial, elemental force -- oh! A warlock, pointed hat raised high to the heavens, siphoning the raw energy of the ley line for a ritual. At the start of 2021, Wizardcore became popular with anti-feminists because Witchcore was popular with feminists and wizards are seen as the counterpart of witches. It was also because wizards are seen as the Sigma archetype due to living a solitary lifestyle and being very powerful. This type of wizardcore declined around the end of 2021. Around 2023, edits of art from 1980s wizard artwork with humorous captions went viral on tiktok and instagram, similar to the \"pondering my orb\" meme from 2021. These edits are known \"Wizardposting\"; they are typically either about relating being a wizard to a real life situation or just the humor of being a wizard in a fantasy setting. This trend also spread to Dwarfs with \"Dwarfposting\". The visuals are primarily rooted in epic fantasy art from the latter half of the twentieth century. It is often cluttered, brightly colored, and highly kinetic, and may take inspiration from psychedelic art. The art includes elemental magic, such as the conjuration of fire or lightning. Astronomical imagery, such as stars, planets, and nebulae, may be associated with magewave. Elements of classic tabletop fantasy and dungeon crawling may also be present. Though pointy hats, bushy eyebrows, and flowing white beards are not strictly necessary, they are a hallmark of the aesthetic. Other examples of magewave visuals include: Magewave music tends to be up-tempo, conveying a certain sense of power, much like the frenetic, diabolic magical eruptions of a gnarled swamp-crone. Power and symphonic metal are often well-suited to the Magewave aesthetic. However, the life of a wizard is not all fireballs and disintegration rays. The ponderous drone of dungeon synth is also an excellent reflection of the more mundane aspects of Magewave.",

They can represent a world family or a concept, or visually represent the words of a source text and its main ideas. The bigger a word is on a word cloud, the more importance it has to the source text or idea. Similiarly to ASCII art, word clouds can be used for a wide variety of things: they are often used on advertisements to represent the purposes and values of a company/website or to represent a concept, and other uses include art made out of words, cartography, maps, linguistics, representing the key ideas of a topic, studying, among many other uses. The origin of World clouds can be traced back to the Milgran social experiments carried out by the psychologist Stanley Milgram in the 1960s[1]. In 1976, in one of the experiments, they made over 200 participants from Paris draw a map of said city, mentioning various local places or landmarks. Milgram & Jodelet wrote down the number of mentions of each Parisian landmark and compiled them into a map of Paris where each mentioned landmark appeared, but the most mentioned landmarks were represented as bigger words. World clouds became avaiable to a wider public online in the late 1990s and early 2000s and they were popularized among bloggers by the Flickr photo-sharing website. The popularity of World Clouds blew up in 2005 when the scientifist Jonathan Feinberg created an algorithm that could generate word clouds out of tags. In 2008, the algorithm became publicly avaiable and Feinberg invented the Wordle.net, which could generate word clouds out of any word for its users. The visuals of the World Clouds are really simple. Their most common characteristics are: External links can help you get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

This aesthetic is theorized to have started from the Furby fandom on Tumblr, as members of the Furby fandom often joked about Squirmles being a Furby's food. The phrase \"Oh, worm?\" became a Tumblr meme in early 2017, thus bringing the first wave of site-wide attention to the worm toys. Additionally, a Discord server called \"woerms\" was created in 2021 and treated these toys as if they were living creatures. Wormcore emerged as its own subculture in mid-to-late 2019. Wormcore memes often feature Worm-on-a-String toys making threats of violence, crime (especially arson), and the thievery of various body parts. Additionally, many include worm related puns such as asking \"any last worms?\" to a worm held at toy gun point. The Wormcore aesthetic features self expression and humor. Some key motifs include: Obviously dressing as a worm on a string isn't going to be possible as always, but a wormcore outfit can incorporate any of the following: Wormcore is not a music based subculture, but there are still songs about worms and playlists dedicated to them, as listed below.

It is not meant to romanticize these topics, but to show the effects it can have on a person's sanity and morals. The most recurring visuals are balloons, drugs, liminal spaces, and depressed women. Usually accompanied by messy amateurish dark black and white edits and the Helvetica Bold font. It heavily relies on taking things normally associated with fun and twisting them into something darker. This dark and lowkey aesthetic is what The Weeknd's early music heavily relied on, imagery wise. However the musical content is the main focus, which talked about elements of depression and manipulation. The main character appears extremely detached from the world around them, not caring about how their actions affect them and others surrounding them.

The tag of #xpiritualism was coined by 3rd.world.elite on Instagram. On TikTok edits often share the same commonly seen repeating elements, however on other nicher spaces on Instagram, Discord & YouTube, more innovation, combining and unique art styles are highly encouraged. This movement as a whole is defined by 3 main concepts of spirituality, old net art and world culture, so it isn't a solid defined style which is why it garners much appeal from its outsider art fanbase. It has a similar visual and editing style to Weirdcore, with surreal imagery and kitschy editing due to them coming from the same roots of early net art, but with mixing different artstyles with themes of spirituality, early net, ancient art and generally multiculturalism, as opposed to Weirdcore's simplicity and homogeneity. It's fanbase also often overlaps with neo-tribal and sextrance. Some common misconceptions have arisen about Xpiritualism, including: Xpiritualism is not an aesthetic nor style, it's a loose net art movement/a group of personal aesthetics, a community of people who support each other, collaborate, and make edits with similar motifs. Though it shares editing techniques with Weirdcore and Old Web, it isn't a maximalist version of either. It's also common for Xpiritualism to get called \"Yabujincore\" or \"CurseWeb\" in social media, but these names are very frowned upon by the actual fanbase because both Yabujin and CurseWeb are musical artists. Some of the fans also don't want this art movement to have a name altogether, arguing it potentially takes away what makes it special. However, \"Xpiritualism\" is the most commonly used name, particularly in Instagram. Contrary to popular assumption, this style wasn't created by Yabujin. Various net artists have been making edits like his for a long time now, with similar elements and a similar editing style, and some examples of this would be horribleluxury, Elysia Crampton, Thaiboy Digital, Do Thi Thien Ly Live Beautifully and FlorecitaDreams. Both Taconiel and CurseWeb were inspired by Yabujin, but built their own style afterwards, styles that could be considered individual aesthetics themselves due to people constantly recreating them. This movement seeks to create more styles, not repeat existing ones all while having recurring motifs of esotericism, multiculturalism and internet culture.",

After Y2K Futurism ended, it was succeeded by Frutiger Aero. Named after the Year 2000 problem, Y2K Futurism is characterized by slick futuristic fashion, technology, and music, signaling the optimism[1] for the 3rd Millennium or 21st Century. Some of its aspects include tight leather pants, shiny clothing, silver eye shadow, spiky up-dos, Oakleys, gradients, translucence, and Blobitecture. Y2K is mostly classified as a subcategory to Retro-Futurism, but some elements also cross over with Vaporwave, since it shares Vaporwave's angst towards late-stage (corpo-)capitalism, and its nostalgia for \"a future that never came\".[1] The term \"Y2K Aesthetic\", coined by Evan Collins of the Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute in 2016, originally referred specifically to Y2K Futurism. However, usage of \"Y2K\" later became more broad on social media, and this aesthetic now falls under the broader Y2K umbrella term. Y2K Futurism has its origins in the underground UK rave scene of the Late-1980s/Early-1990s. Rave flyers at this time featured designs that would later become known as the Y2K style, and artists released albums which would form the basis of Y2K-era electronica, i.e. The Prodigy's Experience (1992), Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works (recorded 1985–1992), and The Future Sound of London's Accelerator (1992). This period also saw the early works of the Sheffield-based Designers Republic, founded in 1986. The game Ridge Racer was released in 1993, an early example of Y2K aesthetics and music. Signs of the Futuristic Y2K aesthetic first going mainstream appeared around 1994 to 1996. The Corporate Gen-X Cyber style began appearing in ads, and CGI began rising following the success of Toy Story. Windows 95 was released, and started the Internet boom with the release of Internet Explorer. Gaming began transitioning to the fifth generation (Sega Saturn, original PlayStation, and Nintendo 64) with Y2K games such as Wipeout and Super Mario 64, but fourth-generation titles like SNES's Donkey Kong Country 1–3 remained prominent. The films Hackers, Trainspotting, and Scream were released as early examples of Y2K, as well as the music video for Michael and Janet Jackson's \"Scream\". Teen Pop artists like the Spice Girls, Robyn, and Backstreet Boys also made their debuts in Europe, but were not yet popular in America. Campaigns like Nintendo's \"Play It Loud\" era and style might have been a precursor to Y2K, as well. However, older aesthetics such as Alternative and Grunge still remained dominant during this time. Y2K became well-defined by 1997, replacing the mid-'90s era which had been known for its grittier aesthetics such as Grunge. The Spice Girls' single \"Wannabe\" was released in the U.S. and gained international popularity, leading to a new era in Teen Pop, and in a Super Bowl ad that year the group heralded the arrival of \"Generation Next\". Furthermore, Post-Grunge started to become popular with bands such as Creed and Foo Fighters, Nu-Metal began its mainstreaming with Limp Bizkit, Deftones, and Incubus, Hanson released \"Mmmbop\", and more music videos by artists such Puff Daddy (\"Mo Money Mo Problems\"), Will Smith (\"Gettin' Jiggy wit It\", \"Men in Black\"), and the Spice Girls (\"Say You'll Be There\") were done in the Y2K style. Electronica/big beat artists such as The Prodigy, Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky increased in mainstream visibility, as did rave culture. In an attempt to compete with rival companies such as WCW and ECW, WWF entered the edgier \"Attitude Era\" and had gotten rid of its Memphis Design styles (from the \"New Generation Era\") by March 1998. South Park and King of the Hill premiered, and Cartoon Network debuted the Toonami block which mainstreamed anime in the U.S. The PS1 and N64 were now in full swing with games such as Final Fantasy VII and Goldeneye. The movies Titanic and Men in Black were released which are regarded as Y2K phenomena. Y2K fashions such as frosted tips, soul patches, and JNCOs were becoming popular. Between 1998 and 2000, Y2K Futurism experienced a massive surge in popularity with phenomenon such as Nu-Metal (Korn, Limp Bizkit), Teen Pop (NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, TRL), The Matrix, and TOM replacing Moltar on Toonami. Apple's iMac G3 was released in 1998 which showcased Y2K designs. Pokémon was released in the U.S. in late 1998, leading to Pokémania. Sega's Dreamcast was an early example of sixth generation consoles. The 1999 music videos for TLC's \"No Scrubs\" and Jennifer Lopez's \"If You Had My Love\" also prominently featured Y2K Futurism. Y2K's popularity peaked around Late-1999/Early-2000, coinciding with the turn of the millennium and apex of the Dot-com Bubble.[2] The Y2K Era gradually declined afterward due to events such as the Dot-com Bubble Burst, 9/11, and the War on Terror, though residual aesthetics from the era still remained popular until roughly 2004. This overlap period is sometimes referred to as 2K1, a mixture of Y2K Futurism and the incoming McBling influences. 2004 was the last hurrah of the Y2K Era. Cartoon Network switched from the \"Powerhouse\" era to \"CN City\" era, with most of their '90s programs ending and Toonami moving to Saturday nights. Nickelodeon went through a similar transition also, with '90s Nicktoons, the SNICK block, and pre-movie SpongeBob SquarePants ending. The final major Nu-Metal albums were released in 2004, and emo soon overtook nu-metal as the dominant \"alternative\" music genre via the popularization of MySpace and artists such as My Chemical Romance. McDonald's retired the McDonaldLand characters (except for Ronald McDonald) and rebranded from the \"We love to see you smile\" slogan to the infamous \"I'm lovin' it\" slogan. The first Web 2.0 conference was held in October 2004, early social media sites such as MySpace were rising in popularity. Marvel's Blade series, known for its heavy use of Futuristic Y2K aesthetics and music, ended. The Rock retired from WWE, and Brock Lesnar temporarily left to join the NFL, leaving John Cena to become the face of the company. By 2005, the Futuristic Y2K aesthetic had more or less faded in the mainstream. After Y2K ended, it gave way to the Frutiger Aero aesthetic, which coincided with the advent of Web 2.0; Frutiger Aero is widely considered Y2K Futurism's successor aesthetic, containing various similarities but being distinct as an aesthetic in its own right. Since the Mid-Late 2010s, Y2K Era imagery and pop culture has begun to make a resurgence in various circles of the Internet, niche entertainment, and even mainstream entertainment due to the 20-year nostalgia cycle. Examples of Y2K revival songs include \"1999\" by Charli XCX, \"2002\" by Anne Marie, and \"Motivation\" by Normani. Evan Collins coined the term in 2016, having noticed the aesthetic had not yet been explored by the Vaporwave scene as much as earlier, more ubiquitous periods[3] (particularly '80s/Early '90s aesthetics like Memphis Design and Synthwave), and wanting to give it more exposure. Collins runs the Y2K Aesthetic Institute along with Froyo Tam. They archive works exhibiting the aesthetic, in the fields of graphic design, flyers, game console design, video game concept art, interior design, architecture, fashion, etc. and chronicle both art from the era the aesthetic was popular, as well as modern depictions of the aesthetic. Tam has also made Ferrite Core DX and other open-source typefaces inspired by Y2K typography. Another example of modern-Y2K aesthetics being used is the indie puzzle game known as CROSSNIQ+, which utilizes the more bold, thick-line aesthetics seen in Y2K cartoon styles. Also run by Krieger and The Y2K Institute is u::r::here, a free virtual gallery dedicated to showing off Y2K art and aesthetics. The most major community forum that is based on Y2K aesthetics is Agora Road's Macintosh Cafe, which coins itself as a \"nostalgic Y2K community\". There are some smaller ones, such as the Orion's Arm forum, although that one is primarily about the fictional universe itself.*The aesthetic seems to be breaking into pop culture, such as the Charli XCX and Troye Sivan song 1999. Y2K Futurism aesthetics use both graphic design and CGI. Graphic designs usually feature thick lines, bold minimalism, and heavy use of iconography. CGI art is more blobby looking, having more gradients in contrast to Metalheart or Chromecore. Common colors used in Y2K art are, but not limited to, chrome, icy blue, ocean, bright oranges, glossy white, and black (for linework). One of the earliest definers of the Futuristic Y2K aesthetic is the Designers Republic, a Sheffield-based graphic design studio best known for their work on the video game series Wipeout as well as various album artwork, especially for artists on the electronica label Warp Records. Founded by Ian Anderson and Nick Phillips in 1986, they were best known for making art that subverts brash consumerism and the uniformity of corporate culture. Like Vaporwave, much of their work also drew inspiration from Japanese anime, which was beginning to rise in popularity around the same time. Being that this was the era that the cell phone was first starting to become popular among your average consumer, you can find a lot of nods to the original models of cell phones (such as the original Nokia phones or the clamshell/flip phones) within the Y2K Futurism aesthetic. Also popular around this time was the Blobject, a type of design product (often a household object) distinguished by smooth flowing curves, bright translucent colors (part of the then-popular clear craze fad), and an absence of sharp edges. Products of the time include Apple's Bondi Blue iMac G3, and Nintedo's Atomic Purple Game Boy Color. The word is a portmanteau of \"blob\" and \"object\". Blobitecture, also known as 'blobism’, is a term given to a post-modern architectural style characterized by curved and rounded building shapes, or 'blob architecture'. Blobitecture buildings appear to have an organic form that is soft and free-flowing, yet comes together to produce a complex whole. Blobitecture buildings started popping up around the Late '90s/Early 2000s to reflect a lot of the trends at the time, giving the buildings something of a \"futuristic\" look at the time (by the standards of what constituted futuristic at that time period). Y2K Futurism is a very new concept, but with certain brands that were popular at the time still existing, one could easily predict these brands could potentially play a huge role in Y2K Futurism. Also, it should be noted a lot of Holosexual aesthetics and style can turn up in Futuristic Y2K fashion as well (due to its usage in futuristic fashion at the time). Low-rise skirts are usually really popular in this aesthetic. Japan's Fruits magazine, published from 1997 to 2017, has also been popular among Y2K fashion revivalists. Nu-metal and Industrial rock were closely associated with the Y2K period, particularly in the United States and France, and received particular attention after the Woodstock '99 festival. The subgenres epitomized the more masculine aesthetics of the Y2K period, combining Hip-Hop and Electronic styles with Heavy Metal. Artists such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Deftones, Filter, Incubus, Coal Chamber, American Head Charge, Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Tool, and Rob Zombie epitomized this controversial strain of Y2K culture. Subcultural styles like Mallgoth, Rivethead, and Cybergoth epitomized part of the Dark landscape style, a subtle offshoot of the landscape aesthetic heavily inspired by nu-metal and industrial culture in the landscape era. One of the most well-known music associated with Y2K in the United Kingdom was big beat, a subgenre of electronic music that used \"heavy breakbeats and synthesizer-generated loops and patterns\". Bands and music producers such as The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, Junkie XL, and Propellerheads performed this music during the '90s. However, the genre has since become less prevalent in the mainstream, with modern examples being few and far in between. Another known genre at the time was trance, which has become more modernized and mainstream. Famous DJs from this period like Push, Ferry Corsten, Tiësto, Chicane, PPK, ATB, Signum, and Lange demonstrated well the euphoric and futuristic vibe of the Y2K aesthetic. Other tracks that became hits during the turn of the Millennium were \"Better Off Alone\" by Alice Deejay, Darude's \"Sandstorm\", and Rank 1's \"Airwave\". Hands Up is a microgenre of music that originated in Germany, consisting of songs that could equally fall under genres like Trance, Electronic Dance Music and Eurodance all at once. With most artists in the genre hailing from Germany, some of the most popular ones include ItaloBrothers, Manian, Cascada, Basslovers United, Paffendorf and 666. Other well known Hands Up musicians are Basshunter, from Sweden, DJ Splash, from Hungary, or Clubraiders, from Austria. The genre stopped being mainstream by the early 2010s, although these songs continued to be featured in Nightcore remixes. Other genres used during the Y2K Era were jungle, drum n' bass, and trip-hop (like Portishead, Massive Attack or Tricky). Much like big beat (and what ultimately inspired big beat to begin with), these genres have a heavy emphasize on techno-style music, with fast beats and use of synthesizers. To this day, these genres are still used in EDM scenes all over. Bubblegum Eurodance was also common during the Y2K Era. Aqua, the Danish band responsible for the 1997 hit \"Barbie Girl\", is often attributed as being the most popular example of this genre, with an honorable mention going to the Italian group Eiffel 65, known for their 1998 single \"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\". The Y2K aesthetic can also be seen in the music video to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Californication\". The video takes the form of a fictional open-world video game that depicts each of the band members on an adventure in a California setting. R&B and hip-hop also transitioned from the Golden Age/G-Funk/Boom Bap Era to the Jiggy/Bling/Shiny Suit 97 Era (widely known as the Hype Williams era, because of the prevalence of these visual cues in his music videos), with producers like Timbaland, Swizz Beatz, and The Neptunes. Many R&B and hip-hop artists used Y2K aesthetics in music videos, including TLC in their \"No Scrubs\" video, Aaliyah in \"Are You That Somebody\", Jennifer Lopez in \"If You Had My Love\", and Janet Jackson in \"Doesn't Really Matter\". Alternative rock and post-grunge were popular at this time and used in media such as Hollywood films and AMVs. Rap/hip-hop were similarly popular, and the popularity of it during this time influenced 2000s soundtracks later in the decade such as the ones for Homestuck and Scribblenauts and 2010s soundtracks like the OST for Persona 4: The Animation. Since Y2K was about embracing the future, the tone of music also reflected this. Electronic music was the go-to genre to capture this era as a musician, and other popular genres at the time were Eurodance, Jumpstyle, Britpop, R&B, etc. Some Record labels associated with Y2K Futurism include System Records and Eldia. Orion's Arm may be the final sci-fi literary work since the 20th century to develop a world bigger by many people—which embraced prominent internet trends at the time—but would later make an aesthetic combining said aesthetic, Frutiger Aero, Hexatron, Biopunk, Weirdcore, Randumb, Webcore, Robotcore, Technical Scene, Xpiritualism, Silicon Dreams, Gen X Soft Club, and Abstract Tech. Homestar Runner was also a major part of Y2K era culture. When people think of Y2K Futurism gaming, most could tell us about the Fifth (PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, GameBoy Color) and Sixth (Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Game Boy Advance) generations of consoles, as well as arcade hardware such as the Sega Naomi and Konami System 573 their respective lines of games, and their Low Poly visuals (particularly noticeable in the 5th Gen games). During the late '90s and early 2000s, Sega produced one last console before withdrawing from the hardware industry. The Dreamcast, released in 1999, had shown Sega's ability to make creative and innovative games. The most Y2K Futurism-esque game was 1999's Space Channel 5, a rhythm game intended for a \"casual female audience\" that was applauded for its retro art style and soundtrack, encapsulating a lot of what people admired about Y2K aesthetics. Another Dreamcast game that could be considered Y2K Futurism-inspired is 2000's Jet Set Radio, which, while not having the slick designs of Space Channel 5, captured other aspects such as Japanese punk fashion and early 2000s hip-hop. Jet Set Radio would also use iconography-inspired graphics for its UI. Jet Set Radio Future, its 2002 sequel, integrated even more Y2K aesthetics into its art and gameplay, as did the series' spiritual successor, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk. Rez, released by Sega/UGA in 2001 for the Dreamcast and 2002 for the PS2, had a wireframe-y Y2K Futurism aesthetic, as the game centered round a computer virus nicknamed Swayzak invading the mainframe of a computer to reveal the true being at her core. On the other hand, the series of Dreamcast network games, including ChuChu Rocket!, released in 1999 for the Dreamcast and 2001 for the GBA, as well as Dee Dee Planet, in production around 1999 until cancelled in 2001, had a heavy Y2K Futurism iconography and bold minimalism as the main aesthetics of both games. In particular, secret movies that can be collected within Dee Dee Planet contains visual compilations of Y2K imagery and graphics that was popular around the year of its production, thus cementing the game within the zeitgeist of Y2K Futurism. Yet more Sega games that embodied this aesthetic are Sonic R (1997), Sonic Adventure (1998), Sonic Adventure 2 (2001), and Sonic Heroes (2003), particularly SA1 with its janky-yet-charming visuals and atmospheric Y2K music. On the Sony end of the spectrum, no game series does a better job of embodying the Y2K Futurism aesthetic than the Wipeout series, with art done by the aforementioned Designers Republic, even with recent iterations like Wipeout HD (2008) and Wipeout 2048 (2012). Metal Gear Solid, developed by Konami, had a lot of Y2K aesthetics too. Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere also used Y2K Futurism aesthetics in its user interface, fictional aircraft designs, and soundtrack. Most PlayStation Magazine demo discs, particularly the ones released in Europe from 1997 to 2004, are known for their very heavy use of Y2K Futurism visuals in its menu interface, typically CGI for PS1 discs, and graphic designs for PS2 discs. Music tracks that were used in these menus are associated with the popular Y2K electronic sounds around these years. Other companies attempted to use Y2K aesthetics as a promotion for consoles, controllers, and games. Even Flash games on websites had the Y2K Futurism aesthetic, such as Cartoon Network's Toonami games (Toonami: Trapped in Hyperspace in particular being a whole 3D FPS similar to Y2K aesthetic games Descent and Virus: The Game). Some other games that could be considered Y2K Futurism aesthetic would include as follows: Recently, the indie game scene started to get inspired by the Y2K Futurism revival wave and the developers to revisit the aesthetic. One of the first games is CROSSNIQ+, a puzzle arcade game mimicking the Dreamcast puzzles made by Max Krieger. BallisticNG is a futuristic racing game inspired by the Wipeout series. Another example is Hypnospace Outlaw and its upcoming sequel, Dreamsettler. Hypnospace, a game taking place in 1999, has its last parts of the game taking place in an upgraded operating system with Y2K Futurism stylization, and its upcoming sequel Dreamsettler takes place in 2003, with an OS inspired by Y2K-stylized operating systems of its time, like Mac OS X and Windows XP. The upcoming indie game Neon White, and varied indie first-person shooter games SPRAWL, Ghostware: Arena of the Dead, and EXOCIDE, all yet to be released soon, embrace this aesthetic as well. Roblox is also involved, as it had in early development a lot of Y2K Futurism-esque elements and nowadays Y2K skins and accessories are made by the community for example. Y2K Futurism aesthetics were used in architecture, such as the Encounter Restaurant at LAX, which opened in 1997, and was the filming location of the US music video for Moloko's \"Fun For Me.\" Even theme park attractions used the Y2K Futurism aesthetic. One of the earliest examples of Y2K Futurism could be considered The ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter, which opened at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom park in December 1994. Disney would later capitalize on the Y2K aesthetic with DisneyQuest, a virtual reality entertainment center located in Walt Disney World's Downtown Disney, with a second location in Chicago, Illinois. They also had the ESPN Zone dining and interactive experiences in major cities. On the other side of the pond, Sega opened Sega World Sydney in Darling Harbour, Australia, and Sega World London at the Trocadero in London. Sega also partnered with DreamWorks to establish GameWorks, a series of arcades found at major cities. External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic:",

As the term can also be used as an adjective, its interpretation can vary a lot depending on the context as a character being described as Yami Kawaii can simply refer to their personality being dark and cute without visually representing the aesthetic. It is often confused with the Gurokawa aesthetic, which has a focus on cutified horror, but Yami Kawaii has more of shoujo spin to it with many anime-style illustrations involved, and is not bloody or gory. The aesthetic first emerged among the members of Japan's mental health subculture \"Menhera\" during the 2000s, but didn't have an own name until 2015. The initial purpose of the aesthetic was to have a creative outlet to cope with mental health issues while also challenging the social stigma that judges a person's suffering by a bad appearance. However, with the increasing media awareness of Yami Kawaii there also came an over-commercialization that reduced it to simply medical motifs. Generally Yami Kawaii is kept in dark colors to match its negative world view. While pastel colors are also used, it's usually for the purpose of making important details stand out from the rest of the image. Morbid elements are often not noticeable at first glance within the overall cute imagery. There are many medical items, suicide and self harm tools, negative messages, vent art images, and traces of pink blood. While there are many ways that Yami Kawaii can be integrated into fashion, the most common seem to be dark casual outfits featuring motifs with opposing elements, like cute animals with negative texts, in the form of prints. There are also many medical accessories such as Band-Aid hair clips, syringe necklaces, and pill bracelets due to the nature of the aesthetic. Makeup is worn regardless of gender in Yami Kawaii in order to archive a sickly look by applying pink or red blush right under the eyes instead of the traditional use on the apple of the cheeks, and is often further exaggerated by enchanting the natural eye bag line. Lips are usually kept very simple but gradients are also very popular. Popular artists within Yami Kawaii include: There's also many VOCALOID producers who are popular within the aesthetic's community because of the combination of depressing themes with the adorable voices of the characters in their songs, such as: The spread of Yami Kawaii is often credited to have been helped by the character and manga series \"Menhera-chan\" in particular. It was first created in 2013 by the artist Bisuko Ezaki as a form of vent art character during his university entrance exams, but gained an unexpected amount of attention that led to an expansion into an own manga series as of 2014. Because of the background of its creation, the story of Menhera-chan is not suitable for everyone because of its heavy emphasis on themes of self-harm, and might even be misunderstood as romanticizing such a topic as the main cast transforms into magical girls by the means of slitting their wrists. With the increasing awareness of the series, there also appeared a massive influx of people who solely use the art of the characters for the purpose of glorifying self-harm. On Twitter in particular, it has become commonplace for the official Menhera-chan account to share fan content from accounts of such people, potentially exposing strangers to graphic content. While the series inspired many other people to use art as as a creative outlet to break the silence regarding their suffering, there also have been many critical voices claiming the increasing popularity went over Bisuko Ezaki's head, fueled by his attempt to register Yami Kawaii as his trademark in 2017 [1] as well as an increase in general drama and problematic remarks from the artist.[2] External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

        "description": "Yanki\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther names\nYankii, Japanese Rockabilly\n\n\nDecade of origin\n1950s and 1960s\n\n\nKey motifs\nJapanese gangster\n\n\nKey colours\nblack, yellow, white\n\n\nKey values\nrebellion\n\n\nRelated aesthetics\nBosozokuSukebanGyaruGreaserYakuzaBankara Yanki (ヤンキー) consists of young men and women who dye their hair blond or orange, wear trashy clothes and smoke, drink before they're out of high school. They are famous for being loud, rude and refusing to take part in the strict manners of Japanese society. In addition to the specific aesthetic, Yanki can be a general term to refer to the delinquent groups in Japan. For example, Sukeban, Gyaru, Bosozoku, and Teamer, can be considered Yanki. The Yankii subculture lasted a long time in Japan; it originated from the '50s, gained its name in the '70s, and then flourished with popularity throughout the '80s and '90s. People stopped adopting the aesthetic in real life after the 2000s, but it still remains popular in anime and manga to this day. Yanki could be recognized by punch perms or pompadours, shaved eyebrows, altered school uniforms, popping squats, being poor students and causing violence or trouble. Yanki is a term that applies to both boys and girls, but some girls split into a seperate subculture called Sukeban. Although it is rumored that yankii would be recruited into the yakuza (the Japanese mafia), this is not always true. Many yanki simply joined the regular workforce and lived regular, productive lives after high school. The name \"yankii\" is borrowed from the English word \"Yankee\", a name taken from the American GIs who gave the Japanese their first glimpse into the world of rock ‘n’ roll.[1]\nYankii was heavily influenced by the American culture brought over by US soldiers. Sukajan, which were souvenir jackets inspired by American letter jackets originally targeted towards soldiers deployed at US Military base in Yokosuka, were then commonly worn by the local Yankii imitating US soldiers in the fashion movement known as \"Sukaman\". [2] The popularity of Sukajan spread through the entire country and became more associated with Yankii after being featured in the movie Pigs and Battleships.[3] Yankii haircuts such as Pompadour were inspired by the Greaser subculture. Along with sukajan, Yankii are known for wearing a long jacket with high collars known as the \"chouran\" (長ラン), typically ones in black color. It is a type of modified \"gakuran\" (学ラン), which is the military-style male school uniform of many Japanese middle-schools and high-schools. The chouran originated from the Bankara fashion that had died out but then lived on through the uniform for the leaders of Tokyo cheer teams, where it then became adopted by yankiis and spread to schools across the country.[4] The chouran is often seen worn on the shoulders unbuttoned in order to give it an even bigger appearance. It also common to see chouran embroidered and modified with kanji, similar to tokku-fuku. Japanese Rockabilly originated in the 1950's and combines the Rockabilly music and dancing of that time period with the fashion of Greaser. Similar to Yanki, it was spread to Japan from the American soldiers deployed there. [5] The fashion comprises of black Greaser jackets and jeans. Women could wear this style, but they also are known to wear 50's dresses and poodle skirts with polka dot and floral designs. Men's hairstyles harken back somewhat to the 1950s American biker, with the iconic, huge, and tall pompadour being the main hairstyle. More information at Japanese Fashion Wiki: Rockabilly. The Teamers (チーマー) are a type of delinquent in Japan that refer to their groups as \"teams\" rather than gangs, influenced by American Hip-Hop culture. They originated from the area surrounding the street named Center Gai in Shibuya, Tokyo. They wore a style of street fashion inspired by American casual fashion that was called Shibu-Kaji, Shibuya Casual.[6] They are known for wearing American-produced clothing such as Leather jackets. The Gyaru subculture has also been associated with Teamers due to some of the girlfriends of members being Kogal.[7] Yanki tend to be part of a tight-knit community that was created during middle school and stayed together through adulthood. Some stereotypes (throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s) included men entering the field of construction, while women were teen mothers who dropped out of highschool. Yankii also maintain a strict social code with specific customs. Groups tend to have fighting codes that are focus on limiting violence. Cars and motorcycles can also be a part of the Yanki lifestyle.[8] There are many Yankī movies, most of them being B action movies.",

It appears like the embodiment of a “girl's dream” and you can find many illustrations, clothing, and goods, which incorporate this aesthetic. Due to the nature of dreams, it can also feature nightmarish elements. Although the concept of the aesthetic has existed for some time, it wasn't until 2013 that it started to spread under the name Yume Kawaii. Eventually, the rise of image-centric social media platforms gave birth to online groups such as \"Strawberry Milk Gang\" (いちごみるく団) that were a major contributor to shaping the aesthetic with their image edits. In 2015, Yume Kawaii caught the attention of companies, and pastel-colored goods with the aesthetic in mind hit up the shelves, spreading its popularity among a mainstream aducience. As mentioned previously, Yume Kawaii doesn't only consist of nice dreams but also nightmares. Due to that, there's also image edits and artworks that embody this pale cuteness and slightly sad poems. There's also many artists who focus on the Yume Kawaii aesthetic. One of the most well-known illustrators who represents Yume Kawaii is Kato Rei. He has released his first artbook \"Girl Friend\" in 2015, featuring a romantic world view drawn in pastel colors, embodying Yume Kawaii. Yume Kawaii fashion includes feathers, frills, ribbons, and other fluffy materials in its looks. The outfits usually consist of printed tops with a sailor collar, sheer jackets, poofy skirts or pants, loose socks, and platform shoes. Sleeping mask headdresses and pillow bags are also popular. While Fairy Kei emits a vintage, retro kind of kawaii, Yume Kawaii covers many modern styles and features lots of motifs related to Japanese pop culture, such as magical girls, strawberry milk, and conpeitou. The hair is often bleached and dyed to archive high tones like milk tea, pastel pink, and lavender; but wigs in fluffy styles are also very common. There are many circle lenses, glitter under the eyes, and very pop impressions. And there is an important element: the \"sleepy\" look. People achieve this look by applying an excessive amount of blush under their eyes. Popular artists within Yume Kawaii include: External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.",

It was closely associated with a Yugoslavian magazine called ZENIT[1] and it had a major presence in visual arts, graphic design, poetry, literature, theatre, film, architecture and music from 1921 to 1926.   The Zenitists rejected traditionalism and believed in the concept of an unified European culture, something beyond the common political division of the time (\"East\" and \"West\"), and sought to create an aesthetic that incorporated influence from both Western European and Eastern European culture. They drew inspiration from art movements like Cubism and German Expressionism, as well as elements of Balkan folklore and ancient Byzantine art. It especially shared various similiarities with Italian Futurism. Zenitism was estabilished by Ljubomir Micić, a Serbian artist of Avant-garde Socialist ideology, during the aftermath of World War I, in June 1921, along with the \"Zenitist Manifesto\", which explained the general ideas, principles and philosophy of the aesthetic. The art movement had its own magazine called Zenit, based in Zagreb (1921-1924) and later in Belgrade (1924-1926), in which the Zenitist artists published their ideas and artworks. The magazine gained international traction, becoming one of the most revelant European art movements from the Balkan region. However, the art movement started to decline in 1926 after the Zenit magazine was ultimately censored by the Yugoslavian government. Although Zenitism was a relatively short-lived art movement, it had an important impact in Balkan art. Some visuals prominent in Zenitism include: The artists of the Zenitist movement rejected traditional art forms as well as traditionalism as a whole in their artworks. They believed that art should be an innovative form of media and reflect and express the inner world of the artist, as well as rejecting Realism. Another main value of Zenitism was rejecting the concept of a politically divided Europe. The 1920s weren't easy times in what was considered the \"east\" of Europe, in the traditional political sense. After all, the country had just gone through the dread of World War I. Therefore, Zenitists believed that the political separation in blocks was untrue and unnecessary, and they sought to create an aesthetic that combined influence from both worlds. Zenitists were also against the concept of Military and believed in Humanism (the philosophy surrounding the value of human life). Zenitism as an art movement was founded by Ljubomir Micić and Branko Večerin, who published the first ZENIT magazine in 1921, until 1926, when it ultimately faced censorship. The magazine was used as a platform for Zenitist artists and writers to express their ideas and to promote their artworks. Zenitism also had a strong connection to Dadaism and Dada-related activities.",

It centers around a person, or group of people, trying to survive a situation wherein civilization collapses due to hordes of zombies, which are infectious creatures of the undead who consume humans. The genre has also inspired a brand of aesthetics in which people roleplay as zombies, or pretend the zombie apocalypse is real. The aesthetic can also be tied into conspiracy theories about zombies and zombie movies. Zombie apocalypse was partly an inspiration for Coffinwood, specifically its elements of decrepit Americana. However, Coffinwood is only based around the countryside, while zombie apocalypse often features urban areas as well. The term \"zombie\" originates from Haitian folklore and the Vodou religion. The Zombie Apocalypse genre started in the movie Night of the Living Dead. Although the creatures in the movie weren't supposed to be based on zombies of Haitian folklore, fans of the movie noticed the similarity and began calling them zombies.[1] Zombiecore utilizes dark colors, such as black, gray, tan and brown, and accents it with brighter colors like red, orange, and yellow, to create an unsettling appearance. These colors are typically the main colors of zombiecore outfits as well as colored zombiecore pictures. Warning signs, old buildings, and derelict cities all contribute to the post-apocalypticism of the aesthetic. Cites of importance, especially government buildings, are common motifs and places used in the images, used to further the concept of zombies complete takeover of populous areas.",
